The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The goal of this study was to determine the contribution of these metabolites to drug-drug interactions caused by ITZ. Six healthy volunteers received 100 mg ITZ orally for 7 days, and pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted at days 1 and 7 of the study. The extent of CYP3A4 inhibition by ITZ and its metabolites was predicted using this data. ITZ, OH-ITZ, keto-ITZ, and ND-ITZ were detected in plasma samples of all volunteers. A 3.9-fold decrease in the hepatic intrinsic clearance of a CYP3A4 substrate was predicted using the average unbound steady-state concentrations (C(ss,ave,u)) and liver microsomal inhibition constants for ITZ, OH-ITZ, keto-ITZ, and ND-ITZ. Accounting for circulating metabolites of ITZ significantly improved the in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of CYP3A4 inhibition compared to a consideration of ITZ exposure alone.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The azole nitrogen atoms in the chemical structure of itraconazole form a complex with the active site, or the haem iron, of the fungal enzyme to impede its function. The accumulation of lanosterol and 14-methylated sterols results in increased permeability of the fungal cell membrane, and modified membrane-bound enzyme activity, and dysregulated chitin synthesis. Other proposed mechanisms of action of itraconazole include the inhibition of fungal cytochrome c oxidative and peroxidative enzymes that also lead to the disruption of fungal cell membranes.",

The liver injury from itraconazole typically presents 1 to 6 months after starting therapy with symptoms of fatigue and jaundice. The pattern of serum enzyme elevations is typically cholestatic (Case 1), but cases of severe hepatitis with acute liver failure typically have a hepatocellular enzyme pattern (Case 2). Immunoallergic features (rash, fever, eosinophilia) are uncommon as is autoantibody formation. Recovery upon stopping therapy can be delayed for several weeks and generally takes 4 to 10 weeks, although in some cases recovery may be prolonged.",

Therefore, concomitant administration of itraconazole and quinidine or dofetilide is contraindicated. The class IA antiarrhythmic disopyramide has the potential to increase the QT interval at high plasma concentrations.

Beginning ductopenia was present in two, suggesting that itraconazole might be responsible for the occurrence of prolonged drug-induced cholangiopathy. Jaundice was the presenting symptom in all three. It was not accompanied by clinical hallmarks of hypersensitivity, which is suggestive for metabolic rather than for immunoallergic idiosyncrasy.

An otherwise healthy 30-year-old man treated with itraconazole developed frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVC). He presented with a dry cough and palpitation. The results of 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) were essentially normal, but Holter ECG revealed 17,484 (18%) uniform PVC, including 4 short runs among 96,930 beats/day. Another Holter ECG after withdrawing itraconazole revealed 1,032 premature atrial contractions but no PVC. The corrected QT interval was 0.39 s without itraconazole, 0.41 s with itraconazole, and 0.43 s when multiple PVC were documented. Itraconazole inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 that is involved in fungal cell membrane formation, interrupts human cytochrome P450A4 in the liver and causes adverse interactions with various drugs such as antiarrythmics, but its cardiac side-effects are obscure. Both patients and physicians should be aware that itraconazole can cause PVC as a side-effect.",

A new azole antifungal agent, D 0870, was administered to the patient for 7 days orally, and itraconazole (400 mg/day) was started. After 1 month of chemotherapy, facial and pretibial edema were observed and the patient's serum potassium concentration decreased to 2.5 mEq/L. A chest radiograph disclosed cardiomegaly with cardiac effusion and right pleural effusion on admission. The serum potassium concentration rose after the cessation of itraconazole therapy. The serum ITCZ concentration remained high for 2 weeks after admission. Although reports of hypopotassemia induced by ITCZ are rare, /investigators/ concluded that blood concentrations should be monitored more carefully when treating pulmonary aspergilloma patients with high-dose regimens of ITCZ.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.6X10-20 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates itraconazole will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase itraconazole will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Itraconazole does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, itraconazole is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 6,600. The pKa of itraconazole is 3.7, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. A biodegradation model indicates persistence on the order of months and longer, suggesting that biodegradation is not expected to be an important environmental fate process in water. If released into water, itraconazole is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A pKa of 3.7 indicates itraconazole will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 2,500 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to itraconazole may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where itraconazole is produced or used. Exposure to itraconazole among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug, an antifungal. (SRC)",

The pKa of itraconazole is 3.7(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. Itraconazole is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 2.6X10-20 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(6). A biodegradation model indicates persistence on the order of months and longer(7), suggesting that biodegradation is not expected to be an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

A pKa of 3.7(4) indicates itraconazole will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 2,500(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

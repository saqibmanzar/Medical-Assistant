This method is applicable to the determination of certain chlorinated herbicides in drinking water. It is applicable, but not limited to, the analysis of the following parent acid and salts and esters of the acid. The chemical form is not distinguished. Results are calculated and reported as total free acid. (The sample is acidified to convert any salts present to the parent acid. The acids and esters are extracted with ethyl ether. The esters are hydrolyzed and converted to acid salts with potassium hydroxide solution. ... The acids are extracted into organic phase and then convertedto their methyl esters by the use of a micro-diazomethane generator). Samples are analyzed by either packed or capillary column gas chromatography using and electron capture detector. Using this method, 2,4,5-T, N-butyl ester has an estimated detection limit (student t factor times the standard deviation of at least 7 replicate analyses) of 0.20 ug/l. Using a packed column, mean recovery is 88% with a standard deviation of 5% in reagent water. /2,4,5-T/",

                                "Description": "The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical is an airborne concentration at which a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effect.  There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Vietnam veterans who had greater estimated opportunities for agent orange exposure did not seem to be at greater risk for fathering babies with all types of defects combined. However, for a few specific types of defects the estimated risks were higher for subgroups of Vietnam veterans that may have had a greater likelihood of exposure to Agent Orange. These seemingly higher risks could be chance events, the result of some experience in the Vietnam service of the father, or the result of some other unidentified risk factor."

At normal application rates the ester hydrolyzes rapidly in soil with all the ester being converted to the parent acid in a day at 20 \u00b0C. Losses are primarily by degradation rather than leaching or volatilization. Hydrolysis in water is less rapid (half-life ca 7.5 days at pH 7.5 and 20 \u00b0C) but should be greatly accelerated when adsorbed to soil or particulate matter. While the ester is predicted to bioconcentrate in fish, this effect should be mitigated due to its hydrolysis. While evidence is lacking for this particular ester, the more volatile phenoxy herbicides may be transported moderate distances in air. Vapor phase 2,4,5-T, butyl ester reacts slowly with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere (half-life 3.7 days). Aerosols will be subject to rainout and gravitational settling and photodegradation. Exposure is primarily occupational and will be primarily by inhalation and dermal contact. (SRC)",

One gallon of Orange contained approximately 4.6 pounds of the acid equivalent of 2,4,5-T. The specified formulation for Orange was 50% by weight of the n-butyl ester of 2,4,5-T. Assuming one gallon of Orange weighed 10.7 pounds, one gallon of the specified formulation of Orange would contain approximately 5.4 pounds of the n-butyl ester of 2,4,5-T. Therefore, Orange applied at three gallons per acre is estimated to have released a maximum of 13.8 pounds per acre of the acid equivalent of 2,4,5-T and 16.2 pounds per acre of the n-butyl ester of 2,4,5-T per spraying. The actual amount of 2,4,5-T released per acre was probably less than estimated because, actual samples of Orange contained less than 50% by weight of the n-butyl ester of 2,4,5-T. Furthermore, spray drift and volatilization generally reduced the amount deposited per acre. Canopy cover in heavily forested areas would, as in the case of other chemicals, greatly reduce the amount of ester reaching ground level.",

Soil and vegetation samples were collected at regular intervals and a stream at the bottom of the trial area was monitored continuously over 6 mo. Only 0.6% of the applied herbicide entered the stream during the trial, with 0.4% being washed out in the first storm. Measurable traces of the original ester formulation, 2,4,5-T (acid), and the principal breakdown product 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-TCP), with a combined avg of about 0.4 mg/kg, were found in pasture vegetation 6 mo after initial application. The persistence of these residues may be a cause of dietary intake by grazing livestock. Soil residues (expressed as butyl ester) persisted throughout the study, principally as 2,4,5-TCP (12-100 ng/g after 185 days), and were also detected from a treatment 1 yr before the trial began (20-90 ng/g). An estimate of the masses of residues and losses 6 days after spraying accounted for about 20% of the applied mass. A significant part of the balance (80%) is thought to have been lost in spray drift.",

The soil type and rainfall in the three areas were: sandy loam (0.5% organic matter (OM), pH 5.6), 150 cm; silt loam (1.7% OM, pH 7), 40 cm; and clay loam (1.4% OM, pH 7.8), 15 cm, respectively. After 2 yrs, the acid of 2,4,5-T compromised most of the total residue at all sites, and 90% of that was confined to the top 15 cm of the soil profile. The application of lime, organic matter, or fertilizer did not increase the rate of disappearance. However the incorporation of activated charcoal impeded degradation, probably by binding the herbicide(2).",

The analysis did not distinguish between the acid or the ester. Little or no degradation occurred over the first four cool winter months. At the lower application rate, the Washington and Wyoming soils respectively contained 2.4 and 0.5% of the applied ester after 28 months(2). In experiments the following year, residues in Mississippi and Washington soils were reduced to 47.9 and 7.9% after 20 months(2). Most of the residue was found in the top 10 cm; 3.74%, 0.33%, and 2.08% were found in the 10-30 cm depth in the Washington, Wyoming, and Mississippi soils, respectively(2).

Hydrolysis is catalyzed by acid or base. The ester will adsorb to humic material in the water column. Humic material not only adsorbs the ester but exerts a pH dependent catalytic effect on the hydrolysis, the result of which would be to retard hydrolysis in basic waters and accelerate it in acid waters. Therefore, the rate of disappearence of the n-butyl ester of 2,4,5-T from natural waters will be dependent on pH and on the amount of humic materials in the water. The half-life is speculative but would probably vary from days to weeks(SRC).",

The method of herbicide application had significant impact on the amt applied per unit area and hence on residue persistence: spills > or = soil incorporation > aerial application. 2,4,5-T was more persistent in the soil than 2,4-D. The formulation of the herbicide also had significant impact on its persistence: isooctyl ester > butyl ester > acid. The addition of coconut charcoal increases persistence of the phenoxy herbicide residues, especially residues of 2,4,5-T. The appearance of dichlorophenol and trichlorophenol in soils treated with 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T suggests that they are degradation products of the herbicides. A massive concn of herbicides does not sterilize the soils. Apparently, microbial populations respond both quantitatively and qualitatively to the presence of high concentrations of herbicides and may play an important role in their degradation. The contaminant 2,3,7,8-TCDD had a long persistence time in soils (years) and may be a major consideration in the use of soil biodegradation as a disposal option for unwanted phenoxy herbicides or TCDD-contaminated chemical wastes.",

After 24 hr all ester had disappeared from the moistened to the wilting point. 70-100% of the ester was recovered after 24 hr from the air dried soil(1). The rapidity of the hydrolysis combined with the fact no detectable hydrolysis was observed after 30 minutes in 0.1 M calcium chloride suggests that the hydrolysis is abiotic and soil-catalyzed(1). The product of hydrolysis is the parent acid, 2,4,5-T(1). Hydrolysis of phenoxyacetic esters is catalyzed by acids and base. However, catalysis by acid is less effective than by base(2). The hydrolytic half-life of the n-butyl ester of 2,4,5-T is 1.4, 7.5 and 12.8 days at 20 \u00b0C at pH 8.4, 7.5, and 5.4, respectively(2).

Hydrolysis in natural waters in the presence of humic material is affected by the adsorption of a fraction of the substrate to the humic material. Under acidic conditions, the humic acid catalyzes the reaction resulting in accelerated hydrolysis while under basic conditions the adsorbed material is simply less available resulting in a decrease of the overall hydrolysis rate(2). A recent theoretical model which has been put forward not only accounts for the decrease of alkaline hydrolysis rate by humic matter but also an increase in the acid hydrolysis rate(3). Vapor phase 2,4,5-T, n-butyl ester will react with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere primarily by H-atom abstraction. Assuming a hydroxyl radical concentration of 5X10+5 per cu cm, its half-life is estimated to be 3.7 days(4). The esters of 2,4,5-T should adsorb UV radiation > 290 nm(1); however, photochemical degradation of the 2,4,5-T esters in air or in water has not been demonstrated.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The winter of 1976-1977 was mild and relatively dry, and little leachate could be collected. Subsequent winters were wet and the soil columns were saturated by the following springs. 2,4-D (< 1 ppm) was found in leachates from Washington and Wyoming soils receiving the herbicide application in 1976 or 1977 and > 30 ppm was found in leachates from Washington soil treated in 1978. 2,4-D (> 10 ppm) was found in leachates from the acidic Mississippi soil receiving high rate of herbicide application in 1977 or 1978. Concentrations of 2,4,5-T in the same leachates were higher for the Washington and Wyoming soils, but lower (than corresponding concentrations of 2,4-D) for the Mississippi soil. In all cases, 96-99% of the undegraded herbicides ... remained in the 0-10 cm soil layer after 2-3 winters, and only 0.14-1.65% of the 2,4,-D and 0.33-3.7% of the 2,4,5-T remaining ... were present in the 10-30 cm depths.

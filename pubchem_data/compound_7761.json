When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Diethyl malonate was validated as a simulant for 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl methylphosphonofluoridate (soman) by comparison of the skin penetration and decontamination of radiolabeled diethyl malonate to the radiolabeled phosphonofluoridate in shower decontamination trials of pig skin in vitro. Percutaneous penetration of diethyl malonate was significantly greater than that of the phosphonofluoridate during the 15-min period after application. However, both were less than 0.1% of the applied dose. Showering or thickener had no significant effect on the percutaneous penetration of diethyl malonate or the phosphonofluoridate. Most of the phosphonofluoridate removed by showering or scrubbing the skin was inactivated. The quantity of intact 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl methylphosphonofluoridate that penetrated through the skin was below the detection limit of the enzymatic analysis. There was no statistically significant difference between the phosphonofluoridate and diethyl malonate in efficacy of shower decontamination. The presence of thickener did not have a significant effect on decontamination efficacy.",

The extent of hydrolysis from the skin surface, skin, and receptor fluid was determined. A significant skin-mediated hydrolysis (15-35% of applied dose) was observed for diethyl malonate in normal skin, but not in heat-treated skin. These results indicated that a heat labile process (e.g., enzymatic hydrolysis) was in part responsible for the degradation of diethyl malonate after topical application to normal skin. Heat treatment tripled the skin penetration of diisopropyl fluorophosphate and reduced the amount of recovered hydrolysis product, diisopropyl phosphoric acid. Enzymatic and spontaneous hydrolysis, as well as impurity, accounted for the presence of degradation product.",

According to this process, dimethyl, diethyl, and diisopropyl malonates are produced by a dicobalt octacarbonyl-catalyzed reaction of chloroacetates (methyl, ethyl, or isopropyl) with carbon monoxide in the presence of the appropriate alcohol. In the case of diethyl malonate the reaction is conducted at around 100 \u00b0C and 18 bar at pH 5.7. Ethyl acetate is formed as a major byproduct. After completion of the reaction, sodium chloride and catalyst are separated. The alcohol and the low-boiling components are distilled off and the nonconverted chloroacetate recovered by distillation. The crude ethyl malonate obtained is purified by redistillation.",

In this paper, an integration of LG/GC using retention gap technique with partially concurrent solvent evaporation, as a efficient chromatographic system for sample preconcentration and preseparation, was coupled into FTIR system in order to overcome the detectability problems of GC/FTIR analysis. The applicability of the on-line LG-GC/FTIR method is demonstrated by analysis of the isomers of divinylbenzene in purified diethyl malonate under conditions of hexane/dichloromethane (85:15) used as mobile phase in LC, solvent evaporation temperature of 75 degrees C and inlet pressure of 0.20MPa etc.",

HUMAN STUDIES: A maximization test was reported in 23 volunteers. 4% of the test substance in petrolatum produced no sensitization reactions. Tested at 4% in petrolatum it produced no irritation after a 48-hr closed-patch test on human subjects. ANIMAL STUDIES: Diethyl malonate causes moderate irritation to rabbit's eyes and is non-irritating to rabbit's skin. Application of 0.005 mL of undiluted diethyl malonate to the rabbit cornea caused severe burning. Diethyl malonate fed to rats for 90 days at more than 100 times the equivalent of the human daily dietary intake (averaging 35.93 mg/kg bw per day for males and 41.14 mg/kg bw per day for females) had no adverse effects. The maximum time for inhalation of the concentrated vapor of diethyl malonate by rats without deaths was found to be 8 hr. Mutagenicity test in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 1538 was negative with and without activation at concentrations of 8, 40, 200, 1000, 5000 ug/plate 5000 ug/plate (maximal concentration).",

Diethyl malonate occurs in a variety of fruits such as pineapples, grapes, strawberries, melon and blackberry. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.19 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diethyl malonate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diethyl malonate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.1 days. Diethyl malonate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diethyl malonate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur based upon a an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. In chemical stimulant studies simulating chemical warfare agents, diethyl malonate deposited to dry soil and foliar surfaces was rapidly lost through volatilization processes with observed half-lives on soil of about 2 hours (fast) to 5-16 hours (residual material); foliar half-lives ranged from 1 to 242 hours. Two screening studies found diethyl malonate to be readily biodegradable indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, diethyl malonate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 23 and 173 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important fate process in neutral and alkaline waters. The hydrolysis half-life at pH 7 (25 \u00b0C) is 137.5 hours and <2.5 hr at pH 9 (50 \u00b0C). Occupational exposure to diethyl malonate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diethyl malonate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to diethyl malonate via inhalation of volatile aromas from fruits, ingestion of food, and dermal contact with consumer products containing diethyl malonate.

Vapor-phase diethyl malonate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.1 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.4X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Diethyl malonate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3.1 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The hydrolysis of diethyl malonate was studied using OECD Guideline 111(2). At pH 4 and 50 \u00b0C), hydrolysis was <10% after 5 days; at pH 7, the hydrolysis half-life was 15.9 and 137.5 hr at 50 and 25 \u00b0C respectively; at pH 9, the half-life was <2.4 hr at 50 \u00b0C(2). It was noted that the hydrolysis initially yielded the monoester followed by hydrolysis to malonic acid(2). Diethyl malonate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). The rate constant for the OH radical reaction of diethyl malonate with hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solutions at pH 6-7 is 6.5X10+8 L/mol-sec(4); this corresponds to an aquatic half-life of 3.38 years at an aquatic concentration of 1X10-17 hydroxyl radicals per liter(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that diethyl malonate is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 23 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 173 days(SRC). Diethyl malonate's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). In chemical stimulant studies simulating chemical warfare agents, diethyl malonate deposited to dry soil and foliar surfaces is rapidly lost through volatilization processes with observed half-lives on soil of about 2 hours (fast) to 5-16 hours (residual material)(4); foliar half-lives ranged from 1 to 242 hours(4).",

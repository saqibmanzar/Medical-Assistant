PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

In postshift urine samples, the mean concentration of dinitroaminotoluene was 9.7 mg/l (standard deviation= 7.9, n= 219). TNT was shown to be absorbed rapidly during the exposure period. A wide variation among individuals in the rate of clearance of TNT metabolites was seen. For the group as a whole the daily mean urinary total dinitroaminotoluene concentrations in preshift samples were lower than those in postshift samples although in some cases higher concentrations of metabolites were seen in samples taken the morning after exposure. Urine samples collected after 17 days away from the workplace still showed detectable levels of dinitroaminotoluene (mean 0.06 mg dinitroaminotoluene/l) indicating that a proportion of TNT or its metabolites is slowly excreted.",

TNT was absorbed in all species by all routes of admin with the most extensive absorption occurring after intratracheal instillation. Dermal absorption was the highest in rabbits followed by mice, rats, and dogs. Species differences in the rate of oral absorption could not be accurately assessed. Excretion was primarily in urine and to a lesser extent in feces. Extensive biliary excretion was also noted. Blood and tissue levels in females were generally higher than in males.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide were measured in mitochondria and microsomes from livers of monkeys treated with 0, 60, or 120 mg/kg/day of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene for 12 weeks ... The amount of superoxide radicals was indirectly measured by the formation of adrenochrome from adrenalin, and hydrogen peroxide production was evaluated by the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde. There was a dose-dependent increase in superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide production in liver mitochondria and microsomes ... These findings were confirmed when mitochondria and microsomes obtained from various organs were treated in vitro with 0, 0.04, 0.2, or 1 mmol of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and then tested for adrenochrome and formaldehyde production. Different amounts of hydrogen peroxide were produced in the mitochondria of the various organs. The highest amount of hydrogen peroxide was present in the liver followed by brain, testicle, kidney cortex, and kidney medulla ...",

Hemolytic anemia has been described in workers with a genetic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Reduced hemoglobin values were seen with exposures as low as 0.48 mg/m3. Cataracts were induced in 6 of 12 workers exposed at 0.14 to 0.58 mg/m3 for 6.8 [+/-] 4.7 years and in 7 of 9 workers exposed at 0.10 to 0.35 mg/m3 for 1 to 27 years (average of 14 years). Listed in the table Examples of Industrial Chemicals for Which Methemoglobin Formation is NOT the Principal Cause of Toxicity; [ACGIH] May stain the skin yellow and cause dermatitis; Other potential adverse effects are methemoglobinemia, hemolysis, liver injury, and jaundice.

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The initial explosion occurred in a room where workers made \"boosters\" small explosive devices used in the mining industry to detonate larger explosives. A second, more powerful blast destroyed a building used for drying explosives, leaving a 40- by-60-foot crater that was up to six feet deep. The two explosions destroyed buildings, blew down walls, and hurled debris as far as a thousand yards. Of the 11 Sierra employees who were at the site when the accident occurred, only one escaped without injury. The explosions killed all four workers who were in or near Booster Room 2, the production room where the first blast occurred. In nearby Booster Room 1, one worker was blown 14 feet by the force of that initial blast. He and four others were trapped as the room collapsed, but all survived. The explosions had the force of a magnitude 2.0 earthquake and were felt some 20 miles away from the plant. Fearing further blasts, firefighters did not attempt to extinguish fires at the site, and the flames burned for more than a day. Sierra Chemical estimated that in all, 47,000 pounds of explosives were consumed during the accident. The facility was never rebuilt. MIXER BLADE LIKELY DETONATED EXPLOSIVE.  Producing boosters involved melting, mixing, blending, and pouring trinitrotoluene (TNT) and other raw materials into cardboard cylinders. The work was performed inside Booster Rooms 1 and 2, which were located in two adjoining buildings. In a separate building the chemical pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) was dried before being transferred to the booster production buildings. PETN is one of the strongest high explosives known, and due to its instability it is transported wet. Although there were no surviving eyewitnesses in Booster Room 2, the Chemical Safety Board (CSB) used seismic evidence and other techniques to reconstruct what happened on the morning of January 7. Booster Room 2 had housed four large freestanding mixing pots, where explosive materials were melted and blended. The day before the accident a worker had departed early, leaving 50 to 100 pounds of melted base material in the bottom of one of the mixing pots. The base material consisted of TNT and other high explosives. overnight as outside temperatures fell below freezing. The next morning the worker returned to Booster Room 2. He probably assumed that the pot had been emptied, and without checking its contents he turned on the motor to the agitator blades, setting off the initial explosion. Using metallurgical analysis, CSB investigators determined that the heavy mixer blade had probably become embedded in the hardened explosive. Investigators theorized that as the blade started to turn, it either struck or pinched the explosive material, causing it to detonate. Another possibility is that the explosive contained a foreign metal object, which initiated the blast by scraping along the inside of the pot. Indeed, survivors reported that Sierra's raw materials - which were purchased as demilitarized munitions from the U.S. Department of Defense - frequently contained foreign metal objects like nuts and bolts. Because the reclaimed explosives were not screened prior to use, metal objects commonly found their way into the mixing pots. The shock wave from the initial blast detonated several thousand pounds of explosives stored inside the booster room. Heavy debris from this explosion likely rained down onto the PETN drying building 220 feet away, piercing the roof or skylight and initiating an even larger secondary explosion, the CSB concluded.  ... The CSB's investigation revealed a lack of adherence to various process safety principles at Sierra Chemical. No workers from the Kean Canyon plant were involved in conducting the company's process hazard analysis for the booster operation, and the scope of that analysis did not extend to Booster Room 2. Plant managers did not understand the hazards of the materials in use  -  incorrectly believing that they were almost impossible to detonate without using a blasting cap. Raw materials, equipment, and work procedures were altered without an analysis of the hazards of these changes. Workers in both booster rooms used practices that have long been recognized as hazardous at military explosives facilities. Workers regularly used metal tools, including steel hammers and rods, to break up rejected explosive boosters or to clear out pipes and valves that were blocked with explosives despite the hazard of an accidental detonation. None of the operators at Kean Canyon recalled seeing any written operating procedures. Without written procedures, training was conducted in an informal, on-the-job manner, relying upon physical demonstration and word of mouth. Work procedures varied among different operators. For example, CSB's interviews showed that while the normal practice was to check the mixing pots for residual material before starting the motors, not all workers did so. ... Based on guidelines from the Institute of Makers of Explosives, the two booster rooms should have been located at least 245 to 295 feet from the PETN drying building. The actual distances ranged from 185 to 220 feet. The two booster rooms should have been sited at least 490 feet apart, but the actual distance between them was just 80 feet. Department of Defense guidelines cited by the CSB recommend that explosive operations be separated from extraneous work activities by at least 1,250 feet. But at Sierra the production buildings had multiple uses, including unrelated mixing, packaging, and administrative operations. In fact, one of the workers killed was involved in nonexplosive- related activities outside Booster Room 2. Building construction was also deficient. For example, the PETN building should not have had a skylight, which could be penetrated by explosion debris. The production buildings should not have been constructed from concrete blocks, which can fragment in an explosion to form potentially lethal projectiles.",

The Brunner Mond Chemical factory was in the Silvertown area. It had originally produced caustic soda. After the outbreak of the war and with pressure from the government it switched production in 1915 to TNT, despite the fact it was in a heavily built up area. So in 1917 the factory was producing TNT for use in high explosive bombs. On the night of 19th January 1917 the factory exploded at 6.52 pm. It is believed the explosion was caused by a fire in the \"melt pot\" room. The explosion was heard 100 miles away. It devastated the area and damaged thousands of homes. The factory itself, the local fire station and other local factories were completely destroyed. 69 people died in the explosion with 4 others dying later. The death toll might have been much worse. The time of the explosion meant that many workers had already finished their days work.",

But it was too late to enter: the anti-submarine nets had been closed for the night. Mont-Blanc's captain Aime Le Medec had to stay at sea for one more night.  Inside the nets, in Bedford Basin, the Belgian relief ship Imo waited to head out in the morning. ... At around 7:30 am on December 6 the navy opened the gate in the nets at the entrance to the harbor. Mont-Blanc was the second of several vessels headed up the harbor ... . Around the same time, Imo raised anchor in Bedford Basin. Then it headed toward the Narrows. ... At about 8:45, Imo's prow struck the starboard bow of Mont-Blanc. It missed the hold carrying TNT but hit areas carrying the benzol fuel...and the highly unstable picric acid. As the two steel vessels ground into each other, sparks flew.  Witnesses said that at first, they saw a tendril of smoke coming out of a gash in the Mont-Blanc's hull. The fire started almost immediately and grew rapidly. A huge cloud of oily black smoke enveloped the deck. Mont-Blanc's crew abandoned ship. ... The blazing ship drifted in to the Halifax shoreline, up to Pier 6, and the fire spread to the pier's wooden pilings. ... On land, the collision and the spectacular fire drew crowds of spectators on both sides of the harbor. ... At 9:04:35 Mont-Blanc exploded with a force stronger than any manmade explosion before it. The steel hull burst sky-high, falling in a blizzard of red-hot, twisted projectiles on Dartmouth and Halifax.  Some pieces were tiny; others were huge. Part of the anchor hit the ground more than 4 kilometers away on the far side of Northwest Arm. A gun barrel landed in Dartmouth more than 5 kilometers from the harbor. ... The explosion sent a white cloud billowing 20,000 feet above the city.  For almost two square kilometers around Pier 6, nothing was left standing. The blast obliterated most of Richmond: its homes, apartments and even the towering sugar refinery. On the Dartmouth side, Tuft's Cove took the brunt of the blast. The small Mikmaq settlement of Turtle Grove was obliterated.  More than 1500 people were killed outright; hundreds more would die in the hours and days to come. Nine thousand people, many of whom might have been safe if they hadn't come to watch the fire, were injured by the blast, falling buildings and flying shards of glass. ... Within minutes the dazed survivors were awash in water. The blast provoked a tsunami that washed up as high as 18 meters above the harbor's high-water mark on the Halifax side. ...  The tsunami lifted Imo onto the Dartmouth shore. The ship stayed there until spring.",

Between 1860 and 1880, Black Tom was connected to the mainland by a causeway and rail lines terminating at a freight facility with docks. The area between the island and the mainland was filled in sometime between 1905 and 1916 by the Lehigh Valley Railroad as part of its Jersey City facility. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Black Tom was serving as a major munitions depot.  Before the United States entered the First World War, American businessmen would sell their supplies to any buyer. However, by 1915, the British Navy had established a blockade effectively keeping the Germans from being able to buy from the American merchants. The German government, on July 30, 1916, orchestrated the sabotage of freight cars at Black Tom, which were loaded with munitions for the Allies in Europe.  According to a recent study, the resulting explosion was the equivalent of an earthquake measuring between 5.0 and 5.5 on the Richter Scale. Windows within a 25-mile radius were broken, the outside wall of Jersey City's City Hall was cracked and pieces of metal damaged the skirt of the Statue of Liberty (it is because of this explosion that the Lady's torch has been closed off to visitors). Most of the immigrants on Ellis Island were temporarily evacuated. Losses were estimate at $20 million and seven people were killed.  After the war, a commission appointed to resolve American claims against Germany was established. It took years before a decision was made, finally in June of 1939, the commission ruled that the German Government had authorized the sabotage. However, World War II interrupted any chances of arranging for restitution. In 1953 the two governments finally settled on terms that the German government would pay a total of $95 million for a number of claims including Black Tom. The final payment was received in 1979."

It binds to the P450 reductase domain of the eNOS and suppresses l-citrulline formation by shunting electrons away from the normal catalytic pathway. The reduction of TNT then produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide (O2.\u2212), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The overproduction of superoxide is associated with oxidative stress-mediated induction of cataracts. The inhibition of the eNOS activity occurs in a concentration-dependent manner. (A110, A111)",

The ratio of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) in the LAP mixture in this study was 1.6:1. Acute oral toxicity of the LAP mixture was investigated in rats, mice, and rabbits. The results indicate that there was a distinct species difference regarding acute oral toxicity after exposure to the LAP mixture. The acute oral LD50 values indicate that rats were more susceptible to toxic effects of the LAP mixture than to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene alone. The opposite was true for mice ... LAP applied to the eyes of rabbits produced conjunctivitis, iritis, and/or corneal opacity. Intermediate oral toxicity was determined in a 90-day exposure study in rats, mice, and dogs. The results indicate that the main target organs for LAP toxicity are the same as those for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, namely blood and liver. Mild-to-moderate hemolytic anemia, enlarged spleens and livers, hemosiderosis of the spleen, and colored urine were common effects of intermediate exposure to LAP seen in all three species. LAP-induced testicular atrophy (dogs and rats), uterine hypoplasia (rats), and numerous neurological signs (dogs) were also observed. These observations indicate that 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene was the principal, but not the only factor, contributing to the intermediate oral toxicity of LAP; some of the observed toxicity is due to RDX .",

It is therefore essential to have fast and reliable methods to monitor human exposure. ... Hemoglobin (Hb) adducts of TNT are markers for the internal dose and possibly for the toxic effects of TNT, e.g. cataracts. In the present paper /the authors/ introduce a new efficient method to quantify Hb adducts of TNT. Precipitated Hb was hydrolyzed with base in the presence of the surrogate internal standard 3,5-dinitroaniline (35DNA). The released 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2ADNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4ADNT) were quantified against 35DNA by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with negative-ion chemical ionization. Hb of 50 workers and controls from a Chinese munition factory were investigated. The Hb adduct levels ranged from 3.7 to 522 ng for 4ADNT and from 0 to 14.7 ng for 2ADNT per gram of Hb. However, in control samples from Germany no Hb adducts of 4ADNT or 2ADNT could be found.",

Susceptibility seemed greater among workers with direct manual contact with the agent, especially those with grease on the skin. Women seem far more susceptible than men. ... Clinical features were those of acute or subactue hepatic necrosis. Onset of illness was usually delayed for 1 to 4 months (at times even longer) from initial exposure. ... In some instances illness did not appear until days or weeks after cessation of exposure to TNT.",

In this study, /the authors/ examine the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and blood pressure value following TNT exposure. With a crude enzyme preparation, /it was/ found that TNT inhibited the enzyme activity of eNOS in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 value = 49.4 uM). With an intraperitoneal administration of TNT (10 and 30 mg/kg) to rats, systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated 1 hr after TNT exposure (1.2- and 1.3-fold of that of the control, respectively). Under the conditions, however, experiments with the inducible NOS inhibitor aminoguanidine revealed that an adaptive response against hypertension caused by TNT occurs. These results suggest that TNT is an environmental chemical that acts as an uncoupler of constitutive NOS isozymes, resulting in decreased nitric oxide formation associated with hypertension in rats.",

To evaluate risk to avian receptors, measures of exposure are compared with a threshold level of sublethal toxicity. To date, a single feeding study has evaluated the responses of oral TNT exposure to birds with equivocal results regarding sublethal effects. The present study followed a controlled dosing regime comprising four dose groups and a control (200, 120, 70, 20, and 0 mg TNT/kg body weight-day) in the common pigeon (Columba livia) for 60 days. Overt signs of toxicity occurred with both sexes between 2 and 3 weeks of exposure. Signs included weight loss, neuromuscular effects (e.g., ataxia, tremors, etc.), and scant red feces (chromaturia). Emetic events following dosing were common and proportional to dose; however, attempts to quantify vomitus compound concentration suggests that birds were marginally successful at removing TNT following administration. Eight of 12 and 2 of 12 males and females died or were moribund in the 200 and 120 mg/kg-day groups, respectively. Changes in hematological parameters, liver, kidney, and ovary weights were related to treatment. Dose-related changes in plasma albumin and sodium concentrations were also observed. These results suggest that subchronic exposure to TNT can adversely affect the central nervous system and hematological parameters in birds. Chemical analysis of blood detected concentrations of the two primary reduction metabolites, but not parent compound, suggesting that toxicity may be due to the bioaccumulation of a toxic intermediate.",

Adult male and female quail (n = 5/sex/dose) were given commercial feed containing 3,000, 1,500, 750, and 100 mg/kg TNT for 90 days following the determination of an acute lethal dose and a 14-day range finding study. Dietary TNT intake caused a dose-dependent decrease in total red blood cell counts, packed cell volume, total plasma protein, blood prolymphocytes, and blood lymphocytes. An increased trend in late apoptotic/necrotic blood leukocytic cells was also observed in TNT-exposed birds, as was hemosiderosis in the liver. With the exception of hemosiderosis, these trends were statistically significant yet of questionable biological significance. Since treatment-related responses in this preliminary study were variable, a conservative interpretation is suggested. However, since these treatments had concentrations that were a log-fold or more than doses in similar studies using mammals, these data suggest that northern bobwhite are less sensitive to oral exposures of TNT than mammals.",

The TNT (96-hr LC50 = 16.7 uM) was more lethal than 2ADNT (96-hr LC50 = 166 uM) or 4ADNT (96-hr LC50 = 115 uM). Although 4ADNT (96-hr EC50 = 85.8 uM) induced various tadpole malformations, it was a weak teratogen compared with TNT (96-hr EC50 = 9.78 microM) and 2ADNT (96-hr EC50 = 16.9 microM). The most typical malformations observed were axial malformations, eye abnormalities (TNT), edema, and irregular gut coiling (2ADNT and 4ADNT). The 96-hr LC50 and 96-hr EC50 values of TNT, 2ADNT, and 4ADNT were lower than their saturated concentrations in water. Therefore, these nitroaromatic compounds may show lethal or teratogenic effects on aquatic animals if their habitats are severely contaminated with TNT.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 8.02X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 120 days. Particulate-phase 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. The rate constants for river water, freshwater bay, pond water and distilled water were 1.2X10-3, 1.5X10-4, 5.8X10-4 and 1.7X10-5/sec, respectively, which correspond to half-lives of about 10 min, 1.3 hrs, 20 min and 11.3 hrs. If released to soil, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is expected to have low mobility based upon an average Koc of 1,600. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Ultimate biodegradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene in soil will be of minor importance; however 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is readily reduced under anaerobic conditions. If released into water, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. The capability of microorganisms to biotransform 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene under aerobic conditions is very slow. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Gas chromatography-electron capture measurements demonstrated that a sea water solution at a pH of 8.1 with 95 ppm 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene underwent no change in concn after 108 days, thus evidencing the stability of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene against hydrolysis in water under neutral conditions. Occupational exposure may be possible through inhalation and dermal contact at sites of its manufacture and use as a military explosive and propellant. Monitoring data indicate that the general population will not likely be exposed to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene because it is mainly found at military facilities. (SRC)",

Volatilization of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure of 8.02X10-6 mm Hg(3) and water solubility of 115 mg/L(4). 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(3). Biodegradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene in soil will be of minor importance; however 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is readily reduced under anaerobic conditions(5). Microbial transformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene leads to a variety of reduction products, including 2-amino and 4-amino dinitrotoluene and azoxydimers(3,5,7). Limited information regarding photolytic processes in soil suggest that 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene in surface layers is photolyzed to trinitrobenzene and trinitrobenzaldehyde(8). Gas chromatography-electron capture measurements demonstrated that a sea water solution at a pH of 8.1 with 95 ppm 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene underwent no change in concn after 108 days(7), thus evidencing the stability of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene against hydrolysis in water under neutral conditions(9).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure of 8.02X10-6 mm Hg(4) and water solubility of 115 mg/L(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3.4(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.60(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). The capability of microorganisms to biotransform 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene seems well established(2,9-11); however, reduction rates under aerobic conditions are very slow. Photolysis studies comparing river waters and distilled water have shown that the rate of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene photolysis is directly related to increases in pH(10-11) and organic matter content(2). In the presence of oxygen, 10 ppm of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene added to a freshwater bay sample remained unchanged for 20 days then following first order kinetics with an estimated half-life of 25 days and dropped to 3 ppm within 64 days(2). 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene at an initial concn of 20 ppm within the dark control bottle of a river die away study underwent a 90% reduction within 30 days(11). However biotransformation was identified to be 100-1000 times slower than photolytic processes(2,11). Gas chromatography-electron capture measurements demonstrated that a sea water solution at a pH of 8.1 with 95 ppm 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene underwent no change in concn after 108 days(12), thus evidencing the stability of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene against hydrolysis in water under neutral conditions(13).",

Vapor-phase 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 120 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.4X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). The rate constants for river water, seawater, pond water and distilled water were 1.2X10-3, 1.5X10-4, 5.8X10-4 and 1.7X10-5/sec, respectively, which correspond to half-lives of about 10 min, 1.3 hrs, 20 min and 11.3 hrs(4).",

A treatability study employing static tube runs indicated that 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene can be oxidized at slow rates from 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene waste diluted with the domestic waste of an Army Ammunition plant; however, the rate of bioadsorption or bioprecipitation was greater than the oxidation rate(2). Activated sludge acclimated to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene waste for 10 days was used as inoculum for five differing continuous flow runs with 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene concn at 5 mg intervals between 5 and 25 mg/L(2). Fifteen treatability runs of three differing detention times for each concn maintained a 65% average removal efficiency and generally the removal efficiencies tended to decrease with a decrease in detention time and increase in 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene concn(2). A portion of the 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene loss was due to bioadsorption on the activated sludge microorganisms and not due to molecular transformation(3). Composting studies have shown that thermophilic microorganisms produce the same reduction products as mesophilic microbes, no ring cleavage occurs and a large percentage of C14 labeled 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is bound to the humus fraction(4-6). BOD tests on pure 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene waste water from the counter current-continuous flow TNT manufacturing process revealed that 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene was oxidized at slow rates(7-8). Attempts to relate BOD to the 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene removed were unsuccessful. It is likely that higher 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene concentrations are toxic to certain oxidizing microorganisms, which may prevent microbial metabolism of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene(3). Raw sewage was found to be ineffective in degrading 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, however a sewage sludge digester supernatant liquor caused a 64% reduction in 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene within 6 days(9).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 120 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Gas chromatography-electron capture measurements demonstrated that a sea water solution at a pH of 8.1 with 95 ppm 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene underwent no change in concn after 108 days(2), thus evidencing the stability of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene against hydrolysis in water under neutral conditions(3). Generally nitro-aromatics are resistant to hydrolysis(4,5) and thus a 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions(3,6).",

The photolytic rate of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene also increased over time due to increased products of photolysis(4). The rate constants for sunlit Holston River (Kinsport, TN; near munitions facility), Waconda Bay (Chattanooga, TN; near munitions facility), Searsville Pond (Stanford, CA; eutrophic, high in humc and fulvic material, free of munitions contamination) and distilled waters were 1.2X10-3, 1.5X10-4, 5.8X10-4 and 1.7X10-5/sec, respectively, which correspond to half-lives of about 10 min, 1.3 hrs, 20 min and 11.3 hrs(1). 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene was reduced using Fe2+, the rate of reduction increased as the pH was increased over the tested pHs of 6, 7, and 8(5). 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene was reduced 77-85% in 30-40 hours using iron-reducing conditions(6). First order photodegradation rates were given for August as 0.3/hr and for December as 1.0/hr at UV irradiance rates receiving 1.3X10-3 watts/sq cm and 2.4X10-6 watts/sq cm, respectively(7).",

The principal evidence suggests transformation via a triplet-sensitized mechanism(2,3,4) which either permits a weak nucleophile to attack and remove a NO2- or X- group(3), or allows the formation of a complex with humic acid that alters the UV absorbancies responsible for the photodegradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene(2).

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

However most of the material absorbed is strongly bound and desorption from sediment is slow(1). Furthermore sorption of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene increases with increases in pH and temperature(1). Transformation products of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene may absorb to sediments with the same intensity as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene(1). Kp values of 5 sediments averaged 53 with a range between 35 and 84(2). According to a classification scheme(3), the corresponding Koc values, which range between 1,100 and 1,900 and average 1,600(2), suggest that 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is expected to have low mobility in soil. A Kd value of 3.3 L/kg was given for soil from Nebraska Ordinance Plant(4). An average Kd value of 4.0 was determined in 14 different soils(5). Mobility of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene was enhanced with strong hydrated(Na+, Ca+) or diminished with weakly hydrated (K+) cations(6). 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluenes affinity for phyllosilicates (Kl = 0.496 L/umol) may displace other nitroaromatic compounds effecting its transport through the soil(7). Sorption coefficients for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene were given in topsoil samples as 6.38 L/kg and in illite as 223.63 L/kg(8). Desorption coefficients for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene were given for topsoil as 12.01 L/kg and 265.98 L/kg in illite(8). Soil (pH 6.5, 5.3% clay, 1.7% organic matter) containing 11 mg/kg dry soil weight of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene gave a Kd of 2.9 L/kg and average diffusion rate of 1.18X10-6 cu cm/sec, indicating slow transportation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene through the soil(9).",

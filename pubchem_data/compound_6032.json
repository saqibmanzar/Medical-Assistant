Derived from Streptomyces kanamyceticus, kanamycin is an antibiotic complex consisting of three components: kanamycin A, the major component (also usually designated as kanamycin), and kanamycins B and C, the minor components. This agent irreversibly binds to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Specifically, this antibiotic is lodged between 16S rRNA and S12 protein within the 30S subunit. This leads to interference with translational initiation complex, misreading of mRNA, thereby hampering protein synthesis and resulting in bactericidal effect. Aminoglycosides are mostly ineffective against anaerobic bacteria, fungi and viruses.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

As with other aminoglycosides, the major toxic effects of kanamycin are its action on the auditory and vestibular branches of the eighth nerve and the renal tubules. Neurotoxicity is manifested by bilateral auditory toxicity which often is permanent and, sometimes, by vestibular ototoxicity. Loss of high frequency perception usually occurs before there is noticeable clinical hearing loss and can be detected by audiometric testing.  There may not be clinical symptoms to warn of developing cochlear damage.  Vertigo may occur and may be evidence of vestibular injury. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of hearing loss increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations and continues to progress after drug withdrawal.   Renal impairment may be characterized by decreased creatinine clearance, the presence of cells or casts, oliguria, proteinuria, decreased urine specific gravity, or evidence of increasing nitrogen retention (increasing BUN, NPN, or serum creatinine).    The risks of severe ototoxic and nephrotoxic reactions are sharply increased in patients with impaired renal function and in those with normal renal function who receive high doses or prolonged therapy.    Renal and eighth nerve function should be closely monitored, especially in patients with known or suspected reduced renal function at the onset of therapy, and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy.  Serum concentrations of parenterally administered aminoglycosides should be monitored when feasible to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels.  Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity, increased excretion of protein, and the presence of cells or casts.  Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, or creatinine clearance should be measured periodically.  Serial audiograms should be obtained when feasible in patients old enough to be tested; particularly high risk patients. Evidence of ototoxicity (dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss) or nephrotoxicity requires dosage adjustment or discontinuance of the drug. Neuromuscular blockade with respiratory paralysis may occur when kanamycin is instilled intraperitoneally concomitantly with anesthesia and muscle-relaxing drugs. Neuromuscular blockade has been reported following parenteral injection and the oral use of aminoglycosides.  The possibility of the occurrence of neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis should be considered if aminoglycosides are administered by any route, especially in patients receiving anesthetics, neuromuscular-blocking agents such as tubocurarine, succinylcholine, decamethonium, or in patients receiving massive transfusions of citrate-anticoagulated blood.  If blockage occurs, calcium salts may reduce these phenomena but mechanical respiratory assistance may be necessary. The concurrent and/or sequential systemic, oral, or topical use of kanamycin and other potentially nephrotoxic, and/or neurotoxic drugs, particularly polymyxin B, bacitracin, colistin, amphotericin B, cisplatin, vancomycin, and all other aminoglycosides (including paromomycin) should be avoided because the toxicity may be additive. Other factors which may increase patient risk of toxicity are advanced age and dehydration.   Kanamycin should not be given concurrently with potent diuretics (ethacrynic acid, furosemide, meralluride sodium, sodium mercaptomerin, or mannitol).  Some diuretics themselves cause ototoxicity, and intravenously administered diuretics may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue.",

Aminoglycosides work by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, causing misreading of t-RNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth. Aminoglycosides are useful primarily in infections involving aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter. In addition, some mycobacteria, including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, are susceptible to aminoglycosides. Infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria can also be treated with aminoglycosides, but other types of antibiotics are more potent and less damaging to the host. In the past the aminoglycosides have been used in conjunction with penicillin-related antibiotics in streptococcal infections for their synergistic effects, particularly in endocarditis. Aminoglycosides are mostly ineffective against anaerobic bacteria, fungi and viruses.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Kanamycin injection is indicated in the short-term treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms. Kanamycin may be considered as initial therapy in the treatment of infections where one or more of the following are the known or suspected pathogens: E. coli, Proteus species (both indole-positive and indole-negative), Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter species. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Toxic effects of kanamycin on the eighth cranial nerve can result in partially reversible or irreversible bilateral loss of hearing, loss of balance, or both.  Tinnitus or vertigo may or may not be experienced.  Cochlear damage is usually manifested initially by small changes in audiometric test results at the high frequencies and may not be associated with subjective hearing loss.  Vestibular dysfunction is usually manifested by nystagmus, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, or acute Meniere's syndrome. Serious sensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported rarely in patients receiving aminoglycosides; fatalities have occurred rarely. Cross-sensitivity occurs among the aminoglycosides. ANIMAL STUDIES: Intravitreal injection in rabbits and owl monkeys was tolerated at a dose of 0.5 mg, but 1.5 to 6.0 mg produced cataracts in rabbits. Dosages of 200 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats and pregnant guinea pigs led to hearing impairment in the offspring.",

Newborn infants apparently absorb small amounts of other aminoglycosides, but serum levels with typical three times daily dosages are far below those attained when treating newborn infections and systemic effects of kanamycin are unlikely. Older infants would be expected to absorb even less kanamycin. Because there is little variability in the milk kanamycin levels during multiple daily dose regimens, timing breastfeeding with respect to the dose is of little or no benefit in reducing infant exposure. Data are not available with single daily dose regimens. Monitor the infant for possible effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (e.g., thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis.",

The synergistic effect of aminoglycosides and beta-lactams is used to therapeutic advantage, especially in the treatment of infections caused by enterococci or Ps. aeruginosa. Although the exact mechanism of this synergistic effect has not been determined, it appears that by inhibiting bacterial cell-wall synthesis the penicillin allows more effective ingress of the aminoglycoside to the ribosomal binding site. Synergism between aminoglycosides and extended-spectrum penicillins generally is unpredictable and antagonism has been reported rarely in vitro when these penicillins were used in conjunction with amikacin, gentamicin, or tobramycin. Therefore, some clinicians suggest that when concomitant therapy is indicated it may be advisable to use appropriate in vitro studies to demonstrate synergism against the isolated organism. Concomitant administration of an extended-spectrum penicillin and an aminoglycoside has resulted in decreased serum aminoglycoside concentrations and elimination half life, especially in patients with renal impairment. Therefore, serum aminoglycoside concentrations should be monitored in patients receiving concomitant therapy, especially when very high doses of an extended-spectrum penicillin are used or when the patient has impaired renal function. /Aminoglycosides/",

Their protracted use in MDR-TB treatment is known to cause dose-dependent irreversible hearing loss, requiring hearing aids, cochlear implants or rehabilitation. Therapeutic drug monitoring and regular audiological assessments may help to prevent or detect the onset of hearing loss, but these services are not always available or affordable in many developing countries. We aimed to compare the cumulative incidence of hearing loss among patients treated for MDR-TB with amikacin or kanamycin-based regimens, and to identify the most-at-risk patients, based on the real-life clinical practice experiences in Namibia. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients treated with amikacin or kanamycin-based regimens in four public sector MDR-TB treatment sites in Namibia between June 2004 and March 2014. Patients were audiologically assessed as part of clinical care. The study outcome was the occurrence of any hearing loss. Data were manually extracted from patients' treatment records. We compared proportions using the Chi-square test; applied stratified analysis and logistic regression to study the risk of hearing loss and to identify the most-at-risk patients through effect-modification analysis. A P-value<0.05 was statistically significant. All 353 patients had normal baseline hearing, 46% were HIV co-infected. Cumulative incidence of any hearing loss was 58%, which was mostly bilateral (83%), and mild (32%), moderate (23%), moderate-severe (1%), severe (10%), or profound (15%). Patients using amikacin had a greater risk of developing the more severe forms of hearing loss than those using kanamycin (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=4.0, 95 % CI: 1.5-10.8). Patients co-infected with HIV (OR=3.4, 95 % CI: 1.1-10.6), males (OR=4.5, 95 %1.5-13.4) and those with lower baseline body weight (40-59 kg, OR=2.8, 95 % CI: 1.1-6.8), were most-at-risk of developing hearing loss. Amikacin use in the long-term MDR-TB treatment led to a higher risk of occurrence of the more severe forms of hearing loss compared to kanamycin use. Males, patients with low baseline body weight and those co-infected with HIV were most-at-risk. MDR-TB treatment programs should consider replacing amikacin with kanamycin and strengthen the routine renal, serum therapeutic drug levels and audiometric monitoring in the most-at-risk patients treated with aminoglycosides.",

Assessment of vestibular hair cells was performed by Nomarski (differential interference contrast) microscopy. Hair cell counts were expressed as densities (number of cells per 0.01 sq mm surface area of the sensory epithelium). The results were compared with age-matched normal data. Streptomycin caused a significant loss of both type I and type II hair cells in all 5 vestibular sense organs. In comparing the ototoxic effect on type I versus type II hair cells, there was greater type I hair cell loss for all 3 cristae, but not for the maculae. The vestibular ototoxic effects of kanamycin appeared to be similar to those of streptomycin, but the small sample size precluded definitive conclusions from being made. Neomycin did not cause loss of vestibular hair cells. Within the limits of this study (maximum postototoxicity survival time of 12 months), there was no significant loss of Scarpa's ganglion cells for any of the 3 drugs. The findings have implications in several clinical areas, including the correlation of vestibular test results to pathological findings, the rehabilitation of patients with vestibular ototoxicity, the use of aminoglycosides to treat Meniere's disease, and the development of a vestibular prosthesis.",

Growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP6) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have proven cytoprotective effects in various tissues, including the kidney. This study aimed to determine the cytoprotective effect of EGF and GHRP6 on glomerular, proximal tubular, and interstitial morphology in rats treated with an overdose of kanamycin. Forty-four male Wistar adults rats were submitted to treatment for 20 days with sodium phosphate saline buffer (control group), kanamycin (kanamycin group), kanamycin and EGF (EGF group), kanamycin and GHRP6 (GHRP6 group), kanamycin, EGF, and GHRP6 (EGF-GHRP6 group). The kidneys were studied both during acute kidney injury (n = 19) and recovery phases (n = 25). The percentages of glomerular damage, tubular damage (reversible and irreversible changes), and interstitial damage were quantified in 10 histological fields per kidney using paraffin-embedded sections. The damage in the glomeruli, proximal tubules, and interstitium was less in the groups treated with the cytoprotective treatments than in kanamycin group during acute kidney injury. During the recovery phase, normal structure of several glomeruli and the interstitium was appreciated in the EGF and GHRP6 groups, although tissue repair was not as complete as it in the EGF-GHRP6 group. In the recovery phase, cytoprotective treatments accelerated the recovery of tubular damage and reversible tubular changes prevailed. These results confirm the cytoprotective properties of EGF and GHRP6 alone and in combination and suggest the possibility of using these agents to accelerate kidney tissue repair after aminoglycoside-induced renal damage.",

Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats (6-7 weeks old) were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. The animals in the experimental group were injected subcutaneously with KM (500 mg/kg per day) for two weeks, and the control group received equal volume of normal saline. To assess the ototoxicity of KM, the auditory brainstem response (ABR) was recorded to monitor the changes in hearing thresholds, and the density of spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) and morphology of cochlea were observed using surface preparations and frozen sections of cochlea. The results showed that the hearing threshold of rats in the experimental group was elevated by more than 60 dB across all the frequencies two weeks after the first administration of KM. And in the experimental group, the density of SGCs became lower, and organ of Corti suffered loss of hair cells. The loss of outer hair cells (OHCs) was more severe than that of inner hair cells (IHCs), correlated with the density decrease of SGCs. We conclude that the ototoxicity of KM in the adult rats was apparent and the underlying mechanism is associated with the loss of SGCs and hair cells.",

Guinea pigs were treated with kanamycin sulfate by subcutaneous injection at dose of 500 mg/kg/day for 7 days. Ultrastructural changes in FC and AN/FC synapse were observed, and local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mRNA was quantified using quantitative real time PCR at 1, 7, 14, 28, 70 and 140 days after kanamycin treatment. The average threshold was 46.46+/-3.45, 80.63+/-5.95 and 103.95+/-6.59 dB SPL respectively at 1, 7 and 14 days, and the threshold was statistically unchanged at 28, 70 and 140 days in comparison with the 14 day group. Mitochondrial swelling in FC and at AN/FC synapse was progressive at 7, 14 and 28 days. Moreover, the thickness of the postsynaptic densities increased at 1, 7 and 14 days. Finally, there was a persistent upregulation in local IGF-1 mRNA at 7, 14, 28 and 70 days. These changes in the ultrastructure of AN/FC synapse and FC, and upregulation of local IGF-1 mRNA were no longer present at 140 days. Our results indicate that the effects of kanamycin on the ultrastructure of FC and AN/FC synapse are progressive. However, FC and AN/FC synapse are capable of reviving and remodeling after kanamycin-induced lesion and incomplete deafferentation. Additionally, local IGF-1 might play a role in the lesion- and deafness-induced plasticity in FC and at AN/FC synapse following chronic kanamycin-induced deafness.",

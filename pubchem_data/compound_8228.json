ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Immediate side effects have not been reported and a limited amount of follow-up has found no adverse effects on infant growth and development. Imipramine use during breastfeeding would usually not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants, especially if the infant is older than 2 months. A safety scoring system finds imipramine use to be possible during breastfeeding. Some experts consider imipramine one of the antidepressants of choice for nursing mothers. However, other agents may be preferred when large doses are required or while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.",

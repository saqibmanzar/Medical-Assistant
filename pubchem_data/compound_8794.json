ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Headache, vertigo (dizziness), agitation, and giddiness may be followed by combative behavior, convulsions, paralysis, protruding eyeballs, dilated and unreactive pupils, and coma. Tachypnea (rapid, shallow respirations) or hyperpnea (rapid, deep respirations) may be followed by respiratory depression. Lung hemorrhage and pulmonary edema may also occur. Benzyl cyanide is irritating to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Lacrimation (tearing) and a burning sensation of the mouth and throat are common. Salivation, nausea, and vomiting may also occur.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

As a component of tar creosote benzyl cyanide is released to the environment through various waste streams. Benzyl cyanide has been found in kiwi fruit flowers, and garden cress and other plants. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.089 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzyl cyanide will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzyl cyanide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.8 days. Benzyl cyanide does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and would not be expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzyl cyanide is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 170. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Benzyl cyanide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using a Japanese MITI test benzyl cyanide, reached 77% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks, indicating that the biodegradation of benzyl cyanide is rapid. If released into water, benzyl cyanide is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.7 hours and 6.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis of the nitrile group may occur although the rate of this reaction is not known. Occupational exposure to benzyl cyanide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzyl cyanide is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzyl cyanide via ingestion of certain foods and contaminated drinking water. (SRC)",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

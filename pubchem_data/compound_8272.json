When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

All dyes were dissolved and diluted using balanced salt solution (BSS plus). After triamcinolone-assisted vitrectomy on 10 porcine eyes in vivo, the dyes were first injected into the air-filled vitreous cavity. After 1 minute, the dye was removed by irrigation with BSS, and the staining effect was graded by two examiners. After vitrectomy, the same dyes and concentrations were injected in the air-filled anterior chamber to stain the lens capsule of the same eye. After surgery, the eyes were enucleated and underwent fixation for light and electron microscopy. ...  The lens capsule stained very well with E68 2%, CB 2% and 0.5%, and BPB 2%, 1%, and 0.2% but not with LGSF. No histologic abnormalities were seen after the application in any eye after dye injection. No dye-related complications occurred during surgery. ... Because BPB stained the retinal surface and lens capsule at a low concentration (0.2%) with no signs of toxicity, this dye seems to be the most promising candidate for application in humans.",

The plasma concentrations were found to decrease monoexponentially after all doses except the highest, where the decrease was biexponential. Although the disposition kinetics of I were apparently first-order at all doses, the half-life increased with increasing dose. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) increased disproportionately with increasing dose. The binding of I to rat plasma proteins, as determined by equilibrium dialysis, showed that the fraction bound (96%) remained constant in the concentration range of 10-300 micrograms/ml. Plasma concentrations were determined at time zero after intravenous administration and after a second dose administered 20 min later when plasma concentrations from the first dose were minimal. The apparent first-order elimination rate constant for the plasma concentration decline following the second dose was significantly less than after the first dose, indicating that the residual dye in the liver altered the elimination of I after the second dose. The fraction of the dose in the liver decreased with increasing dose, indicating a saturable uptake process. The biliary excretion profile reflected the uptake saturation that occurred in the liver and demonstrated that the biliary excretion of I depended on the amount present in the liver. When liver damage was induced by exposure to carbon tetrachloride, dye concentrations in the plasma, liver, and kidney increased markedly.",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

Safety concerns on these two dyes of interest have been raised. Consequently, a battery of genetic toxicology assays, including the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay, L5178Y TK+/- mouse lymphoma assay, mouse micronucleus test and mitotic recombination assay with yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D5, has been performed on each of the two dyes. The results of the evaluations indicate that both bromophenol blue and tetrabromophenol blue were not active and can be considered non-genotoxic for the three genetic endpoints assessed (gene mutation, chromosome aberrations and primary DNA damage). Genetic activities in some structurally related compounds of these dyes have been reported but may be attributed to the presence of mutagenic impurities rather than the compound itself.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.7X10-17 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bromophenol blue will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase bromophenol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Bromophenol blue has a maximum absorbance wavelength of 598 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, bromophenol blue is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.5X10+6. The pKa of bromophenol blue is 4.0, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Bromophenol blue has been found to be biodegraded by select fungi. If released into water, bromophenol blue is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The pKa indicates bromophenol blue will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 1.4X10+4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to bromophenol blue may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bromophenol blue is produced or used. Use data indicate exposure to the general population may be limited to vitreoretinal surgery patients. (SRC)",

Bromophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 2.7X10-17 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5).

A pKa of 4.0(3) indicates bromophenol blue will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 1.4X10+4(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 6.77(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Bromophenol blue is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(8). Bromophenol blue has been found to be biodegraded by select fungi(9).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Human lymphocytes were cultured for 4 hours at 37 degrees-C in the presence or absence of chemicals. Chemicals were diluted with dimethylsulfoxide and their final concentrations varied from 0.01 to 0.0001 molar solutions. The effect of chemicals on DNA synthesis was measured by tritiated thymidine uptake. Cell toxicity was measured by trypan blue staining. Effect of the rat liver metabolizing enzyme system (LMS on the chemicals was also studied. MEK, chloroform, and 1,2-DCP caused no toxic action. CME, n-hexane, 1,2-DBP, 1,3-DBP, 2,3-DBPRL, 1,2-DIE, TCE, and 1,4-DCB were toxic at the highest dose used when lymphocytes were grown in the absence of LMS activation. Cytotoxicity disappeared in the presence of LMS activation. EA, cyclohexane, cyclohexanone, and benzene showed lower toxicity. Only chemicals that maintained some degree of toxicity following LMS activation were 1,2-DCB and 1,3-DCB. CMME treated cultures grown in the presence of LMS activation caused DNA damage indicating that the chemical was metabolically activated.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.36 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,3-dibromopropane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,3-dibromopropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 days. If released to soil, 1,3-dibromopropane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 460. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.88X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilization of 1,3-dibromopropane from dry soil surfaces exists based upon its vapor pressure. No biodegradation data were located for 1,3-dibromopropane. If released into water, 1,3-dibromopropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 6 days, respectively. The hydrolysis half-life of 1,3-dibromopropane is about 48 days at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C. An estimated BCF of 13 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 1,3-dibromopropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,3-dibromopropane is produced or used. (SRC)",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 19 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 1,3-Dibromopropane is not expected to undergo direct photolysis in the environment since it does not contain functional groups that absorb light in the environmental UV spectrum(2). The hydrolysis half-life of 1,3-dibromopropane is about 48 days at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

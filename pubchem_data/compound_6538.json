PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

Phosphoric acid triesters were extracted from these materials with acetonitrile and methylene chloride. After n-hexane-acetonitrile partition, the extract was cleaned up by activated charcoal column chromatography, followed by extraction with concentrated sulfuric acid, washing with 0.5 N NaOH solution, and finally Florisil minicolumn chromatography. The purified extracts were analyzed with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. The separation on gas chromatography was good with 10% OV-1 on Chromosorb W experiments (AW-DMCS) and 5% FFAP on Gas Chrom Q. Throughout the present method, the recoveries of phosphoric acid triesters were in the range of 60-95%, and the detection limits (fish) were approximately 1-5 ug/kg.",

Experiments with different gases used to generate the negative-chemical-ionization plasma indicated that the ion at m/z 463 was a chloride adduca of a Cl6 molecule with a mass of 428 daltons. Negative-chemical-ionization mass measurement with ions from the iodoform mass spectrum used as reference peaks gave a mass of 427.882 daltons; C9H15PCl6 has a molecular weight of 427.883. Extraction of polyurethane foam with toluene produced an extract that consistently gave a negative-chemical-ionization spectrum containing an intense Cl7ion at m/z463. The component producing ion was isolated, and its proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum confirmed that it was tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate, a mutagenic flame retardant. The negative-chemical-ionization screening evidence suggests that this flame retardant or its isomer tris(2,3-dichloro-l-propyl)phosphate, or both, are absorbved into the body from formulations in which they are used as flame retardants. Remedial action seems indicated to reduce human exposure to these compunds.",

The benefits or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

Experiments with different gases used to generate the negative-chemical-ionization plasma indicated that the ion at m/z 463 was a chloride adduca of a Cl6 molecule with a mass of 428 daltons. Negative-chemical-ionization mass measurement with ions from the iodoform mass spectrum used as reference peaks gave a mass of 427.882 daltons; C9H15PCl6 has a molecular weight of 427.883. Extraction of polyurethane foam with toluene produced an extract that consistently gave a negative-chemical-ionization spectrum containing an intense Cl7ion at m/z463. The component producing ion was isolated, and its proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum confirmed that it was tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate, a mutagenic flame retardant. The negative-chemical-ionization screening evidence suggests that this flame retardant or its isomer tris(2,3-dichloro-l-propyl)phosphate, or both, are absorbed into the body from formulations in which they are used as flame retardants. Remedial action seems indicated to reduce human exposure to these compounds.",

Relationships with reproductive and thyroid hormone levels, as well as semen quality parameters, were assessed using crude and multivariable linear regression. TDCPP and TPP were detected in 96% and 98% of samples, respectively, with widely varying concentrations up to 1.8 mg/g. In models adjusted for age and body mass index, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in TDCPP was associated with a 3% [95% confidence interval (CI), 5% to 1%) decline in free thyroxine and a 17% (95% CI, 432%) increase in prolactin. There was a suggestive inverse association between TDCPP and free androgen index that became less evident in adjusted models. ...

Most of the test samples showed mutagenic activity in the strains TA100 and TA1535, but not in the strains TA98, TA1537 and TA1538. In general, the mutagenic activities of the phosphates obtained with S9 mix were greater than the activities obtained without S9 mix. Among the phosphates, several structure--activity relationships were found; i.e., (i) the bromoalkyl derivatives were more mutagenic than the corresponding chloroalkyl derivatives, (ii) the beta-haloethyl derivatives were more mutagenic than the gamma-halopropyl derivatives, (iii) the phosphates having adjacent beta and gamma halogen atoms in the alkyl moiety, e.g., tris-(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate, were particularly potent mutagens, (iv) the branched carbon chain reduced the mutagenic activities in spite of the presence of beta-halogen atoms, e.g., tris(1-bromomethyl-2-bromoethyl)phosphate. However, such relations did not necessarily apply to the halogenated alkanols. It is concluded that the metabolic activation pathway via haloalkanols to mutagens must not be in common with all tris-BP-like phosphates.",

Slc/ddY mice (12 male, 12 female per group) were administered diet containing 1.33, 0.42, 0.13, 0.04, and 0.01% of TDCPP for 3 months. Male and female mice of the 1.33% group showed emaciation, rough hair, and tremor; and all animals died within one month. Hematological studies showed slight anemia in males of the 0.42% group and females of the 0.42% and 0.13% groups. They also exhibited a tendency to increase ALP and GPT levels. The animals of the 0.42%, 0.13% and 0.04% groups exhibited tendency to increase liver weights and kidney weights in both sexes. Histopathologically, very slight focal necrosis was recognized in the liver in only 2 females of the 0.42% group. The NOEL under this condition is 0.01% in the diet of tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (male: 13.2 mg/kg/day, female: 15.3 mg/kg/day).",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.3X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tris(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tris(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours. Particulate-phase tris(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Tris(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tris(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 9700. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Tris(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on resistance to degradation by activated sludge. If released into water, tris(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 18 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Tris(haloalkyl) phosphates, such as tris(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate, are generally stable to hydrolysis at neutral pH and undergo moderate hydrolysis in acidic or basic solutions. Occupational exposure to tris(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tris(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate was produced or used.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.9X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21.3 hrs. Particulate-phase tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1100. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0-4% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. BCFs ranging from 0.3 to 113 suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Limited data suggest that tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate will be resistant to hydrolysis in most environmental waters. Occupational exposure to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate  may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing  tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 18(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 3.65(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Tris(haloalkyl) phosphates are generally stable to hydrolysis at neutral pH and undergo moderate hydrolysis in acidic or basic solutions(7). Biodegradation is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on resistance to degradation by activated sludge(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was detected in drinking water from six eastern Ontario municipal water treatment plants in 1978 at 0.2-1.8 ng/L(2). Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was detected in 14 of 29 municipal water supplies representing the major urban centers across Canada at 0.3-23.0 ng/L(3). Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was detected in drainage basins drinking water supplies at mean concentrations of 0.0 ng/L for the Pacific Sea Board and the Columbia, 0.1 ng/L for the Atlantic Sea Board, 1.7 ng/L at Lake Winnipeg, 2.4 ng/L at Great lakes, and 3.1 ng/L for the St. Lawrence River. Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was detected in the sources for these drainage basins at average levels of 3.7, 0.3, and 0.0 ng/L for rivers, lakes, and wells, respectively(3). Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was detected in surface water from the river Ruhr (Germany) used for a drinking water works at 8.6-18 ng/L, average 13 ng/L(4). Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was detected in the finished water after several purification steps at 1.2-2.4 ng/L, average 2.6 ng/L; elimination was attributed to activated carbon filtration as well as to a 10-15 day passage time through soil(4). Ozonization and multilayer filtration did not contribute to the removal of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate(4).",

Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was detected in 16.7% of 30 low-flow samples collected upstream and downstream of towns and cities in Iowa in 2001 at a maximum concentration of 0.4 ug/L; tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was not detected in any high-flow (n = 23) or normal-flow samples (n = 23) in the same study(2). Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was detected in 100% of 12 samples of stream and raw water for a drinking-water-treatment facility in a heavy populated, highly urbanized drainage basin in the United States at a 0.06-0.25 ug/L(3). Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was detected 2 of 6 agricultural runoff samples from fields irrigated with treated effluent in Ventura County, California in July 1999-April 2000(4). Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was detected in both polluted areas and less-polluted areas of the Yodo River (Japan) from 1976 to 1990 at ca. 0.1-0.9 ug/L and ca. 0-0.7 ug/L, respectively, with the concentration gradually increasing from 1976-1987 and decreasing from 1988-1990(5). Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate was detected in three volcanic lakes located in Central Italy from June 2006-June 2007. The mean monthly range of concentration at all three lakes was 2-60 ng/L with the maximum occurring during the late summer to autumn months. Due to their location, the lakes lack emissaries and tributaries and sewage treatment plant inputs. Therefore, contamination can occur only via local anthropogenic activities or long-range transport and deposition from rainfall or runoff processes(6).",

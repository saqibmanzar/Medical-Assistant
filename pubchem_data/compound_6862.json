When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The pattern applied whether bile was collected for 2 or 6 hr. The portion of /(14)C-NAA/ excreted in bile was greater than that excreted in feces suggesting that entero-hepatic circulation occurred thus, (14)C-compound excreted in bile were partly reabsorbed from intestines (after possible modification, such as deconjugation of conjugates) to be excreted by kidneys. Thus, naphthaleneacetic acid was rapidly and completely absorbed after oral dose to rats and its excretion was dose-dependent, but was rapid after lower doses.",

Measure direct- and indirect-reacting bilirubin in the plasma. Monitor fluid balance and blood electrolytes. If possible, monitor urinary excretion of naphthol to assess severity of poisoning and clinical progress. If hemolysis is clinically significnt, administer intravenous fluids to accelerate urinary excretion of the naphthol metabolite and protect the kidney from products of hemolysis. Use Ringer's-lactate or sodium bicarbonate to keep urine pH above 7.5. Consider use of mannitol, or furosemide, to promote diuresis. If urine flow declines, intravenous infusions must be carefully monitored to avoid fluid overload. Institute hemodialysis. Consider charcoal hemoperfusion in tandem to extract naphthalene and end-products. If anemia is severe, blood transfusions may be needed. Hydrocortisone may be of some benefit if significant hemolysis is present. /Fumigant poisoning/",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.6X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-naphthaleneacetic acid will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-naphthaleneacetic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 hrs. Particulate-phase 1-naphthaleneacetic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Photolysis may be an important environmental fate process in the atmosphere based upon aqueous photolysis data. If released to soil, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 390. The pKa of 1-naphthaleneacetic acid is 4.23, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in the dissociated form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because anions do not volatilize.  1-Naphthaleneacetic acid has a reported half-life in soil of 10 days, attributed to microbial degradation. If released into water, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A pKa of 4.23 indicates 1-naphthaleneacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the ionized form at pH values of 5 to 9 and anions do not volatilize. Biodegradation is not expected to be a fast environmental fate process in water based upon a 0% theoretical BOD using activated sludge and the MITI test. A BCF range of 0.5-4.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1-naphthaleneacetic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-naphthaleneacetic acid is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-naphthaleneacetic acid via inhalation of ingestion of contaminated fruits. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 1-naphthaleneacetic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.7X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase 1-naphthaleneacetic acid may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Photolysis may be an important environmental fate process in the atmosphere as indicated by the detection of photolysis products 1-naphthoic and phthalic acids during analysis of a sunlight exposed aqueous solution of 1-naphthaleneacetic acid(4,5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

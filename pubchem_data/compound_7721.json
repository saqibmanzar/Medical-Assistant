Physically it is a colourless liquid (melting point 21 \u00b0C) with a pleasant aromatic odour. p-Xylyl bromide is highly toxic, irritant and lachrymatory, and has been incorporated in chemical weapons since the early months of World War I. The first extensive use of xylyl bromide was the firing by German forces of 18,000 \"T-shells\" at Russian positions in the Battle of Bolim\u00f3w in January 1915. In the absence of clarification, the name \"xylyl bromide\" may refer to any one of 3 xylyl isomers (o-Xylyl, p-Xylyl, m-Xylyl) or a mixture of all three.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Its use in mixture with o- and m-isomers as a tear gas will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates p-xylyl bromide will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase p-xylyl bromide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.3 days. p-Xylyl bromide does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, p-xylyl bromide is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 710. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.6X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, due to a reported hydrolysis half-life of 4.3 minutes for p-xylyl bromide, adsorption, volatilization, and biodegradation are not expected to be important environmental fate processes in moist soil. p-Xylyl bromide may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, p-xylyl bromide is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hours and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 85 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. However, due to a reported hydrolysis half-life of 4.3 minutes at 25 \u00b0C for p-xylyl bromide, adsorption, volatilization, bioconcentration, and biodegradation are not expected to be important environmental fate processes in water. Occupational exposure to p-xylyl bromide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where p-xylyl bromide is produced or used. The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to p-xylyl bromide is by dermal contact and inhalation due to the release of this substance in tear gas. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 6 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 6 days(SRC). p-Xylyl bromide's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). However, a hydrolysis half-life of 4.3 minutes at 25 \u00b0C(3) will pre-empt volatilization from moist surfaces(SRC). p-Xylyl bromide is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 0.10 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(4).",

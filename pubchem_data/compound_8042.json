Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The first trial was a nonrandomized (proof of concept) trial without a comparator conducted in Winnipeg, Canada. The second trial, conducted in the United States, was an evaluator-blinded, randomized superiority trial comparing 50% IPM rinse with a positive control (RID; pyrethrin 0.33%, piperonyl butoxide 4%). The primary end points were to determine the safety and efficacy of 50% IPM as a pediculicide rinse. METHODS: Subjects meeting inclusion criteria were enrolled in the above-mentioned trials with efficacy end points 7 and 14 days post-treatment. Subjects were also evaluated on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 for the presence of erythema and edema using the Modified Draize Scale. Other comments associated with the safety evaluation (ie, pruritus) were collected. RESULTS: IPM was found to be effective in the proof of concept study and comparator trial using a positive control. IPM was also well tolerated, with minimal adverse events. All adverse events were mild, resolving by completion of the study. CONCLUSION: Data suggest that IPM is a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of head lice in children and adults. IPM's mechanical mechanism of action makes development of lice resistance unlikely.",

AT protects against the carcinogenic and mutagenic activity of ionizing radiation and chemical agents, and possibly against UV-induced cutaneous damage. For stability consideration, alpha-tocopherol is usually used as its prodrug ester, alpha-tocopherol acetate (ATA), which once absorbed into the skin is hydrolyzed to alpha-tocopherol, the active form. ... Permeation studies were conducted using modified Franz diffusion cells and human cadaver skin as the membrane. Specifically, 5% (w/w) alpha-tocopherol acetate was formulated in the following vehicles: ethanol, isopropyl myristate, light mineral oil, 1% Klucel gel in ethanol, and 3% Klucel gel in ethanol (w/w). ... The permeabilities of ATA through human cadaver skin were 1.0x10-4, 1.1x10-2, 1.4x10-4, 2.1x10-4, and 4.7x10-4 cm/hr for the ethanol solution, isopropyl myristate solution, light mineral oil solution, 1% Klucel gel, and 3% Klucel gel, respectively. The results show that the formulation had relatively minor effects on the permeability coefficients of ATA through cadaver skin in all cases except for the isopropyl myristate solution.",

Isopropyl myristate was distributed into the skin both trans-epidermally and trans-follicularly immediately after 24 hr application. Isopropyl myristate is thought to penetrate into human skin also, though it is known to generate no erythema on the skin. Isopropyl myristate was found to be distributed into almost all organs by means of whole body autoradiography when it was injected sc into mice. The extracts from the liver and kidney were determined to be a fatty acid and a triglyceride. Isopropyl myristate was easily distributed into the organs and metabolized.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Although this physical action of isopropyl myristate results in little lice resistance (given the lack of immunologic or chemical activity in this mechanism of action), the substance is also not ovicidal, which means any eggs that may have been laid by lice would not be affected. Moreover, isopropyl myristate is capable of eliciting its pediculicide action in a contact time of only 10 minutes per each necessary administration.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.35X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isopropyl myristate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase isopropyl myristate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 hours. Particulate-phase isopropyl myristate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Isopropyl myristate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isopropyl myristate is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 1.2X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.34X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. If released into water, isopropyl myristate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Isopropyl myristate, present at 100 mg/L, reached 94% of its chemical oxygen demand in 28 days using a municipal waste water inoculum in the closed bottle test, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.9 hours and 6.5 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 2800 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. An estimated base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 2.14X10-2 L/mole-sec corresponds to half-lives of 10 years and 1 year at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to isopropyl myristate may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isopropyl myristate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to isopropyl myristate via dermal contact due to its use in cosmetics and topical medicinal preparations. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.34X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.9 hours and 6.5 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 99 days when adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 2800(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 7.17(7) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 2.14X10-2 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(2); this corresponds to half-lives of 10 years and 1 year at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(8). Isopropyl myristate, present at 100 mg/L, reached 94% of its chemical oxygen demand in 28 days using a municipal waste water inoculum in the closed bottle test(9), suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process(SRC).",

Vapor-phase isopropyl myristate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.92X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase isopropyl myristate may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC).

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

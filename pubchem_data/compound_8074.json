When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Method 8240 can be used to quantify most volatile organic compounds that have boiling points below 200 \u00b0C and that are insoluble or slightly soluble in water, including the title compound. Volatile water-soluble compounds can be included in this analytical technique, however, for the more soluble compounds, quantitation limits are approximately ten times higher because of poor purging efficiency. The method is also limited to compounds that elute as sharp peaks from a gas chromatograph column packed with graphitized carbon lightly coated with a carbowax (6 ft by 0.1 in ID glass, packed with 1% SP-1000 on Carbopack-B (60/80 mesh) or equivalant). This gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method is based on a purge-and-trap procedure. The practical quantitation limit for Method 8240 for an individual compound is approximately 5 ug/kg (wet weight) for wastes and 5 ug/l for ground water. Practical quantitation limits will be proportionately higher for sample extracts and samples that require dilution or reduced sample size to avoid saturation of the detector.

In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, we ar a full-facepiece, self-contained breathing apparatus.  If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. 2-Chloroethyl vinyl ether can be ignited under almost all temperature conditions (flash point: 80 \u00b0F, open cup). When exposed to flame or sparks, 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether may explode.  When left standing, 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether may form peroxides which upon heating may detonate.  Also, upon heating to decomposition, this substance may emit highly toxic fumes of phosgene. For fires involving this substance, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, alcohol foam, or standard foa m. Fight the fire from a safe distance.  2-Chloroethyl vinyl ether should be stored in electrically-grounded containers, away from heat, sources of ignition, sources of physical damage, and oxidizing materials. 2-Chloroethyl vinyl ether is a potential candidate for disposal by fluidized bed, rotary kiln, or liquid injection forms of incineration.",

Vapor-phase 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 10.2 hrs and 1.3 days, respectively. If released to soil, 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 460. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.8X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Chloroethyl vinyl ether may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The theoretical biological oxygen demand for 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether was 76% and 52% (initial concn 5 and 10 mg/l, respectively) in seven days using settled domestic wastewater as a microbial inoculum. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.1 hrs and 4.1 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 20 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The rate constant for hydrolysis of 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether at a pH 7 is 4.4X10-10 1/sec which translates to a half-life of about 50 years. Occupational exposure to 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether may have occurred through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether was produced or used.

Volatilization of 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.8X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 26.8 mm Hg(4), and water solubility(2). The potential for volatilization of 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). As 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether is known to undergo general acid catalysis with an experimental rate constant of 0.168 l/mol-sec (7), hydrolysis in acidic soils would occur at a greater rate(SRC). The half-life for hydrolysis at pH 6 is 69 days; at pH 5, it is 6.9 days(SRC). Based on a studies in water, biodegradation of 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether may be possible in soil(SRC). In water, the theoretical biological oxygen demand for 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether was 76% and 52% (initial concn 5 and 10 mg/l, respectively) in seven days using settled domestic wastewater as a microbial inoculum(6,7).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.8X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 26.8 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 429 mg/l(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.1 hrs and 4.1 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 20(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). The rate constant for hydrolysis of 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether at a pH of 7 is 4.4X10-10 1/sec(4) which translates to a half-life of about 50 years(SRC). As 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether is known to undergo general acid catalysis with an experimental rate constant of 0.168 l/mol-sec (7), hydrolysis in acidic waters would occur at a greater rate(SRC). The half-life for hydrolysis at pH 6 is 69 days; at pH 5, it is 6.9 days(SRC). The theoretical biological oxygen demand for 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether was 76% and 52% (initial concn 5 and 10 mg/l, respectively) in seven days using settled domestic wastewater as a microbial inoculum(8,9).",

In the laboratory, 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether was shown to disappear in autoclaved samples of a model aquifer system, suggesting that abiotic processes were involved(5). A laboratory rapid-infiltration microcosm study showed that 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether was removed from the influent stream(6,7). 2-Chloroethyl vinyl ether is not expected to directly photolyze due to the lack of absorption in the environmental portion of the UV spectrum (>290 nm)(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 1.1 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 4.1 days(SRC). 2-Chloroethyl vinyl ether's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

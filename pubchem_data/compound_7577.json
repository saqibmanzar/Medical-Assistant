PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The method has been applied to the detection of 4,4'-methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline) and N-acetyl 4,4'-methylene dianiline in the the urine of workers occupationally exposed to 4,4'-methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline) and 4,4'-methylenedianiline.

Their relative concentrations (arithmetic means) were found to be in the following order: total MDA /greater than/ MAMDA /greater than/ MDA /greater than/ DAMDA. While MAMDA represented more than 50% of total MDA, MDA and DAMDA were lower than 15% and 3% respectively. Acetylation of MDA, described as a possible way of detoxification, is confirmed to be an important metabolism route in humans, essentially through the monoacetylated metabolite. However, the individual ratio MAMDA/total MDA was found to vary widely (roughly from 0% to 100%). The half-life was found to be between 9 and 14 hours.",

However, potential for dermal exposure is frequently high. The aromatic amines may permeate many of the commonly used protective gloves and thus may be particularly difficult to protect against.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Rats were initially given a single ip injection of diethylnitrosamine (200 mg/kg body weight) and fed a basal diet containing 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene from week 2 to week 8. Animals were subjected to partial hepatectomy at the end of week 3. From week 12 to week 36, they were given a basal diet containing 2% butylated hydroxyanisole, 1% butylated hydroxytoluene, 0.8% ethoxyquin, 1% alpha-tocopherol, 0.1% 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane, 1% acetaminophen, or 1% glutathione, then killed at week 40, 4 weeks after cessation of treatment with the test chemicals. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly decreased in the groups given ethoxyquin or 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane. Quantitative analysis of the number and area of hepatocellular carcinoma per unit liver area revealed a significant decrease in the area of hepatocellular carcinoma in the groups given ethoxyquin, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane or acetaminophen. The results suggest that ethoxyquin, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane and acetaminophen exerted an inhibitory effect on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, while butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, alpha-tocopherol and glutathione had no significant effect.",

Mean survival time tended to be longer in 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane supplemented groups, the difference being significant in diethylnitrosamine + 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane and N-ethyl-N-hydroxyethylnitrosamine + 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane groups. Intake of carcinogens was slightly but not significantly reduced by 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane. The incidences of hyperplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinomas were significantly decreased in 2-acetylaminofluorene or 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene + 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane groups. Pulmonary metastases were also less common in 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazo benzene or N-ethyl-N-hydroxyethylnitrosamine + 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane groups. Development of papillomas in the esophagus but not in tumors in the forestomach was also inhibited by 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane. Inhibition in the different organs was not significantly related to decrease in body weight or carcinogen intake, indicating a mechanism independent of non-specific toxic effects or reduction in food consumption. Some other factors possibly related to its ability to cause bile duct proliferation and/or altered activity of enzymes relevant to drug metabolism may be involved.",

Determination of MDA remaining in the patch units after exposure showed that a median of 28% (range 25-29%) was absorbed. After hydrolyzing MDA has been determined in plasma with an initial peak and a decline after removing the patch. MDA was also detected in hydrolyzed urine. The maximum rate of MDA excretion in urine was found 6-11 hours after the onset of exposure. Within two subjects studied at three doses, the urinary excretion was proportional to the exposure. The elimination half-lives in plasma and urine had medians at 13 and 7 hours, respectively. In eight out of nine exposures, the elimination half-life was longer in plasma than in urine. Slow acetylation seemed to be associated with short elimination half-life in urine. The median of total MDA amount excreted in urine during 48 hours, was 33 nmol for the five subjects exposed to 0.75 umol, which corresponds to roughly 16% (range 2%-26%) of the absorbed dose.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fasted for 24 hours before and after receiving several doses within 25-225 mg/kg body weight (2 mL/kg volume each). At 24 hours after treatment the common bile duct was cannulated, and bile was collected for 30 mm. The rats were then ensanguined and blood collected. Oral administration of the substance caused a dose-dependent change in all markers of liver injury: The threshold for toxicity was between 25 and 75 mg/kg substance. Methylene dianiline caused concomitant changes in all markers of liver injury measured, including serum ALT, bile flow, serum bilirubin concentration, GGT activity, and liver weight. Liver sections from animals that received a dose of 100 mg/kg had multifocal lesions consisting of hepatocellular necrosis with hemorrhage and moderate neutrophil infiltration. The necrosis involved segments of periportal hepatocytes but did not surround portal tracts. Frequently, the parenchymal insult extended into the mid-zonal regions of hepatic lobules. The lesions associated with the portal triad consisted of bile neutrophil infiltration. A segmental necrotizing vasculitis of the portal vein was also evident. The earliest change identified with the hepatotoxicity of methylene dianiline was bile ductular necrosis, and histologic markers of liver injury continued to increase in severity over the course of 16 hours. Histologic analysis of livers from animals receiving corn oil vehicle demonstrated normal hepatic histology with no apparent lesions.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.03X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12.8 hours. Particulate-phase 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 4,4'-Diaminodiphenylmethane contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane is expected to have slight to no mobility based upon Koc values ranging from of 3825 to 5681. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.3X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. 4,4'-Diaminodiphenylmethane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A 0% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test suggests that biodegradation will not be an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. 4,4'-Diaminodiphenylmethane, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test, suggesting that biodegradation will not be an important fate process in the aquatic environment. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Measured BCF values of 3.0 to 14 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane via dermal contact with consumer products containing 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12.8 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.00X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Particulate-phase 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). 4,4'-Diaminodiphenylmethane contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 12.8 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). 4,4'-Diaminodiphenylmethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). 4,4'-Diaminodiphenylmethane contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). As a class, aromatic amines react relatively rapidly in sunlit natural water via reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals and peroxy radicals(4); typical half-lives for hydroxyl radical and peroxy radical reactions are on the order of 19 to 30 sunlight hours(4). Exposure of crystalline 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane to air and light results in oxidation of the crystals(darkening in color) and the formation of polymeric amines(5,6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(2), these measured Koc values suggest that 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane is expected to have slight to no mobility in soil. The reaction of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane with soil humics was studied by allowing the substance to remain in contact with soil for 7 days and then measuring desorption in 1 day. The results suggested that 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane sorbed onto soil may be in a relatively facile equilibrium with the surrounding solution as shown by the similarity of distribution ratios (sorbed compound (in ug/g of soil)/concentrated in solution (in ug/mL)) for both sorption and desorption with Rdesorb/Rsorb ranging from 1.1 to 1.4(1). In this study the average ratio of aerobic/anaerobic soil sorption coefficients for 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane was 1.27, suggesting little difference between the behavior of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane with soil under oxidizing and reducing conditions(1). Aromatic amines have been observed to undergo rapid and reversible covalent bonding with humic materials in aqueous solution; the initial bonding reaction is followed by a slower and much less reversible reaction believed to represent the addition of the amine to quinoidal structures followed by oxidation of the product to give an amino-substituted quinone; these processes represent pathways by which aromatic amines may be converted to latent forms in the biosphere(3).",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Presurgical screening for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) includes the intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP), consisting of two consecutive injections of amobarbital, ipsilateral and contralateral to the epileptic focus. We studied whether a bilateral IAP has added value to a unilateral, ipsilateral IAP. METHODS: This population-based study included 183 consecutive patients referred for screening for TLE surgery who underwent bilateral IAP. Using multivariable modeling, we assessed the added value of bilateral IAP on the decision for surgery, resection size, amygdalohippocampectomy, post-operative seizure freedom, memory performance, and IQ change. RESULTS: Given the results from the unilateral IAP, the bilateral IAP had added prognostic value for postoperative change in verbal memory (P < 0.01) and verbal IQ (P < 0.01), especially if patients had a left-sided focus. In contrast, information provided by the contralateral IAP was not associated with decision-making or surgical strategy. CONCLUSIONS: A bilateral IAP has added value in predicting post-operative verbal memory and IQ. A bilateral IAP is currently not used to guide surgical strategy, but may be used for this purpose when verbal capacity is of particular concern in patients with a left-sided focus. In other cases, IAP is best performed unilaterally.",

The total daily amt of phenobarbital then is administered as a single dose or in 3 or 4 divided doses, not to exceed 600 mg/day. If signs of withdrawal occur on the first day of treatment, a loading dose of 100 to 200 mg of phenobarbital may be administered intramuscularly in addition to the oral dose. After stabilization on phenobarbital, the total daily dose is decreased by 30 mg/day as long as withdrawal is proceeding smoothly. This regimen may be modified by initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage level and decreasing the daily dosage by 10% if tolerated by the patient. 3) For infants physically dependent on barbiturates, initially a dose of 3 to 10 mg of phenobarbital/kg bw/day may be given. After withdrawal symptoms (hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, tremors, hyperreflexia) are relieved, the dosage of phenobarbital should be gradually decreased and completely withdrawn over a 2-wk period. 4) Also, barbiturate withdrawal may be accomplished with benzodiazepines, such as diazepam. /Barbiturates/",

Where one barbiturate was ingested, an inverse relationship between lipid solubility of the drug and the distribution in fluids and tissues was observed. In most cases the liver, and in the remainder the spleen, contained the highest concn of barbiturate. Bile concn were often in excess of those in the corresponding liver. The metabolites of the 4 sedative barbiturates were usually present in lower amounts than the parent drugs in the fluids and tissues of most subjects, but urine often contained much higher concn of metabolites, sometimes exceeding that of the parent drug in the liver.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

These are binding sites that are distinct from GABA itself and also distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site. Like benzodiazepines, barbiturates potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor.  This GABAA receptor binding decreases input resistance, depresses burst and tonic firing, especially in ventrobasal and intralaminar neurons, while at the same time increasing burst duration and mean conductance at individual chloride channels; this increases both the amplitude and decay time of inhibitory postsynaptic currents.  In addition to this GABA-ergic effect, barbiturates also block the AMPA receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptor. Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS.  Amobarbital also appears to bind neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.",

This ester, in absolute alcohol solution, is treated with the theoretical quantity of metallic sodium to replace one hydrogen of the CH2 group, then a slight excess of the theoretical amount of an ethylating agent, such as ethyl bromide, is added. The second hydrogen is replaced similarly, using isopentyl bromide as the alkylating agent.  The diethyl ester of ethyl isopentyl malonic acid thus obtained is heated in an alcoholic solution, in the presence of sodium, with urea. Sodium amobarbital is formed, from which amobarbital is liberated with HCl. The alkylation of the CH2 group of the malonic ester ... may be done in two stages, introducing one alkyl group at a time.",

These are binding sites that are distinct from GABA itself and also distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site. Like benzodiazepines, barbiturates potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor.  This GABAA receptor binding decreases input resistance, depresses burst and tonic firing, especially in ventrobasal and intralaminar neurons, while at the same time increasing burst duration and mean conductance at individual chloride channels; this increases both the amplitude and decay time of inhibitory postsynaptic currents.  In addition to this GABA-ergic effect, barbiturates also block the AMPA receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptor. Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS.  Amobarbital also appears to bind neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. ",

Hypersensitivity reactions are most likely to occur in patients with asthma, urticaria, or angioedema. Rarely, photosensitivity reactions have been reported. Phenobarbital, metharbital, and mephobarbital appear to cause rashes more frequently than do other barbiturates. Exfoliative dermatitis, which may be accompanied by hepatitis and jaundice, has occurred rarely and has resulted in a few fatalities. Rarely, cutaneous reactions have preceded the development of barbiturate-induced systemic lupus erythematosus. Adverse cutaneous reactions may proceed to an irreversible stage even though the medication has been discontinued, because barbiturates are slowly metabolized and excreted.  /Barbiturates General Statement/",

Amobarbital (AB), 500 ppm, was given in the drinking water from week 6 to 78. This group was compared to a N-nitrosodiethylamine only treated group (30 animals). There were no significant differences between the groups in survival, weight gain, or induced tumors. At 52 weeks, when 1/2 of the animals were autopsied, 1/15 amobarbital and N-nitrosodiethylamine treated animals with hepatocellular tumors compared with 2/15 for the N-nitrosodiethylamine alone treated group. At 78 weeks, 8/15 of the amobarbital and N-nitrosodiethylamine treated animals had hepatocellular tumors compared with 10/15 for the N-nitrosodiethylamine alone treated group. There were no increases in any other tumors over the N-nitrosodiethylamine group. Additionally, Amobarbital was tested alone. Twenty-five animals were injected with saline (5 ml/kg body weight) at 4 weeks of age and given 500 ppm amobarbital in the drinking water from 6 to 78 weeks. They were compared to the saline injected only group. There were no effects of amobarbital on survival or body weight for the 78 weeks of the experiment. There were no hepatocellular tumors in the amobarbital or the saline groups at 52 or at 78 weeks. There were no significant differences in the number of tumors at other sites.",

Four-week-old F344/NCr male rats were given a single ip injection of 75 mg DENA/kg body weight. Beginning 2 weeks later, they were given either tap water (group 1) or drinking water containing 500 ppm of PB (group 2), the sodium salt of BB (group 3), AB (group 4), or BA (group 5) for the remaining experimental period. Control groups (groups 6-10) received an ip injection of saline alone and 2 weeks later were given either tap water or drinking water containing barbiturates as listed above. Animals were sacrificed at either 52 weeks or 78 weeks. None of the barbiturates altered the growth and survival of animals. PB and BB increased liver weights and significantly enhanced the development of hepatocellular foci and hepatocellular adenomas at 52 weeks and hepatocellular foci, hepatocellular adenomas, and trabecular carcinomas at 78 weeks in DENA-treated rats. No such enhancing effects were observed with AB or BA. PB or BB did not significantly enhance the incidence of nonhepatic tumors at 52 weeks. However, at 78 weeks BB significantly enhanced the development of renal tubular adenomas and carcinomas, while PB enhanced the development of thyroid follicular cell neoplasms in DENA-treated rats. These results clearly showed that barbiturates exhibited structure-promoting activity relationships and that their promoting abilities were not restricted to liver alone. Substitution of both hydrogen atoms at the C-5 position of the pyrimidine ring by alkyl or aryl groups appears to be essential but not sufficient for tumor-promoting activity of barbiturates.",

Groups of 40 B6C3F1 male mice were injected i.p. at 15 days of age with 5 micrograms DEN/g body wt. Beginning at 4 weeks of age, DEN treated groups were given either normal drinking water or water containing either 0.05% PB or AB for up to 36 weeks. DEN alone induced multiple focal hepatic lesions including hepatocellular foci, hepatocellular adenomas and trabecular carcinomas. Subsequent exposure to PB had a suppressing effect on DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Hepatocellular foci in PB-exposed mice were significantly smaller in size (area) and fewer in number throughout the study. Also, PB treatment either prolonged the latency period or significantly slowed the rate at which hepatocellular tumors developed in these mice. No such effects were seen in AB-exposed mice; AB neither inhibited nor promoted the development of focal hepatic lesions in DEN-pretreated mice. Possible mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis include the feminizing effects of perinatal administration of PB.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

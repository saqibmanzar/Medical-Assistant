Enflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane.

Enflurane also binds to and angonizes the GABA receptor, the large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated potassium channel, the glycine receptor, and antagonizes the glutamate receptor receptor.

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Although individual anesthetic enantiomers have been shown to exhibit a difference in anesthetic efficacy, metabolism of anesthetic enantiomers has not been reported. Human liver enflurane metabolism to difluoromethoxydifluoroacetic acid (DFMDFA) and inorganic fluoride is catalyzed in vivo and in vitro by cytochrome P450 2E1. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize enflurane racemate and enantiomer metabolism to test the hypothesis that fluorinated ether anesthetic metabolism by cytochrome P450 2E1 exhibits substrate stereoselectivity. Enflurane metabolism by microsomes from three human livers and by microsomes containing cDNA-expressed human P450 2E1 was measured at saturating enflurane concentrations. DFMDFA was quantitated with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry by detection of the ethanolamide derivative. In microsomes from all three livers, (R)-enflurane metabolism was significantly greater than that of (S)-enflurane, whereas rates of racemic enflurane metabolism were generally between those seen for the R- and S-enantiomers. The ratio of (R)-enflurane to (S)-enflurane metabolism in the three livers studied was 2.1:1, 1.9:1, and 1.4:1. (R)-, (S)-, and racemic enflurane were all metabolized by expressed P450 2E1. The ratio of (R)-enflurane to (S)-enflurane metabolism was 1.9:1. The metabolic enantiomeric selectivity of human liver P450 2E1 for (R)-enflurane suggests that enflurane metabolism by P450 2E1 occurs by direct substrate oxidation, rather than indirectly through the generation of a P450-dependent reactive oxygen species, and supports the hypothesis that the P450 2E1 active site is somewhat restrictive and capable of stereochemical discrimination.",

The formation of the metabolite in rat liver microsomes was dependent upon the presence of NADPH and O2, and was inhibited when SKF 525-A or CO/O2 (8:2, v/v) were present in the reaction mixture. When the C-H bonds of the CHCIF group of enflurane or of the CHCI group of isoflurane (CHF2OCHCICF3) were replaced with a C-CI bond, virtually no fluoride ion was produced from either derivative in rat liver microsomes. These results indicate that cytochrome P-450 catalyzes the oxidative dehalogenation of CHF2OCF2CHCIF at its CHCIF group to form CHF2OCF2CO2H and chloride and fluoride ions. In contrast, the CHF2 group does not appear to be appreciably susceptible to metabolic oxidative dehalogenation...",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Other studies have found that enflurane binds to the calcium channels in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum causing cardio depressant effects. Other studies support that this drug potentiates glycine receptors, which results in central nervous system depressant effects.",

Although originally attributed to its oxidative metabolism to inorganic fluoride, serum levels of inorganic fluoride appear to be small to explain these renal effects.

Alkaline degradation products of enflurane can be conjugated to thiol compounds, forming S-conjugates that could theoretically contribute to adverse renal effects observed occasionally with enflurane anesthesia. The N-acetyl-L-cysteine S-conjugates identified may be biomarkers to assess exposure of humans to alkaline degradation products of enflurane.",

Microsomal adducts were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting techniques utilizing specific anti-trifluoroacetyl (TFA) IgG hapten antibodies in rat liver following enflurane, isoflurane, or halothane administration. Preincubation of the antibodies with microsomes from halothane-pretreated rats or with 500 uM TFA-lysine, markedly inhibited adduct recognition, while preincubation with 500 uM acetyllysine had no effect. The relative amounts of immunoreactive protein adducts formed were halothane much greater than enflurane much greater than isoflurane and correlates directly with the relative extents of metabolism of these agents. These results support the view that acyl metabolites of the volatile anesthetics may become covalently bound to hepatic proteins, thus serving as antigens, and thereby account for the apparent cross-sensitization and idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity reported for these drugs.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Appearance of ALT levels above 10 times the upper limit of normal, however, is distinctly unusual and points to significant hepatotoxicity. Clinically apparent, severe hepatic injury from enflurane has been reported but is very rare. The injury resembles halothane hepatotoxicity and is marked by acute elevations in serum aminotransferase levels (5- to 50-fold) and appearance of jaundice 2 to 21 days after surgery and anesthesia. There are usually minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase levels. The liver injury is often preceded by a day or two of fever and may be accompanied by rash and eosinophilia. The acute liver injury may be self-limited and resolve within 4 to 8 weeks, but can be severe and associated with acute liver failure. A strong risk factor is previous exposure to any of the halogenated anesthetics and particularly a history of halothane hepatitis or unexplained fever and rash after anesthesia with one of these agents.",

Because the serum half-life of enflurane in the mother is short and the drug is not expected to be absorbed by the infant, no waiting period or discarding of milk is required. Breastfeeding can be resumed as soon as the mother has recovered sufficiently from general anesthesia to nurse. When a combination of anesthetic agents is used for a procedure, follow the recommendations for the most problematic medication used during the procedure. In one study, breastfeeding before general anesthesia induction reduced requirements of sevoflurane and propofol compared to those of nursing mothers whose breastfeeding was withheld or nonnursing women. It is possible that requirements for other anesthetic agents would be affected similarly.",

After delivery, patients in all groups received an infusion of oxytocin 30 international units in 1 L of saline, and 0.2 mg of methylergonovine if they were not hypertensive. Fentanyl 1 to 1.5 mcg/kg was administered after delivery to the general anesthesia group. Patients in the general anesthesia group (n = 21) had higher post-procedure prolactin levels and a longer mean time to lactation initiation (25 hours) than in the other groups (10.8 to 11.8 hours). Postpartum oxytocin levels in the nonmedicated vaginal delivery group were higher than in the general and spinal anesthesia groups.",

Groups 1 and 2 were controls exposed only to halothane and enflurane, respectively. Group 3 was exposed for 1 hr to 0.3% halothane, followed by 2 hr of 1% enflurane. Group 4 was exposed for 1 hr to 1% halothane and then to 2 hr of 1% enflurane. Blood samples were taken prior to, immediately following, and 1, 24, and 48 hr after anesthetic exposure. Serum was assayed for inorganic fluoride (F-), SGOT and SGPT. Twenty-four-hour urinary collections were assayed for F excretion. Group 1 rats exposed to halothane alone had the lowest peak mean serum F- (5.0 uM). Group 2 rats exposed to enflurane alone had the highest serum F concentration 4 hr after anesthesia (18.7 uM). Peak serum F in Group 3 rats (9.5 uM) was significantly lower than in Group 2 rats (enflurane control). In Group 4 rats, serum F- was not significantly different from Group 1 rats (halothane control) at any time. In the first 24 hr after anesthetic exposure, urinary F- excretion in Groups 2 and 3 was significantly higher than in Groups 1 and 4. This study demonstrated that prior exposure to halothane reduced the metabolism of enflurane; previous work suggested that this was due to an interaction of halothane with hepatic cytochrome P-450.",

The influence of ethanol and ... /6 hours a day, 5 days a week exposure/ to subanesthetic and anesthetic concentrations of enflurane on liver function in BALB/c mice /was examined/.  ... Animals were divided in six groups of twenty. The ethanol treated group was injected with ethanol ip (1 g/kg). Two enflurane treated groups were ip injected with a 0.9 % solution of sodium chloride (10 mL/kg) and one /was also/ exposed to subanesthetic (0.5 vol%) and the other one to anesthetic (2.75 vol%) concentrations of enflurane. ... /Two additional/ groups received ethanol (1 g/kg) and each of them inhaled enflurane at previously mentioned doses. The control group was ip injected with a 0.9 % solution of sodium chloride (10 mL/kg) and did not receive any anesthetic. On the day following the last day of exposure half of the animals from each group were sacrificed for determination of glucose levels, erythrocyte glutathion levels, hematocrit, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver protein and glutathione levels, and total cytochrome P-450 (CYP P-450). The other half ... from each group were injected ip with caffeine (20 mg/kg). ... Two caffeine metabolic ratios - 1,3-dimethyl uric acid and 3,7-xanthine ... and 3,7-dimethyl xanthine + 7-xanthine and 1-xanthine + 1,7-dimethyl uric acid ... /were measured/. The difference in caffeine metabolite ratios suggests that enflurane changes oxidative metabolism in liver via certain subtypes of mixed function oxidase, probably via CYP-4502E1. This effect is more expressed when ethanol and enflurane are applied together. Ethanol is well known inductor of CYP-4502E1 and the registrated enzyme induction could be explained by both influences - of ethanol and enflurane.",

Disulfiram, which is converted in vivo to a selective inhibitor of P450 2E1, was used as a metabolic probe for P450 2E1. ... Twenty patients undergoing elective surgery were randomized to receive disulfiram (500 mg orally; n = 10) or nothing (control subjects; n = 10) the evening before surgery. All patients received a standard anesthetic of enflurane (2.2% end-tidal) in oxygen for 3 hours. Blood enflurane concentrations were measured by gas chromatography. Plasma and urine fluoride concentrations were quantitated by ion-selective electrode. ...  Patient groups were similar with respect to age, weight, gender, duration of surgery, and blood loss. Total enflurane dose, measured by cumulative end-tidal enflurane concentrations (3.9 to 4.1 MAC-hr) and by blood enflurane concentrations, was similar in both groups. Plasma fluoride concentrations increased from 3.6 +/- 1.5 umol/L (baseline) to 24.3 +/- 3.8 umol/L (peak) in untreated patients (mean +/- SE). Disulfiram treatment completely abolished the rise in plasma fluoride concentration. Urine fluoride excretion was similarly significantly diminished in disulfiram-treated patients. Fluoride excretion in disulfiram-treated patients was 62 +/- 10 and 61 +/- 12 umol on days 1 and 2, respectively, compared with 1090 +/- 180 and 1200 +/- 220 umol in control subjects (p < 0.05 on each day). CONCLUSIONS: Disulfiram prevented fluoride ion production after enflurane anesthesia. These results suggest that P450 2E1 is the predominant P450 isoform responsible for human clinical enflurane metabolism in vivo.",

The histologic changes are neither unique nor consistent. In several of these cases, it has not been possible to exclude enflurane as the cause or as a contributing cause to liver injury. The incidence of unexplained hepatotoxicity following the administration of enflurane is unknown, but it appears to be rare and not dose related. Enflurane has also been associated with perioperative hyperkalemia. There have been rare post-marketing reports of hepatic failure and hepatic necrosis associated with the use of potent volatile anesthetic agents, including Enflurane. Due to the spontaneous nature of these reports, the actual incidence and  relationship of Enflurane to these events cannot be established with certainty.",

Mice previously treated with AIA (350 mg/kg, ip.) or imidazole (400 mg/kg, ip) received a single dose (1 mL/kg, i.p.) of enflurane or isoflurane and were killed 20 min after anesthetic administration.  Induction of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase (ALA-S) activity was found, as expected, in animals receiving AIA and also in animals treated with AIA plus anesthesia, but no change in the activity of either porphobilinogenase (PBGase) or porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D) activities was detected in these two groups of animals. ... When mice were injected with imidazol alone or in combination with the /anesthetic/, ALA-S activity was increased 50-90% in all groups, but again no change in PBGase or PBG-D activity was observed. ... In conclusion, ...  enflurane /did not cause/ additional disturbances in heme metabolism to those produced by AIA or imidazole alone.",

To evaluate the nephrotoxic potential of sevoflurane, 1-yr-old male Fischer 344 rats were anesthetized with 10 minimal alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) hr sevoflurane or enflurane with or without pretreatment with biotransformation-enhancing agents. Peak serum fluoride levels reached 35 uM with sevoflurane anesthesia after pretreatment with phenobarbital and 40 uM after enflurane anesthesia after pretreatment with isoniazid. One day after anesthesia, sevoflurane-anesthetized rats concentrated urine normally in response to subcutaneous administration of 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin and exhibited no increase in urinary excretion of N-acetyl beta-glucosaminidase. Isoniazid-treated, enflurane anesthetized rats developed a 31% reduction in maximal urinary concentrating ability and a 3.5-fold increase in excretion of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. Sevoflurane produced no evidence of fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity in noninduced or enzyme-induced rats. Under similar conditions, enflurane produced laboratory evidence of nephrotoxicity.",

Exposure of fed rats to enflurane (1.5%) and isoflurane (1.4%) in conjunction with low oxygen tensions resulted in no liver necrosis; however, in fasting animals, these same concentrations, when accompanied by low oxygen concentrations, produced an incidence of liver necrosis of 35% and 80%, respectively. Lower concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane failed to produce hepatotoxicity. In this study, in addition to increasing the incidence of toxicity, fasting reduced the glutathione levels and also increased cytochrome P-450 concentrations. Exposure to halothane and to isoflurane, but not to enflurane, further decreased the glutathione level. Perhaps the mechanism of liver toxicity associated with anesthesia, at least in this animal model, is related more directly to severe hypoxia than to a direct toxic intermediate produced as a result of metabolism.",

No signs of general toxicity were found. There was a normal increase in weight, and normal food consumption, organ to body weight ratios and normal histological findings in liver, kidney and lung. Exposure to 500 ppm (0.05 MAC) of halothane induced the activity of NADPH-cytochrome-c-reductase in the liver, decreased the concentration of cytochrome P-450 in the kidney and decreased all the enzyme concentrations measured in lung microsomes. Exposure to halothane 50 ppm (0.005 MAC) and enflurane produced only minor changes. It is concluded that the inhalation of halothane, in contrast to enflurane, may affect drug metabolism and thereby drug kinetics and toxicity. ...",

Enflurane is a Fluorinated Greenhouse Gas, many of which are Ozone-depleting substances that are currently being phased out and otherwise regulated under the Montreal Protocol and Title VI of the Clean Air Act. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 174.5 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates enflurane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase enflurane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.7 years. Enflurane's photochemical lifetime was calculated as 5,340 years; therefore, it is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, enflurane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 100. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.5X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Enflurane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, enflurane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.1 hours and 5.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound is stable to hydrolysis under alkaline conditions. Occupational exposure to enflurane may occur through inhalation at workplaces where enflurane is produced or used. Use data indicate that exposure to enflurane among the general population may be limited to those administered enflurane as an anesthetic. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.5X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 174.5 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 5.62X10+3 mg/L(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.1 hours and 5.4 days, respectively(SRC).

Enflurane does not degrade in the presence of alkali or light(3). Enflurane had substantial UV absorption only below 250 nm; its photochemical lifetime (50 deg N latitude, equinox) was calculated as 5,340 years(1).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that enflurane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 4.1 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5.4 days(SRC). Enflurane's calculated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of enflurane from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Ingestion of higher than recommended doses results in untoward effects including cerebral hemorrhage. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to determine both the pharmacokinetic profile and physiologic responses of DMAA.  Eight men reported to the lab in the morning following an overnight fast and received a single 25 mg oral dose of DMAA. Blood samples were collected before and through 24 hours post-DMAA ingestion and analyzed for plasma DMAA concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Resting heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature was also measured. One subject was excluded from the data analysis due to abnormal DMAA levels. Analysis of the remaining seven participants showed DMAA had an oral clearance of 20.02+/- 5 L/hr, an oral volume of distribution of 236+/- 38 L, and terminal half-life of 8.45+/- 1.9 hr. Lag time, the delay in appearance of DMAA in the circulation following extravascular administration, varied among participants but averaged approximately 8 minutes (0.14+/- 0.13 hr). The peak DMAA concentration for all subjects was observed within 3-5 hours following ingestion and was very similar across subjects, with a mean of ~70 ng/mL. Heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature were largely unaffected by DMAA treatment. These are the first data to characterize the oral pharmacokinetic profile of DMAA. These findings indicate a consistent pattern of increase across subjects with regards to peak DMAA concentration, with peak values approximately 15-30 times lower than those reported in case studies linking DMAA intake with adverse events. Finally, a single 25 mg dose of DMAA does not meaningfully impact resting heart rate, blood pressure, or body temperature.",

Alleged to occur in nature, DMAA has become a widely used ingredient in sports food supplements, despite its status as a doping agent and concerns over its safety. There is now some doubt as to whether it can be sourced naturally or whether it actually occurs naturally at all. The presence of DMAA was investigated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in extracts of the leaves and stems of four geranium species and of three well-known cultivars. The amounts of DMAA in commercial geranium (Pelargonium graveolens) oil and the leading sports supplement which uses the ingredient were also measured. DMAA was not found in any of the leaves or stems or in the commercial geranium oil included in this study. Approximately 30 mg per daily dose was found in the food supplement. Therefore, the amount of DMAA found in the supplement is most unlikely to have been /found/ in nature, and it must be concluded that synthetic DMAA, known to be capable of causing severe adverse physiological effects, has been added.",

The stereoisomeric ratios of DMAA in the synthetic standards and in all the commercial supplements were indistinguishable. Eight different commercial geranium extracts of different geographical origins (China and the Middle East) were examined for the presence of DMAA by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). No DMAA was detected in any of the eight geranium products with a limit of detection of 10 parts per billion (w/w).",

Recently, the DoD laboratories have observed a significant decrease in the confirmation rates for amphetamines because of specimens screening positive by two separate immunoassays and confirming negative by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Previous studies conducted by the Division of Forensic Toxicology, Armed Force Institute of Pathology (AFIP) utilizing a GC-MS basic drug screen and a designer drug screen revealed no common compound or compound classes as to the cause of the immunoassay-positive results. Additional information obtained from an immunoassay vendor suggested the anorectic compound dimethylamylamine (DMAA) may be the cause of the false-positive screens. An additional 134 false-positive samples were received and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) for DMAA. LC-MS-MS analysis revealed the presence of DMAA in 92.3% of the false-positive samples at a concentration of approximately 6.0 mg/L DMAA, causing a positive screen on both immunoassay kits.",

Whether 1,3-DMAA naturally occurs in geranium plants or other dietary ingredients, it has important regulatory and commercial ramifications. However, the analysis of 1,3-DMAA in geranium plants is not trivial due to low concentrations and a complex environmental matrix, requiring high selectivity and sensitivity. An extraction method combined with high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry is used to determine 1,3-DMAA and 1,4-dimethylamylamine (1,4-DMAA) concentrations in geranium plants with both external calibration and standard addition method. Samples from the Changzhou, Kunming, and Guiyang regions of China during both winter and summer were analyzed for 1,3-DMAA and 1,4-DMAA. The diastereomer ratios of the 1,3-DMAA stereoisomers of a racemic standard and the extracted plant were also quantified.",

The sample was extracted with 0.5 M HCl and purified by liquid-liquid partition with hexane. The parameters for reverse-phase (C18) LC and positive ESI/MS/MS were optimized. The matrix effect, specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy and reproducibility of the method were determined and evaluated. The method was linear over a range of 0.10-10.00 ng/mL examined, with R(2) of 0.99 for both 1,3-DMAA and 1,4-DMAA. The recoveries from spiked concentrations between 5.00-40.00 ng/g were 85.1%-104.9% for 1,3-DMAA, with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.9%-11.0%, and 82.9%-101.8% for 1,4-DMAA, with RSD of 3.2%-11.7%. The instrument detection limit was 1-2 pg for both DMAAs. The quantification limit was estimated to be 1-2 ng/g for the plant sample.

Before and after 6 and 12 weeks of supplementation, the following variables were measured: body mass/composition, resting respiratory rate, blood pressure, 12-lead electrocardiogram, urinalysis, complete blood count, metabolic panel, lipid panel, and oxidative stress, inflammatory, and cardiac biomarkers. No interaction effects were noted for any variable (p > 0.05), with little change occurring across time for subjects in any of the four conditions. With the exception of urinary pH (p = 0.05; Pre (6.5 +/- 0.1) higher than week 6 (6.1 +/- 0.1)) and blood CO2 (p = 0.02; week 12 (25.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/L) higher than week 6 (24.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/L)), no time effect was noted for any other variable (p > 0.05).

Our prior work with this agent indicates a transient increase in blood pressure (systolic in particular) following oral ingestion of a single dosage, but no significant increase in resting blood pressure following chronic ingestion. Moreover, intervention studies involving both two and eight weeks of treatment with finished products containing 1,3-dimethylamylamine indicate minimal or no change in bloodborne markers of health. The present study sought to extend these findings by using a 10-week intervention trial to determine the change in selected markers of health in a sample of men. Methods: 25 healthy men were randomly assigned to either a placebo (n = 13) or to a supplement containing 1,3-dimethylamylamine (n = 12) for a period of 10 weeks. Before and after the intervention, resting blood pressure and heart rate were measured, and blood samples were collected for determination of complete blood count, metabolic panel, and lipid panel. Results: No significant differences were noted between conditions for blood pressure (P > 0.05), although systolic blood pressure increased approximately 6 mmHg with the supplement (diastolic blood pressure decreased approximately 4 mmHg). A main effect for time was noted for heart rate (P = 0.016), with values decreasing from pre to post intervention. There were significant main effects for time for creatinine (increased from pre to post intervention; P = 0.043) and alkaline phosphatase (decreased from pre to post intervention; P = 0.009), with no condition differences noted (P > 0.05). There was a significant interaction noted for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P = 0.043), with values decreasing in the supplement group from pre to post intervention approximately 7 mg/ dL (P = 0.034). No other effects of significance were noted for bloodborne variables. Conclusion: These data indicate that a dietary supplement containing 1,3-dimethylamylamine does not result in a statistically significant increase in resting heart rate or blood pressure (although systolic blood pressure is increased approx. 6 mmHg with supplement use). The supplement does not negatively impact bloodborne markers of health. Further study is needed involving a longer intervention period, a larger sample size, and additional measures of health and safety.",

Dogs were pithed, and the amines were injected as sulfate salts into the femoral veins. Doses ranging from 5 to 100 milligrams were tested. Pressor activity was compared with that of epinephrine (51434), and only with reference to the intensity of action. The results were analyzed with reference to chemical structures. When the amino group (NH2) was attached to the second carbon atom of n-alkanes, it invariably became a stronger product than when NH2 was attached to the terminal carbon atom. In the pentane series, substitution of a methyl group at carbon 4 was better than at carbon 3. Methylation of carbon 4 increased the pressor activity when NH2 was on carbon 2. A second methyl group decreased the activity. Ethylation of carbon 5 had less effect than methylation at the same position when NH2 was on carbon 2. In the 2-aminooctane (693163) series, neither methylation at carbon 4 nor hydroxylation at carbon 3 increased pressor activity. Introduction of a methyl group at carbon 6 made 3-aminoheptane (28292424) entirely inactive. The presence of a double bond decreased activity. The most active amine tested was 2-amino-4-methylhexane (105419), followed by 2-aminoheptane (123820); both had seven carbon atoms. The authors conclude that NH2 on carbon 2 has the most favorable influence on pressor activity. The optimal chain length for pressor activity is seven carbons.",

In 2012, the US FDA issued warning letters to companies notifying them products with 1,3-dimethylamylamine need to be taken off the market. The US FDA is not aware of any reliable science indicating that 1,3-dimethylamylamine exists naturally in plants. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,3-dimethylamylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,3-dimethylamylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours. 1,3-Dimethylamylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,3-dimethylamylamine is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. The estimated pKa of 1,3-dimethylamylamine is 10.6, indicating that this compound will exist primarily in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 1,3-Dimethylamylamine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Environmental biodegradation data specific to 1,3-dimethylamylamine were not available. However, similar aliphatic amines have been classified as readily biodegradable using the Japanese MITI test. If released into water, 1,3-dimethylamylamine may have moderate adsorption to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may occur based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.1 and 11.1 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 12 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,3-dimethylamylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,3-dimethylamylamine is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 1,3-dimethylamylamine via ingestion of dietary supplements containing the compound; however, dietary supplements containing 1,3-dimethylamylamine are illegal and US FDA is doing everything within its authority to remove these products from the market, but 1,3-dimethylamylamine does exist illegally in some supplements.

The pKa of 1,3-dimethylamylamine is estimated to be 10.6(SRC) based on analogy to similar amines(3), indicating that this compound will exist primarily in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Volatilization of 1,3-dimethylamylamine from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(2). 1,3-Dimethylamylamine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 8.9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2). Environmental biodegradation data specific to 1,3-dimethylamylamine were not available(SRC, 2014). However, similar aliphatic amines (such as amylamine and sec-butylamine) have been classified as readily biodegradable using the Japanese MITI test where these aliphatic amines, present at 100 mg/L, reached 75-94% of theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L(5).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.1 and 11.1 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 12(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.16(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 1,3-Dimethylamylamine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Environmental biodegradation data specific to 1,3-dimethylamylamine were not available(SRC, 2014). However, similar aliphatic amines (such as amylamine and sec-butylamine) have been classified as readily biodegradable using the Japanese MITI test where these aliphatic amines, present at 100 mg/L, reached 75-94% of theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

It includes the likely routes of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, skin and eye contact), and the delayed, immediate, or chronic effects/symptoms from short- and long-term exposure, and the numerical measures of toxicity [e.g., acute toxicity estimates such as the LD50 (median lethal dose, the estimated amount of a chemical expected to kill 50% of test animals in a single dose)].  This section also includes information on whether the chemical is considered as a potential carcinogen according to authoritative sources such as the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens and the International agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs.",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 9.0X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C for the unspecified dinonylphenol isomer indicates 2,4-dinonylphenol will exist in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase 2,4-dinonylphenol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 2,4-Dimethylphenol absorbs light with wavelengths >290 nm; by analogy 2,4-dinonylphenol may also absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm, and may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,4-dinonylphenol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.4X10+7. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. The estimated pKa of 2,4-dinonylphenol is 10.9, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in its unionized form in the environment. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected based on the estimated vapor pressure for 2,4-dinonylphenol. Biodegradation of 2,4-dinonylphenol may be similar to that of 4-nonylphenol, which, based on microcosm studies using six soils, was considered generally biodegradable in well-aerated, arable soils. If released into water, 2,4-dinonylphenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation of 2,4-dinonylphenol may be similar to that of nonylphenol, which was reported to have half-lives of 58 days in seawater and 28 to 104 days in mesocosm experiments using sediment. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hours and 10 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1.6X10+6 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2,4-dinonylphenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4-dinonylphenol is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of 2,4-dinonylphenol from moist soil surfaces is expected(SRC), given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), determined using a fragment constant estimation method(3). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). 2,4-Dinonylphenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an extrapolated vapor pressure for the unspecified dinonylphenol isomer of 9.0X10-10 mm Hg(4). The estimated pKa of 2,4-dinonylphenol is 10.9(5), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in its unionized form in the environment(SRC). Biodegradation of 2,4-dinonylphenol may be similar to that of 4-nonylphenol(SRC), which, based on microcosm studies using six soils, was considered generally biodegradable in well-aerated arable soils(6).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hours and 10 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1.6X10+6 years if adsorption is considered(5). The estimated pKa of 2,4-dinonylphenol is 10.9(6), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in its unionized form in the environment. According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3.2(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 10.5(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 2,4-Dinonylphenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(10). Biodegradation of 2,4-dinonylphenol may be similar to that of nonylphenol(SRC), which was reported to have half-lives of 58 days in seawater(11), and 28 to 104 days in mesocosm experiments using sediment(12).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

It is an anticonvulsant especially useful in the treatment of absence seizures unaccompanied by other types of seizures. [PubChem]Binds to T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels. Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the low-voltage activated (LVA) group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials and a voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the \"low-voltage activated (LVA)\" group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials and a voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes.",

The frequency of attacks is reduced by depression of nerve transmission in the motor cortex. These effects may be due to direct modification of membrane function in excitable cells and/or alteration of chemically mediated neurotransmission. The specific effect of ethosuximide against absence seizures appears to be due to its ability to block T-type calcium channels at concentrations that do not affect other ion channels. /Succinimide Anticonvulsants/",

The thalamus plays an important role in generation of 3 Hz spike-wave rhythms typical of absence seizures. Neurons in the thalamus exhibit a large amplitude T current spike that underlies bursts of action potentials and likely plays an important role in thalamic oscillatory activity such as 3 Hz spike-wave activity. At clinically relevant concentrations, ethosuximide inhibits the T current, as evident in voltage-clamp recordings in acutely isolated, ventrobasal thalamic neurons from rats and guinea pigs. Ethosuximide reduces this current without modifying the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation or the time course of recovery from inactivation. By contrast, succinimide derivatives with convulsant properties do not inhibit this current. Ethosuximide does not inhibit sustained repetitive firing or enhance GABA responses at clinically relevant concentrations. Current data are consistent with the idea that inhibition of T currents is the mechanism by which ethosuximide inhibits absence seizures.",

Some clinical observations show that it has secondary effects on the gastro intestinal tract (GIT). The present research tries to define the characteristics of Ethosuximide--the inducted secondary effects on the GIT, and to explain some of the possible mechanisms that cause them. The changes that occur in the GIT of patients cured with Ethosuximide are registered roentgenologically. The main change is the atony of the stomach and intestines and the reduced peristaltic activity. The influence of Ethosuximide is examined on smooth muscular samples of human stomach, taken in vitro using stomach resection. The medicament authoritatively reduce the spontaneous bioelectrical activity of the smooth muscular tissue, influences mainly it's components that have Ca+ nature. Together with that is indicated relaxation of the smooth muscular samples. In that research is expressed the thesis that this Ethosuximide reduction of the Ca(+)-influx in the smooth muscular cells and the related relaxation probably are one of the main reasons of the secondary effects on the GIT.",

Anticonvulsant agents are known to bring about changes in the functions and in the interaction between some of the mediator systems within the central nervous system. An assessment of the status of neuromediator systems can be made on the basis of the response of isolated smooth muscle strips to the action of agonists and antagonists of various receptors. It was found by the pharmacological analysis of isolated strips from the rat stomach (antrum and corpus strips), the seminal duct and the cervical vein that ethosuximide induces a reduction in the physical contractile activity and the tone of smooth muscle preparations. Smooth muscle relaxation caused by ethosuximide is not blocked by different receptor inhibitors such as dihydroergotamine, propranolol, atropine, chlorpromazine, haloperidol and indomethacin. Ethosuximide causes a significant reduction in the physical contraction of smooth muscles produced by potassium chloride depolarization, with a stronger impact on the subsequent tonic contraction caused by calcium ions. A reduction in the potassium content of the solution has no effect on the nature of the action of ethosutimide. It is thus assumed that the probable mechanism of action of ethosuximide consists in lowering calcium transport since the inhibitors of calcium transport sodium nitroprusside and verapamil intensify the blocking effect of ethosuximide on smooth muscle contractile activity.",

Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the \"low-voltage activated (LVA)\" group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials and a voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes.",

Clinically apparent hepatotoxicity from ethosuximide is very rare with few case reports published despite use of this agent for half a century. Futhermore, the liver injury in reported cases was usually mild and asymptomatic and a part of a generalized hypersensitivity syndrome with fever, rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, and eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytosis. The usual latency to onset of the hypersensitivity syndrome is 2 to 8 weeks. The typical serum enzyme elevations are a mixed-cholestatic-hepatocellular pattern and reported cases have not been jaundiced. While the product labeling for ethosuximide warns of hepatic dysfunction and recommends periodic monitoring of liver tests, clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice from ethosuximide is rare.",

The breast milk concentrations of ES were similar to those in maternal serum (milk/serum: 0.86 +/- 0.08, n = 12) and the nursed infants maintained serum levels between 15 and 40 ug/mL. Two major malformations (bilateral clefting, hare-lip) were observed in two neonates whose mothers received either ES/PB or ES/PMD comedication. The number of minor anomalies was higher in the ES group (6.2, n = 12) than in the pair-matched control group of infants born to non-epileptic mothers (2.1, n = 10).

Pinning behavior in the pups aged 4-5 weeks was significantly more frequent than that in age-matched controls. However, basal activity of open-field behavior and activity inhibited by diazepam administration in the pups aged 5-6 weeks showed no difference from the controls. The intensity of stereotyped behavior induced by apomorphine (1 mg/kg, SC) was significantly greater in the pups aged 5-6 weeks than in the controls. These results indicate that prenatal exposure to ethosuximide may cause changes in the dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

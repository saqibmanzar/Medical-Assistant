For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Significantly more black subjects had IGA success with adapalene-BPO than with vehicle at week 12. Significantly more black subjects also had decreased total, inflammatory, and noninflammatory lesion counts with adapalene-BPO that were seen as early as week 1. Adapalene-BPO was well tolerated in the black subjects included in this analysis and no cases of treatment-related PIH were observed. Similar results were obtained for this subgroup as the overall population from the 3 studies.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

In an in vitro diffusion system, statistically significant (p = 0.01) differences were found in the content of benzoyl peroxide in excised human skin and in percutaneous absorption. In vivo, significantly (p = 0.002) less benzoyl peroxide was absorbed through rhesus monkey skin from the polymeric system. This controlled release of benzoyl peroxide to skin can alter the dose relation that exists between efficacy and skin irritation. Corresponding studies showed reduced skin irritation in cumulative irritancy studies in rabbits and human beings, whereas in vivo human antimicrobial efficacy studies showed that application of the formulations containing entrapped benzoyl peroxide significantly reduced counts of Propionibacterium acnes (p less than 0.001) and aerobic bacteria (p less than 0.001) and the free fatty acid/triglyceride ratio in skin lipids. These findings support the hypothesis that, at least for this drug, controlled topical delivery can enhance safety without sacrificing efficacy.",

In vitro, the benzoyl peroxide penetrated into the skin, through the stratum corneum or the follicular openings, or both, and was recovered on the dermal side as benzoic acid. In vivo, benzoic acid was recovered from urine in amounts equivalent to 45% and 98% of the radiolabel following, respectively, topical and intramuscular administration of small amounts of (14)C-benzoyl peroxide. We conclude that benzoyl peroxide penetrates as such into the skin layers and is converted therein to benzoic acid, which, in turn is absorbed into the systemic circulation. Renal clearance of the metabolite is sufficiently rapid as to preclude its hepatic conjugation with glycine, since following topical administration to rhesus monkeys, no hippuric acid was found in the urine, as could have been expected had a significant amount of benzoic acid passed through the liver.",

The BPO in vitro absorbed by the skin was converted to benzoic acid preferably in the dermis. The portion penetrated through the skin was benzoic acid only. Also in patients treated with BPO, no BPO could be detected in the serum. These findings show that BPO as such is absorbed by the skin, but is systemically absorbed only after the metabolization to benzoic acid. Therefore a systemic-toxic effect in local therapy with BPO can be excluded.",

In vitro, the benzoyl peroxide penetrated into the skin, through the stratum corneum or the follicular openings, or both, and was recovered on the dermal side as benzoic acid. In vivo, benzoic acid was recovered from urine in amounts equivalent to 45% and 98% of the radiolabel following, respectively, topical and intramuscular administration of small amounts of (14)C-benzoyl peroxide. We conclude that benzoyl peroxide penetrates as such into the skin layers and is converted therein to benzoic acid, which, in turn is absorbed into the systemic circulation. Renal clearance of the metabolite is sufficiently rapid as to preclude its hepatic conjugation with glycine, since following topical administration to rhesus monkeys, no hippuric acid was found in the urine, as could have been expected had a significant amount of benzoic acid passed through the liver.",

Although not mutagenic, BzPO has been observed to produce strand breaks in DNA of exposed cells. These actions are presumed to be mediated by free-radical derivatives of BzPO. Previous studies suggested that the metabolism of BzPO in keratinocytes proceeds via the initial cleavage of the peroxide bond, yielding benzoyloxy radicals which, in turn, can either fragment to form phenyl radicals and carbon dioxide or abstract H atoms from biomolecules to yield benzoic acid. Benzoic acid is the major stable metabolite of BzPO produced by keratinocytes. In the present study we have investigated the role of BzPO and its metabolites in the generation of strand scissions in a cell-free system using phi X-174 plasmid DNA. In this system BzPO produced DNA damage that was dose-dependent over a concentration range of 0.1-1 mM and required the presence of copper but not other transition metals. By contrast, benoic acid did not produce DNA damage in this system, either in the presence or in the absence of copper. The inclusion of spin trapping agents, such as N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN), 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonate, and nitrosobenzene, in incubations was found to significantly reduce the extent of DNA damage generated via the copper-mediated activation of BzPO.

Acne is generally caused by increased excretion of sebum from pilosebaceous glands, endocrine factors such as androgenic hormones, keratin developing around follicles, bacterial growth, and inflammation. These factors contribute to the formation of comedones (whiteheads and blackheads).  The peroxide bond of benzoyl peroxide is cleaved to form 2 benzoyloxy radicals. These radicals interact nonspecifically with bacterial proteins, interfering with their function, and survival of the bacteria. Over time, free radical interactions with bacterial proteins lead to decreased keratin and sebum around follicles.  Benzoyl peroxide can also increase the turnover rate of epithelial cells, leading to skin peeling, and breaking down comedones.",

A linear correlation was observed between 0.002 g/L- 0.012 g/L of benzoyl peroxide. The detection limit was 0.005 g/kg.

Spectra of flour samples into which BPO were added were collected. Firstly, EMD was implemented to eliminate the noise of original spectra, and then SPA was employed to select the characteristic wavelengths. The precision of the model based on the processed spectra by EMD was greatly improved compared with the model based on the original spectra, with the calibration determination coefficient Rcal2 increased from 0.81 to 0.899 and the prediction determination coefficient R2pred increased from 0.7554 to 0.86. Seven characteristic variables were selected from 512 wavelength variables by SPA. And the performance of the model built by the selected characteristic variables (Rcal2 is 0.863, Rpred2 is 0.86) was as good as full-spectrum model's, while the number of modeling variables was greatly reduced by 96.4%. The results indicated that empirical mode decomposition and successive projections algorithm can be effectively used to denoise the spectra and selected characteristic wavelengths for the detection of BPO addition in flour. The seven selected wavelengths in this paper can be a reference for designing portable BPO detection meter.",

Medical studies have so far not confirmed that BP in wheat flour causes definite damage to the human body, but its main metabolite in the human body is benzoic acid. The addition of BP to wheat flour has been forbidden in China since 1 May 2011. It is therefore necessary to develop a suitable method to determine BP in wheat flour. A simple method using capillary electrophoresis (CE) was developed for determination of BP in wheat flour. BP was determined as benzoic acid after preceding reduction by potassium iodide. Separation was completed in less than 7 min with a running buffer of 10 mmol/L sodium borate (pH 9.18), 4 sec hydrodynamic injection, 25 kV separation voltage and UV detection at 228 nm. The method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, detection limit, precision and accuracy. The detection limit was 0.29 ug/mL. The method was successfully applied to the determination of BP in wheat flour samples, with recoveries between 96.1% and 102.6%. The performance of the CE method was comparable, and the quantitative results were in good agreement with those using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Meanwhile the proposed CE method has the advantages of better resolution, shorter analysis time and lower cost, and would be a good alternative to HPLC for routine monitoring of BP amount in wheat flour.",

Stir the dampened benzoyl peroxide with 10% sodium hydroxide solution (10 mL for each 1 g of peroxide) for 24 hours. The resultant sodium benzoate may be poured into the drain with at least 50 times its volume of water. Alternatively, react the dampened benzoyl peroxide with a solution of sodium or potassium iodide in acid. Gradually, and while stirring, add 1.0 g of peroxide to a solution of sodium iodide (1.4 g) or potassium iodide (1.5 g) in 28 mL of glacial acetic acid. The solution darkens rapidly due to formation of iodine. Allow to stand for 30 minutes. Add solid sodium metabisulfite until the solution is colorless. Wash the solution into the drain.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

A moisture content of 3% allowed slow burning only, and at 5% ignition did not occur [McCloskey, C. M. et al., Chem. Abs., 1967, 66, 12613c]. Mixed with a large surplus of water (30% or more), it is relatively safe. In dry form, it is a very dangerous material. It will explode spontaneously when heated above melting point (103 \u00b0C). An explosion which occurred when a screw-capped bottle of the peroxide was opened has been attributed to friction, which initiated a mixture of peroxide and organic dust in the cap threads [Lappin, G. R., Chem. Eng. News, 1948, 26, p.3518]. A violent explosion occurred during purification of the peroxide by Soxhlet extraction with hot chloroform [Anon., Sichere Chemiearb., 1976, 28, p. 49]. It is a powerful oxidizer, which ignites readily and burns rapidly. In contact with reducing agents, it may ignite by spontaneous chemical reaction. It must be kept in a cool place, in isolation and out of the sunlight or sources of heat. Also, avoid shock or friction. It reacts violently with inorganic or organic acids, alcohols, amines, metallic naphthenates and polymerization accelerators (e.g., N,N-dimethylaniline). Explosive or violent reaction upon contact with dimethyl sulfide, lithium aluminum hydride or aniline [Bretherick, 5th ed., 1995, p. 1140]. Mixture with carbon tetrachloride and ethylene explodes when exposed to heat [Bolt, R. O. et al., Chem. Eng. News, 1947, 25, p. 1866]. Ignition occurred upon contact with methyl methacrylate [MCA Case History No. 996], polymerization of vinyl acetate in ethyl acetate accelerated out of control leading to ignition and explosion [Vervalin, 1973, p. 81]. At 50 \u00b0C a mixture of dibenzoyl peroxide and charcoal reacts violently producing dense white smoke of benzoic acid, benzene, phenyls and carbon dioxide [Leleu, Cahiers, 1980, 99, p. 279].",

It has a population density of 1000 per square mile versus 26 for the entire State of Texas.  ... commercial quantities of peroxide are refrigerated continuously to prevent temperature increase and rapid decomposition.  Loss of refrigeration systems for an \"extended\" period of time can result in massive decomposition and fire in peroxide storage tanks. This is where things went wrong at the Arkema Corporation Plant that manufactures a large number of liquid organic peroxides in Crosby, Texas. Hurricane Harvey flooded this Plant where over one half million pounds of peroxides were stored.  Water destroyed the plant's electrical systems and backups thus shutting down refrigeration. \"Fearing that the chemicals might explode the Arkema workers, as a last resort, transferred the peroxides to nine refrigerated trailers on the property.  All but one of the refrigeration units on those trailers eventually failed, the company said.\" Out of fear of explosions the workers had to abandon the plant on August 29, resolved to allow explosions take place and peroxides burn. A perimeter of 1.5 miles around the plant was evacuated due to the various hazards. As time passed trailers warmed up and they exploded one by one and caught fire. Billowing thick black smoke and noxious gases were released every time a tanker exploded and burnt.  Scores of police officers and others were sent to hospital.",

It is used as a bleaching agent for flour, fats, oils, and waxes; polymerization catalyst; drying agent for unsaturated oils; pharmaceutical and cosmetic purposes; rubber vulcanization without sulfur; burnout agent for acetate yarns; production of cheese; and embossing vinyl flooring (proprietary). Its principal medical use is in the treatment of mild acne vulgaris (in which it is comedolytic) and acne rosacea, but it also is used in the treatment of decubital and stasis ulcers. HUMAN STUDIES: The only complications were contact irritant dermatitis in 3% and contact allergic dermatitis in 2% of patients treated with benzoyl peroxide. Potential symptoms of overexposure are irritation of skin, eyes, and mucous membranes, and sensitization dermatitis. Concentrations of 12.2 mg/cu m of air and higher resulted in pronounced irritation of the nose and throat. In the occupational setting it has produced allergic contact dermatitis in bakers. Benzoyl peroxide and Cu(I) induced 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) formation in double-stranded DNA more effectively than that in single-stranded DNA. Furthermore, benzoyl peroxide increased the amount of 8-oxodG in human cultured cells. ANIMAL STUDIES: Benzoyl peroxide dust irritates the eyes of rabbits if not washed out within five minutes after being placed in the conjunctival sac. Application of a 10% solution of benzoyl peroxide in propylene glycol to the skin of guinea-pigs resulted in slight to moderate erythema. A single application of either 20 or 40 mg benzoyl peroxide to the skin of mice induced marked hyperplasia and a temporary increase in the number of dark basal keratinocytes. Groups of 25 male and 25 female mice were fed a diet containing different doses of a commercial powder containing 18% benzoyl peroxide (calculated doses of benzoyl peroxide: 0, 28, 280 and 2800 ppm), for 80 weeks, at which time the number of survivors was 3, 10, 0 and 2 male mice and 9, 11, 9, and 11 females; all surviving animals were then killed. A few tumors at various sites were observed, but the overall tumor incidence did not differ significantly between treated and control groups. A group of 20 male rats received subcutaneous injections of 2.9 mg benzoyl peroxide into the right hind leg twice weekly for 12 weeks and were observed for 14 months, at which time all animals were still alive. No malignant tumor was found at the injection site or in internal organs. Benzoyl peroxide was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537, TA92, TA94, TA98 or TA100 either in the presence or absence of an exogenous metabolic system. Benzoyl peroxide did not induce polyploidy or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster lung cells. Benzoyl peroxide is a free radical generating compound that acts as a tumor promoter and progressor in mouse skin. Benzoyl peroxide at non-cytotoxic concentration undergoes copper dependent activation to a reactive product to generate 8-OHdG within cultured murine keratinocytes. Peroxides were tested for embryotoxicity in 3-day chicken embryos using the air-chamber method. All peroxides, including benzoyl peroxide, caused malformations at a moderate frequency. A comparison of the mechanism of action of benzoyl peroxide was studied in three different cell lines: NIH 3T3, HDCS and A431. Benzoyl peroxide was found to mediate its effect by inducing poly ADP-ribosylation in all the three cell types studied but to different extents, with histone H1 serving as a common acceptor for poly ADP-ribose. It also stimulated the activities of the antioxidant enzymes CuZn superoxide dismutase and catalase in NIH 3T3 and HDCS cells, but not in A431. Alterations in the expression of c-jun and c-fos were observed in NIH 3T3 and A431 cells. Benzoyl peroxide appeared to mediate its effect via genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.",

Female albino Swiss mice were overloaded with iron and tumors were initiated by applying a single topical application of DMBA. A week after the initiation, promoting agent, BPO, was applied three times/week for 46 weeks. The appearance of the first tumor (papilloma) and the number of tumors/mouse were recorded. When compared to the control group, the iron-overloaded mice showed an increased incidence of tumors at various time intervals. In iron-overloaded animals, tumors appeared earlier and also the number of tumors/mouse was significantly higher. These data could be correlated with the iron levels of mouse skin in the two groups. Further, BPO-mediated induction in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation in cutaneous DNA were higher in the iron overload group. In addition, in iron-overloaded mice, cutaneous lipid peroxidation (LPO) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) activities were higher, whereas catalase activity was reduced. Similar to papilloma induction, a significant increase in carcinoma yield and incidence was observed in iron-overloaded animals. Based on this study, we propose that iron overload significantly increases the tumor promotion and progression potential of BPO. We suggest that oxidative stress generated by iron overload is responsible for the augmentation of BPO-mediated cutaneous tumorigenesis.",

Topical antifungal therapies offer limited coverage of yeasts and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, the increased usage of these topical antimicrobial agents has resulted in the development of resistant cases. Benzoyl peroxide (BP), used in concert with antimicrobial agents containing an accessible tertiary amine, has previously been shown to increase radical activity and biological effect. /The study objective was/ to determine the applicability of using the tertiary amine terbinafine in concert with BP in dermatophyte and mixed skin infections by means of in vitro testing. In this preliminary in vitro study, the effect of BP, alone and in combination with terbinafine, was tested against Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus isolates following a checkerboard modification of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards M27-A2 and M7-A6. The individual minimum inhibitory concentrations of terbinafine, BP, and the combination, were determined against each isolate. The combination of BP with terbinafine led to additive activities against the majority of Candida albicans isolates tested and additionally expanded the bacterial coverage of terbinafine. The combination of antifungal agents bearing a tertiary amine with BP may have benefit in polymicrobial infections, given its wider antimicrobial coverage. Further appreciation of this mechanism of catalysis of BP radical formation by certain antimicrobials and other tertiary amine-containing compounds may lead to the discovery of improved treatments for several dermatological conditions.",

Stocks, an indigenous plant, in the modulation of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) treated and ultraviolet (UV) light irradiated tumor promotional events. BPO is a well-known tumor promoter while UV radiations are capable of acting as complete carcinogens. Treatment of the dorsal portions of the mice skins with BPO (20 mg/0.2 mL/animal) and subsequent UV irradiation (0.420 J/sq m/s) caused a significant depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), it's metabolizing and phase II enzymes (p < 0.01). Also, down regulation of the activities of antioxidant enzymes and up regulation of ornithine decarboxylase activity and enhancement in the synthesis of DNA, malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was observed. However, topical pretreatment with the extract of B. mukul not only restored the content of GSH, MDA and H(2)O(2) but it also recovered the activities of above-mentioned enzymes (p < 0.05) and prevented synthesis of DNA (p < 0.05) significantly. Although the lower dose was not very effective, the higher dose showed promising results against oxidative stress and hyperproliferative response of BPO and UVB radiations. From the present data we conclude that B. mukul is potentially strong enough to modulate the events of skin tumor promotion.",

Benzoyl peroxide treatment (20 mg/animal/0.2 mL acetone) and UVB radiation (0.420 J/sq m/s) caused a decrease in the activities of cutaneous antioxidant enzymes namely, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phase II metabolizing enzyme such as glutathione-S-transferase and quinone reductase and depletion in the level of cutaneous glutathione. There was also enhancement in cutaneous microsomal lipid peroxidation, xanthine oxidase activity, [(14)C]-ornithine decarboxylase activity and [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation into cutaneous DNA. Cycloartenol was topically applied prior to the application of benzoyl peroxide at dose levels of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg/kg body weight in acetone, which resulted in significant inhibition of epidermal ornithine decarboxylase activity and DNA synthesis (P < 0.001). There was also significant reduction of lipid peroxidation and xanthine oxidase activity (P < 0.001). In addition, the depleted levels of glutathione, inhibited activities of antioxidant and phase II metabolizing enzymes, were also recovered to a significant level (P < 0.001). The data indicate that cycloartenol is an effective chemopreventive agent in skin carcinogenesis.",

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a once-daily topical application of BPO 3% gel versus an inert vehicle gel in Japanese acne patients. Three hundred and sixty patients were randomized to receive BPO 3% or vehicle for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end-point was absolute change in number of total lesions (TL) from baseline to week 12 to demonstrate the superiority of BPO 3% versus vehicle. Secondary efficacy end-points were absolute and percent change in TL, inflammatory lesions (IL), non-inflammatory lesions (non-IL) and Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA). Change in TL counts from baseline to week 12 for BPO 3% was superior to vehicle (difference, -21.0; P < 0.001). Absolute and percent reductions in TL, IL and non-IL counts were greater for BPO 3% at all study visits. The proportion of patients with improvement in ISGA scores was significantly higher with BPO 3% than with vehicle from week 2. All adverse events were mild or moderate. Adverse drug-related reactions were higher for BPO 3% (30%) than with vehicle (5%). Local tolerability scores of grade 1 or more (slight to moderate) were more frequent with BPO 3% than vehicle with the most significant differences observed in dryness (56% vs 27% at week 1-4), peeling (19% vs 9% at week 1-2) and burning/stinging (58% vs 15% at week 1-12). These results indicate that BPO 3% is effective while maintaining a favorable safety and tolerability profile in Japanese acne patients.",

Most frequently, positive reactions occurred to cadmium chloride in both groups. However, there was no evidence at all for relevance of these reactions. Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) ranked 2nd in patch test positivity. Although not statistically significant, reactions were more frequent in dental technicians, who might be exposed to BPO the in working environment. Methyl methacrylate (MMA) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) were common sensitizers in dental technicians but not in other patients. This finding, too, has its explanation in the working process of manufacturing dental prostheses.",

One recommendation was that there should be an increased emphasis on short-term tests to detect agents that do not exert genetic effects such as some promoting agents. Initiation/promotion models have been used routinely to identify chemicals with promoting potential and to study tumorigenesis. In one model, a topical subcarcinogenic dose of a chemical is first applied to the back of the skin (initiation) followed by repeated topical applications of one or more chemicals (promotion) and the skin is monitored for tumor development. Mouse skin has been shown to be more responsive (i.e., develops tumors using this protocol) than other commonly used laboratory rodent models. However, not all mouse strains are equally sensitive. The skin tumor response of the B6C3F1 mouse using the initiation/promotion protocol was not known. Since the B6C3F1 mouse is commonly used in NTP carcinogenesis studies and much is known of its biology and response to chemical carcinogens, known initiators and promoters were used to compare the tumor response sensitivity of B6C3F1 mouse skin to that of two often-used responsive strains, Swiss (CD-1) and SENCAR mice. The combination of 7,12- dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) initiation and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) promotion was selected because this pair is routinely used to study tumorigenesis. However, DMBA requires metabolic activation to achieve initiation and it was possible that the B6C3F1 mouse metabolism might not make this conversion. Therefore, a second study was conducted using N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), a direct acting carcinogen, as the initiator. MNNG is not used as frequently for mouse skin studies as is DMBA. In addition to the promoter TPA, benzoyl peroxide (BPO), a non-phorbol ester and known promoter after DMBA initiation, was also used. Each initiating chemical was used in combination with each promoting chemical ... /(Groups of 30 male and 30 female mice (all strains) were administered 2.5 or 25 pg DMBA once in the first week of the study followed by 20 mg BPO once per week for the remaining 51 weeks. Groups of 30 male and 30 female mice (all strains) were administered 100, 500, or 1,000 ug MNNG as an initiator in a single dose during week 1, followed by 20 mg BPO as a promoter treatment once per week for the remaining 51 weeks of the study.)/.  Additional groups of male and female mice of each strain were treated with repeated applications of acetone (vehicle control), repeated applications of promoter (TPA or BPO) without prior initiation treatment (promoter reference controls), or a single application of the initiator (DMBA or MNNG) followed by repeated applications of acetone (initiator controls). All three strains of mice demonstrated sensitivity by developing skin tumors after topical application of the chemicals under study (DMBA, MNNG, TPA, and BPO). The most sensitive of the three strains appeared to be SENCAR mice, in the sense that lower doses of the test chemical were generally required to produce effects equivalent to those in the other two strains. Skin tumors also tended to develop earlier and with greater multiplicity in SENCAR mice than in the other two strains. By these criteria, the overall sensitivity of Swiss (CD-1) mice was intermediate, and B6C3F1 mice showed the least overall sensitivity to dermal carcinogenicity. In response to recommendations regarding specific short-term tests and also on the skin tumor response sensitivity of various initiators and promoters, SENCAR mice would be the most acceptable strain to use for such studies. Though the B6C3F1 mice were less responsive in the skin initiation/promotion protocol, promotion data from this strain may, at times, be of more use in explaining mechanisms of tumor development (e.g. when there is a strain specific response observed in 2-year carcinogenicity studies or effects on melanocytes are suspected). The 1-year complete carcinogen studies used repeated applications of low concentrations of the carcinogens DMBA and MNNG. The skin tumor response in all three strains under these conditions was more similar than in the initiation and promotion studies. There was a high incidence of skin tumors in all three strains with both carcinogens. More B6C3F1, and SENCAR mice developed skin tumors and averaged more tumors per mouse than did Swiss (CD-1) mice. Skin tumors developed earlier in SENCAR mice than in B6C3F1 and Swiss (CD-1) mice. Although B6C3F1 mice exhibited the lowest overall sensitivity to the initiation/promotion protocol when compared to Swiss (CD-1) and SENCAR mice, the response of B6C3F1 mice was similar to Swiss (CD-1) and SENCAR mice for complete carcinogen studies.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.0X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibenzoyl peroxide will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dibenzoyl peroxide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.5 days. Particulate-phase dibenzoyl peroxide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Dibenzoyl peroxide absorbs light at a maximum of 275 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dibenzoyl peroxide is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 92. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Dibenzoyl peroxide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 84% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 3 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, dibenzoyl peroxide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 120 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 89 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis half-lives at pH 7 and 8 have been estimated to be 2 minutes and 13 seconds, respectively. Occupational exposure to dibenzoyl peroxide may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dibenzoyl peroxide is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dibenzoyl peroxide via inhalation of vapors, and dermal contact with consumer products containing dibenzoyl peroxide.

Vapor-phase dibenzoyl peroxide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.5 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.6X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase dibenzoyl peroxide may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC).

These reactions also liberate heat, thus further accelerating the decomposition. Commercial products often contain diluents that desensitize neat peroxides to these hazards.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 16 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 120 days(SRC). Dibenzoyl peroxide's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Dibenzoyl peroxide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 7.0X10-5 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(1).",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

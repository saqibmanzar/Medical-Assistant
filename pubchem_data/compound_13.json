When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For 2 days after 8 hr exposure, half-time of elimination of (14)C from muscle & liver was 0.4 days, while after 35 day exposure an early rapid elimination of (14)C from these tissues (half-time= 0.4 days) was followed by slower elimination (half-time= 50 days) during days 4-36. Values for bile were much greater, reaching 240 after 8 hr exposure & 1400 during the 35 day exposure. When larger trout & carp were exposed to (0.2-0.4 mg/L), the bioconcentration factor for bile (14)C to water (14)C was less than 100. Pretreatment of trout with beta-naphthoflavone, an inducer of hepatic mixed-function oxidase, incr this bioconcentration factor for bile to several hundred. Solvent partitioning and thin layer chromatography indicated that about 60% of (14)C in bile from control trout or carp was present as highly polar biotransformation products, while for induced trout the value was more than 90%.",

About 10% of all metabolites became covalently bound to protein in a rather nonselective way. For 1,2,4-TrCB ... a strong correlation between secondary metabolism to hydroquinones and covalent binding was established. Protein binding was completely inhibited by the addition of ascorbic acid, indicating quinone metabolites as the sole reactive species formed. 1,2,4-TrCB ... alkylated DNA, although to a much lesser extent than protein (0.5% ... of all metabolites). Nonquinone intermediates, presumably epoxides, were responsible for a minor portion of the observed DNA binding, since complete inhibition by ascorbic acid was not reached. The differential role of cytochrome P450 both in primary and in secondary metabolism was demonstrated by the use of microsomes from rats pretreated with different inducers. Dexamethasone (DEX) microsomes (cytochrome P450IIIA1) showed the highest activity toward these chlorinated benzenes (14 nmol/mg/5 min for 1,2,4-TrCB ...  both with regard to the formation of phenols and to the formation of protein-bound metabolites. In addition, DEX microsomes preferentially formed 2,3,6-trichlorophenol, whereas other microsomal suspensions formed 2,4,5-trichlorophenol as the major isomer. The present study clearly demonstrates the high alkylating potency of secondary quinone metabolites derived from chlorinated benzenes and poses a need for reevaluation of the role of epoxides in the observed toxicity of these compounds.",

After the administration of 1,2,4-TCB to rats, swift decreases in concentrations of 1,2,4-TCB in blood, liver, kidneys, and adipose tissue were observed. On the other hand, 2,3,5-TCPSO2Me appeared in blood, liver, kidneys, and adipose tissue and remained detectable in the blood and the three tissues until 120 hr. The increases in the activities of aminopyrine N-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase and the contents of cytochromes P450 and b5 in hepatic microsomes produced by 1,2,4-TCB occurred after increases in the hepatic concentration of 2,3,5-TCSO2Me. 2,3,5- and 2,4,5-TCPSO2Me increased the above four parameters in rat liver microsomes. The inducing intensity of 2,3,5-TCPSO2Me was much higher than that of 2,4,5-TCPSO2Me. 2,3,5-TCPSO2Me was considered to be a potent inducer and to play a principal role in the induction by 1,2,4-TCB. When 1,2,4-TCB was injected ip into bile duct-cannulated rats, little 2,3,5-TCPSO2Me was detected in blood, liver, kidneys, and adipose tissue. In the antibiotic-pretreated rats dosed with 1,2,4-TCB, 2,3,5-TCPSO2Me concentrations in the blood and the three tissues markedly decreased. These findings suggest that the formation of methylsulfonyl metabolites from 1,2,4-TCB depends largely upon the metabolism of some precursor(s) excreted in the bile by intestinal microflora. The increasing effects of 1,2,4-TCB administration on the activities of aminopyrine- and aniline-metabolizing enzymes and the contents of cytochromes P450 and b5 in hepatic microsomes were not observed in the bile duct-cannulated rats. These findings provide evidence that the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes by 1,2,4-TCB is not due to the action of 1,2,4-TCB itself but is due to its methylsulfonyl metabolite, 2,3,5-TCPSO2Me.",

Production method applicable to 1,2,4- and 1,2,3-trichlorobenzenes is based on the dehydrohalogenation of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane (stereoisomeric mixture), a byproduct of  gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane production. In the presence of aqueous alkali or alkaline earth solutions or of ammonia, or directly through use of catalysts, hexachlorocyclohexane is converted at a temperature of 90 - 250 \u00b0C mainly to trichlorobenzene. The yield lies between 80 and 99%, with the product mixture consisting of 70 - 85% 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and 13 - 30% 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

One mmol/kg of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (p-dichlorobenzene), 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, 1,4-dibromobenzene, 1,2,4-tribromobenzene, or hexabromobenzene or 0.1 mmol/kg hexachlorobenzene was administered po to male mice daily for 7 days. In general, the trihalogenated benzenes increased the LD50 of all 4 insecticides 2- to 6-fold. These increases were larger than those observed with the di- or hexahalogenated isomers. The bromide-substituted benzenes were usually more active than the chlorinated ones with the exception being hexabromobenzene. There was a good correlation between their effects on lethality and increases in in vitro carboxylesterase activity with either malathion or malaoxon as the substrate. The trihalogenated benzenes decreased the inhibitory effect of malathion on cholinesterase activity in the brain and to a lesser degree in the red blood cells, but not in liver or plasma. There was also a good correlation between protection against parathion and paraoxon lethality, protection against inhibition of cholinesterase in the brain and liver by paraoxon, and increases in the dealkylation of paraoxon by microsomal mixed-function oxidases but not by hepatic or plasma esterases. It appears that the halogenated benzenes are able to protect against organophosphorus insecticide toxicity. With malathion, increases in carboxylesterase activity may be important, and with paraoxon, increases in microsomal mixed-function oxidase dealkylation and tissue binding cannot be excluded from contributing to the protection seen.",

Toxic effects on the liver, the kidneys, and the thyroid were monitored after a single ip administration of 1, 2, or 4 mmol/kg monochlorobenzene (MCB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DICB), 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DICB), 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TRCB), and pentachlorobenzene (PECB). Due to its low solubility, 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene (1,2,4,5-TECB) was tested at a highest dose of 0.8 mmol/kg. 1,2-DICB and 1,2,4-TRCB produced the most severe hepatotoxic effects when compared with an equimolar dose of the other chlorinated benzenes, as determined by plasma ALT profile and histopathological changes after 72 hr. MCB was considerably less hepatotoxic. Severe degenerative damage to the kidney was only observed in a few rats treated with 1,2,4-TRCB. However, protein droplets in the tubular epithelial cells were observed at 72 hr after administration of 1,4-DICB, 1,2,4-TRCB, 1,2,4,5-TECB, and PECB. In the latter two groups, these protein droplets were still observed 9 days after administration. All chlorinated benzenes tested excluding MCB induced a reduction in plasma thyroxine levels. The extent of decrease in plasma thyroxine was more severe in rats treated with 1,2,4-TRCB or PECB and correlated well with the relative binding affinities of the phenolic metabolites to the plasma transport protein for thyroxine, ie, transthyretin. The present study indicates that the establishment of a structure-activity relationship with regard to toxicity depends on the sensitivity of the respective target organs. In the series of (poly)chlorinated benzenes studied, ranging from mono- to pentachlorobenzene, the most severe effects on liver, kidney, and thyroid were observed for 1,2,4-substitution.",

The most toxic compounds were pentachlorophenol and atrazine, whereas benzene, trichloroethylene, styrene-7,8-oxide, hexachlorobenzene, 1,1-dichloroethylene, and 4-nitrophenol were only slightly toxic. Tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate, thiourea, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, 4-chloroaniline, lindane, and 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile were of intermediate toxicity.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.46 mm Hg at 25deg C indicates 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 30 days. The half-life of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene in surface waters, when exposed to summer sunlight at 40 deg latitude, was calculated as 450 years, suggesting that the compound is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene is expected to have moderate to no mobility based upon Koc values of 440 to 10,715. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an  important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.42X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene is expected to biodegrade slowly in soils, with biodegradation half-lives ranging from several weeks to a few months. If released into water, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. The aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation half-lives of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene in natural waters was reported as 28 and 110 days, respectively. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.8 hours and 5.6 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is up to 86 days when adsorption is considered. Measured BCF values of 120 in carp to 57,544 in Atlantic croaker suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. A hydrolysis half-life was given as 3.4 years for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. Occupational exposure to 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,2,4-1,2,4-trichlorobenzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound or other products containing 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene.

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.8 hours and 5.6 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is up to 86 days when adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values of 120 in carp(8) to 57,544 in Atlantic croaker(2), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). A hydrolysis half-life was given as 3.4 years for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene(2).

Vapor-phase 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 30 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.3X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The half-life of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene in surface waters, when exposed to summer sunlight at 40 deg latitude, was calculated as 450 years(4), suggesting that the compound is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Sediment from freshwater streams in the Netherlands degraded 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, with reported biodegradation half-lives of 50-212 days(3). An enriched microbial culture derived from sediment of the Rhine River reductively dechlorinated 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to 1,2-dichlorobenzene in about 1 year following a lag period of over 138 days(4). The anaerobic biodegradation half-life of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene in natural waters has been reported as 110 days(5). Sediment from the Ise Bay, Japan reductively dechlorinated 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at a rate of 15-35 pmols/day, with the main degradation product reported as 1,2-dichlorobenzene(6). 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene, under methanogenic conditions, degraded >99% in Rhine sediment taken near Nieuwegein and dune sediment taken near Zandvoort, Netherlands(7). 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene was biodegraded 11% in groundwater samples under anaerobic conditions(8). Anaerobic biodegradation rates for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene have been given as 0.0062 and 0.0096/day(9). 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene was anaerobically biodegraded 50% in <4 days(10).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4.8 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 5.6 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is up to 86 days when adsorption is considered(3). 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.46 mm Hg(4).",

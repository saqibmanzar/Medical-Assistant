For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

BCEE is distributed through the body, but highest levels are found in the liver, kidney and small intestine, while much lower levels are found in lung, spleen and muscle. BCEE is extensively metabolized to thiodiglycolic acid (TDGA), 2-chloroethoxyacetic acid (CEAA), and N-acetyl-S-[2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethyl]-L-cysteine, with TDGA being the principal endproduct. Smaller amounts of BCEE are metabolized by oxidation or substitution at a chlorine without ether cleavage. Approximately 80% of BCEE administered orally is excreted as TDGA within 48 hours. Smaller amounts are excreted in feces or expired air and only a very small fraction of the dose remains in the body. This indicates that BCEE is effectively excreted, and that it has a low tendency to accumulate in tissues. (L183, A129)",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.55 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bis(2-chloroethyl) ether will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase bis(2-chloroethyl) ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days. If released to soil, bis(2-chloroethyl) ether is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 120. It may be resistant to biodegradation in environmental media based upon screening test data from studies using activated sludge. Many ethers are known to be resistant to biodegradation. In one study, bis(2-chloroethyl) ether showed 50% biodegradation after 30 days when incubated with Ohio River water; acclimation appears to be important. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.9X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, bis(2-chloroethyl) ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based on the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based on its estimated Henry's Law constant. The volatilization half-life from a model river and a model lake is estimated as approximately 40 hours and 16 days, respectively. A BCF of 0.4 to 11 suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The hydrolysis half-life for bis(2-chloroethyl) ether in water was determined to be 3 years in one study and 22 years in demineralized water in another study. 2-(2-Chloroethoxy) ethanol and diethylene glycol were determined to be the major hydrolysis by-products of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether. Direct photolysis in the atmosphere is not expected to be a major significant degradation process since no functional groups are present in bis(2-chloroethyl) ether that would lead to absorption of sunlight. The most probable routes of general population exposure to bis(2-chloroethyl) ether are inhalation of contaminated air and ingestion of contaminated drinking water. Exposure through dermal contact may occur in occupational settings. Inhalation and dermal exposure would have been expected to be highest in workplaces where bis(2-chloroethyl) ether is made and used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether from moist soil surfaces is expected to be important(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.9X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its vapor pressure(4) and water solubility(5). In a 140 cm long column containing Lincoln fine sand collected in Ada, OK, 86% of the applied bis(2-chloroethyl) ether reached 140 cm, indicating minimal adsorption to this soil(6). The potential for volatilization of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based on a vapor pressure of 1.55 mm Hg(4). No data concerning the hydrolysis of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether in soil were available. The hydrolysis rate constant for bis(2-chloroethyl) ether in water was determined to be 2.6X10-5/hour under neutral conditions; this corresponds to a half-life at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C of 3 years(7). Bis(2-chloroethyl) ether may be resistant to biodegradation under aerobic conditions in environmental media based upon screening test data from studies using activated sludge(8,RC). In one study, bis(2-chloroethyl) ether showed 50% biodegradation after 30 days when incubated with Ohio River water; acclimation appears to be important(9). In general, many ethers are known to be resistant to biodegradation(10).",

Bis(2-chloroethyl) ether is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.9X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its vapor pressure(4) and water solubility(5). Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 40 hours and 16 days, respectively(3,SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF of 0.4 to 1.3(7) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). In one study, bis(2-chloroethyl) ether showed 50% biodegradation after 30 days when incubated with Ohio River water; acclimation appears to be important(8). Bis(2-chloroethyl) ether may be resistant to biodegradation under aerobic conditions in environmental media based upon screening test data from studies using activated sludge(7,SRC). In general, many ethers are known to be resistant to biodegradation(9). The hydrolysis rate constant for bis(2-chloroethyl) ether in water was determined to be 2.6X10-5/hour under neutral conditions; this corresponds to a half-life at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C of 3 years(10). The hydrolysis half-life of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether in demineralized water at 25 \u00b0C was determined to be 22 years(11). 2-(2-Chloroethoxy) ethanol and diethylene glycol were determined to be the major hydrolysis by-products of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether(12).",

Vapor-phase bis(2-chloroethyl) ether is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days(3,SRC). Direct photolysis in the atmosphere is not expected to be a major significant degradation process since no functional groups are present in bis(2-chloroethyl) ether that would lead to absorption of sunlight(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

After a second addition of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether, only 9-10 days were required to observe 50% recovery of theoretical carbon dioxide, suggesting acclimation was necessary for optimal biodegradation rates(1). The absence of evidence of biodegradation in another study(2) may be attributed to an insufficiently long acclimation period (18 days)(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

These data are contained in the STORET data base and only an unspecified portion pertains to surface water(1). Trace concns of bis(2-chloroethyl) ether were found in five surface water samples taken from sites along the Delaware River in March 1977; no bis(2-chloroethyl) ether was detected in 11 surface water samples taken from the river in August 1976(2). The bis(2-chloroethyl) ether concn in three samples of surface water taken from New Orleans and Baton Rouge ranged from 0.040-0.16 ug/l with a mean bis(2-chloroethyl) ether concn of 0.11 ug/l; one surface water sample taken in the Houston area contained 1.4 ug/l(3). Raw water samples collected in unspecified locations in the United Kingdom contained bis(2-chloroethyl) ether, but no quantitative data were presented(4). Bis(2-chloroethyl) ether was identified but not quantified in bank-filtered Rhine water(5). Bis(2-chloroethyl) ether was identified in an aqueous sample collected near Quantico, VA as having a concn <2 ug/l(6). The concn of stormwater detected in roof areas, parking areas, street runoff, vehicle service areas, landscaped areas, urban creeks, and detention ponds of Birmingham, Al averaged 42, 20, 15, 45, 23, 200, and 15 ug/l, respectively(4). Bis(2-chloroethyl)ether was qualitatively detected on-site and off-site at the Lipari Landfill Superfund site, Gloucester County, New Jersey in surface water samples collected from 1983-1984(7).",

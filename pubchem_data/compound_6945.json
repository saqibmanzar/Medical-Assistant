They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

(14)C labeled 2-chloronitrobenzene or 4-chloronitrobenzene was applied to the shaved backs of male Fischer 344 rats at an application rates equivalent to doses of 0, 0.65, 6.5 or 65 mg/kg. Urine and feces samples were collected for 24, 48 or 72 hr and assayed for (14)C activity. Exhaled volatiles were collected in ethanol traps and analyzed. After 72 hr, the rats were /sacrificed/ and their skin removed and analyzed for (14)C activity. Approx 21-27% and 43 to 45% of the 2-chloronitrobenzene and 4-chloronitrobenzene doses, respectively, were eliminated in the urine over 72 hr. Approx 11 to 15% of the 2-chloronitrobenzene dose and 5 to 12% of the 4-chloronitrobenzene dose were excreted over 72 hr. Fecal excretion of 4-chloronitrobenzene showed a dose related incr which was statistically significant only when comparing the 65 mg/kg dose with the 0.65 mg/kg dose. Approx 27 to 32% of 2-chloronitrobenzene derived radioactivity and 13 to 15% of the 4-chloronitrobenzene derived (14)C activity were recovered in the ethanol traps. The amt of collected radioactivity did not depend on dose and consisted of unchanged 2-chloronitrobenzene or 4-chloronitrobenzene. ... An analysis of all (14)C data indicated that the dermal absorption of 2-chloronitrobenzene ... was linear over the entire dose range. Dermal absorption of 4-chloronitrobenzene was linear only after application of 0.65 and 6.5 mg/kg. /Results indicate/ that under the experimental conditions used at least 33 to 40% and 51 to 62% of the applied 2-chloronitrobenzene and 4-chloronitrobenzene doses, respectively, are absorbed from the skin of rats. ... Dermal absorption of 2-chloronitrobenzene is linear over the dose range 0.65 mg/kg to 65 mg/kg. Dermal absorption of 4-chloronitrobenzene is essentially unaffected by dose.",

For doses ranging from 0.65 to 65 mg/kg of either chemical, 33%; to 40%; of 2-chloronitrobenzene and 51%; to 62%; of 4-chloronitrobenzene were absorbed under nonocclusive conditions.

Rat studies with labelled chemical show that 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene absorption is 80% following oral administration and at least 40% after open dermal application. 0n 11 consecutive days, 65 mg 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene/kg bw was administered by gavage to adult and to old rats. On days 1, 5, and 9 applied substance was labelled and urine and feces were collected in the following 96 hours. The adult rats excreted 71-74% of the dose in the urine and 20-27% of the dose in the feces. Excretion rate increased with the duration of treatment. Urinary excretion rate in the old rats consisted 71-85% of the dose and did not increase with the duration of treatment. The radioactivity level in the tissues were determined 72 hours after d9-treatment and shown to be found 5% of the dose in adult rats and 8% in the old rats. At very high doses, e.g. 200 mg/kg bw given orally, urinary excretion is delayed and fecal excretion is markedly suppressed. There is evidence to suggest involvement of the enterohepatic cycle, but there are no signs of accumulation of 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene or one of its metabolites.",

After 90 min., 71% of the o-chloronitrobenzene had been metabolized; the primary metabolic pathway for o-chloronitrobenzene was reduction to o-chloroaniline (19.2% of the total radioactivity); o-chloronitrobenzene was also conjugated with glutathione; two other very polar metabolites, comprising 14.2% of the total 14C from o-chloronitrobenzene, have not been identified. in order to identify the specific enzymes involved in the metabolism of o-chloronitrobenzene by isolated rat hepatocytes, hepatic subcellular fractions were isolated from rats; microsomes incubated with radiolabelled (14C) o-chloronitrobenzene in the presence of NADPH produced o-chloroaniline under aerobic conditions and SKF 525 A and metyrapone had no effect on the metabolism to o-chloroaniline: these findings suggest that cytochrome P-450 reductase is responsible for o-chloronitrobenzene reduction; radiolabelled o-chloronitrobenzene was also incubated with or without microsomes, cytosol and/or glutathione: o-chloronitrobenzene was converted to S-(2-nitrophenyl)glutathione in the presence of cytosol and glutathione suggesting that cytosolic glutathione transferase is involved in this conjugation (concentration of the test substance unspecified).",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Due to the limited and poor quality information available regarding skin sensitization, it cannot be concluded whether or not the chemical has a sensitizing activity. Target organs of repeated dose toxicity in rats and mice are blood, liver, kidney and spleen with methemogobinemia as the most sensitive parameter. The repeated dose toxicity was examined in rats and in mice for a period of 13 weeks via whole body inhalation. The NOAEL in rats was not achieved, the LOAEL is 1.1 ppm (7 mg/cu m). In mice, increased liver and kidney weights were observed even at 1.1 ppm and respectively 2.3 ppm. The NOAEL for histopathological injury in mice is 4.5 ppm (28.8 mg/cu m). In a subacute feeding study with mice the NOAEL was 50 ppm (males: 16 mg/kg bw/day; females: 24 mg/kg bw/day). 1-Chloro-2-nitrobenzene showed weak mutagenic activity in bacterial test systems but not in mammalian cell test systems in vitro. It was not mutagenic in Drosophila melanogaster . In mammalian cells in vitro, it showed weak clastogenic activity. The substance induced increased rates of Sister Chromatid Exchanges, whereas the biological relevance of this effect is not yet clear. Intraperitoneal injection into mice resulted in DNA damage in the liver and kidney. The inconsistent results of the available genotoxic studies are typical for nitroaromatics. As a whole 1- chloro-2-nitrobenzene is suspected of being genotoxic, at least a weak clastogen. 1-Chloro-2-nitrobenzene induced tumors in different organs of rats and in the liver of mice. Based on the available studies, which have methodological deficiencies, there is a concern for a carcinogenic potential of 1-chloro-2- nitrobenzene. Following inhalative exposure of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice for 13 weeks, only in males 1- chloro-2-nitrobenzene affects the reproductive organs. Performance of a specific study on toxicity to reproduction (NTP continuous breeding protocol) reveals that 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene was without reproductive toxicity in a different mice strain following oral treatment by gavage despite of significant changes in liver and spleen weight and despite of elevated methaemoglobin levels. Thus, the NOAEL fertility in Swiss CD-1 mice after oral application is 160 mg/kg bw/day whereas the dams showed general toxicity effects at this concentration. Because 1-choro-2- nitrobenzene affected the reproductive organs in systemic toxic doses in male rats and in males of one strain of mice after subchronic inhalation there is a concern for a reproductive toxicity potential, even if an impairment of reproduction after oral administration in males of a second strain of mice could not be detected. Developmental toxicity was examined by two studies with Sprague-Dawley rats which have methodology deficiencies. In one study, due to high mortality rate at the highest dose level, only two doses could be evaluated. NOAEL maternal toxicity is 25 mg/kg bw/day, a NOAEL developmental toxicity could not be conclusively derived since there was an increase in the number of litters exhibiting specific skeletal variations. In the second study only one dose was applied: NOAEL developmental toxicity is 100 mg/kg bw/day, a NOAEL maternal toxicity could not be derived. Based on the available studies the overall conclusion is, that there is no indication of developmental toxicity, although there are some limitations within the studies. Environment: ...  The acute toxicity has been determined for: fish (Cyprinus carpio) with a 96 hr-LC50 of 25.5 mg/L; daphnia (Daphnia magna) with a 24 hr-EC50of 12 mg/L and a 48 hr-EC50 of 23.9 mg/L, and Daphnia carinata with a 48 hr-EC50 of 21.3 mg/L; algae (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) with a 96 hr-EbC50 of 6.9 mg/L. With another alga species (Secendesmus subspicatus) a 48 hr-ErC50 of 75 mg/L and a 48h-ErC10 of 19 mg/L was found. Chronic toxicity has been tested for Daphnia magna with a 21 d-NOEC of 3 mg/L on reproduction (measured concentration) and for fish (Pimephales promelas) in an Early Life Stage Test with a 33 d-NOEC of 0.264 mg/L concerning the endpoint normal larvae (measured concentration). A PNECaqua of 0.026 mg/L is derived using an assessment factor of 10. In a test with terrestrial plants a 14 d-EC50 in the range of 3.2 - 10 mg/kg soil dry weight was determined for Lactuca sativa regarding the endpoint of growth. APNECsoil of 3.2 ug/kg bw was derived from this value using an assessment factor of 1000.",

Based on this preliminary suggestion of effect, 2CNB was tested for its effects on fertility & reproduction in Swiss CD-l mice according to the Continuous Breeding Protocol. Because inhalation Continuous Breeding studies are currently prohibitively expensive, 2CNB was administered via gavage. In Task 1, dose levels of 20, 40, 80, 160, & 320 mg/kg/day were used. All animals in the high dose group died or were moribund & sacrificed. Animals in the 160 mg/kg/day group acclimated to the effects of 2CNB, & no animals died. The following dose levels were chosen for Task 2: 0, 40, 80 & 160 mg/kg bw. Male & female mice (F0) were continuously exposed for a 7-day pre cohabitation & a 98-day cohabitation period. In the final litter of the holding period following the continuous breeding phase, pup weight gain during suckling was lower in the treated groups. At weaning, pups in the 160 mg/kg group weighed 12% less than controls. All other fertility & reproductive parameters were not affected. F0 animals in the 160 mg/kg group had increased body & spleen weights & were methemoglobinemic. F1 animals (160 mg/kg) had significantly lower body weights at weaning but were significantly heavier than controls at mating & terminal necropsy. Spleen & liver weights were also increased in the treated F1 animals at necropsy, & blood analysis showed significant methemoglobinemia. Seminal vesicle-to-body weight ratio was significantly decreased in the F1 males. None of the fertility & reproductive parameters examined were affected by 2CNB treatment in F1 animals. Overall, 2-chloronitrobenzene is not a reproductive toxicant, even in the presence of systemic toxicity, in Swiss CD-l mice.",

Animals were evaluated for histopathology, clinical chemistry (rats), hematology (rats), and reproductive system effects. In separate studies, the dermal absorption of the chemicals was compared, and the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion were partially characterized following oral administration to male F344/N rats. 2-Chloronitrobenzene and 4-chloronitrobenzene were also administered orally to CD-1 Swiss mice for evaluation of reproductive and developmental toxicity. ... The highest exposure concentrations used in the 2-wk and 13-wk studies were limited by technical factors in vapor generation to 18 ppm (115.2 mg/cu m) for 2-chloronitrobenzene... . Other concentrations were 0, 1.1, 2.3, 4.5, and 9 ppm (0, 7, 14.7, 28.8, and 57.6 mg/cu m) for 2-chloronitrobenzene ... . In 2-wk studies with 2-chloronitrobenzene, all rats survived to the end of the study. One of five male mice exposed to 18 ppm died, but weight gains of exposed rats and mice were not affected. Exposed rats and mice had concentration-related increases in liver weights, and spleen weights were increased in rats and mice exposed to 18 ppm. Histopathologic findings in rats were limited to hemosiderin deposition in the liver and spleen at the highest exposure concentration. Exposed mice, primarily those in the 18 ppm groups, had coagulative necrosis, hepatocytomegaly, and granulomatous inflammation in the liver. Splenic changes including increased hematopoietic cell proliferation and hemosiderin deposition occurred at concentrations as low as 4.5 ppm. In 13-wk studies with 2-chloronitrobenzene, all rats survived to the end of the study; 2 of 10 male mice exposed to 18 ppm died. Body weight gains of exposed rats and mice were similar to or somewhat higher than those of the respective controls. Methemoglobinemia occurred in rats and resulted in a normocytic, normochromic anemia that became responsive by the end of the study. Exposed rats and mice had increased liver weights but these increases were not as great as those seen in the 2-wk studies. Spleen weights were increased in exposed rats. Histopathologic changes in rats included increased basophilia of centrilobular hepatocytes, pigmentation and regeneration of the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney, and hyperplasia of the nasal cavity respiratory epithelium. In mice, hepatocellular necrosis, cytomegaly, mineralization, and chronic inflammation occurred in the liver, primarily in mice in the 18 ppm group, and hematopoietic activity in the spleen was increased. ...In reproductive system assessments, there was evidence of decreased spermatogenesis in rats exposed to either 2- or 4-chloronitrobenzene. In mice, effects were limited to a decrease in sperm motility in males exposed to 2-chloronitrobenzene and an increase in estrous cycle length in females exposed to 4-chloronitrobenzene. In continuous breeding studies, a progressive decrease in fertility was noted in CD-1 Swiss mice receiving 4-chloronitrobenzene by oral gavage; fertility was not affected in mice administered 2-chloronitrobenzene by oral gavage. Percutaneous absorption of [14C]-2-chloronitrobenzene and [14C]-4-chloronitrobenzene was demonstrated in rats. For doses ranging from 0.65 to 65 mg/kg of either chemical, 33% to 40% of 2-chloronitrobenzene and 51% to 62% of 4-chloronitrobenzene were absorbed under nonocclusive conditions. Oral absorption was somewhat higher than dermal absorption for both chemicals, and metabolism was complicated, with over 20 unidentified metabolites isolated from urine of rats ...  In summary,  inhalation exposure of rats and mice to 2- or 4-chloronitrobenzene resulted in methemoglobin formation and oxidative damage to red blood cells, leading to a regenerative anemia and a recognized spectrum of tissue damage and changes secondary to erythrocyte injury. In addition, numerous other lesions that were considered primary toxic effects occurred following exposure. These included renal hyaline droplet accumulation and testicular atrophy in male rats exposed to 4-chloronitroberizene and hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium in rats exposed to 2-chloronitrobenzene. A no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for rats was not achieved, as increases in methemoglobin and histopathologic changes occurred at exposure concentrations as low as 1.1 ppm for 2-chloronitrobenzene and 1.5 ppm for 4-chloronitrobenzene in the 13-week studies. The NOAEL for histopathologic injury in mice was 4.5 ppm for 2-chloronitrobenzene and 6 ppm for 4-chloronitrobenzene.",

The 33 day-NOEC was determined ... to be 0.264 mg/L based on the endpoint 'normal larvae' related to the hatched larvae. The review of the raw data of the study shows that at the next higher test concentration of 0.530 mg/L a statistically significant effect compared to the control could be observed, however, there is no dose-effect relation for this endpoint at higher test concentrations. The highest test concentration of 3.9 mg/L shows less normal larvae after hatch with a deviation of 7% compared to the control. Apart from that regarding the endpoint 'normal larvae related to initial embryos' no effect at any concentration can be seen. Regarding 'weight' and 'length' of the fry, at both endpoints a deviation to the control of >5% can be seen at a concentration of 2.04 mg/L.

Parent animals in the test and control vessels had to be pipetted 3 times/week in freshly prepared test and control media at the corresponding concentration level.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.018 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 94 days. Weak absorption of UV light greater than 290 nm by 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene indicates potential for photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene is expected to have moderate mobility in soil based on an estimated Koc value of 316. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces may occur given a Henry's Law constant of 9.3X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Chloro-2-nitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Screening tests using river water and activated sludge, suggest biodegradation of 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 80 hours and 40 days, respectively. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. BCF values of 7.0-22.3 measured in fish, suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.3X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 80 hours and 40 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), BCF values of 7.0-22.3 measured in fish(6), suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Screening tests using river water(7) and activated sludge(6), suggest biodegradation of 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene proceeds slowly in water. Weak absorption of UV light greater than 290 nm in methanol indicates potential for photolysis of 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene in sunlit surface water(8).",

The 2nd order, carbon normalized rate constants for solutions containing 80 uM 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene were recorded as 5.2X10-5 L/hr-mg C at pH 5.5, 1.6X10-4 L/hr-mg C at pH 7.2 and 3.6X10-4 L/hr-mg C at pH 8.6(1). The results from this study demonstrate that natural organic matter mediates the reduction of substituted nitroaromatic compounds in reducing environments. It is suggested that quinone-type species play a predominant role in natural organic matter mediated reductions of chloronitrobenzene(1). Quinoid-type compounds and iron porphyrins were shown to be effective mediators for the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds, including chloronitrobenzenes(2). Reaction conditions are homogeneous aqueous solutions (pH 6.8-7.0, 5 mM H2S) containing reduced sulfur species as bulk electron donors(2). Therefore, the reduction of chloronitrobenzenes in the environment may occur under reducing conditions in the presence of electron transfer mediators(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

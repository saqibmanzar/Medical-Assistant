Vorinostat, a second generation polar-planar compound, binds to the catalytic domain of the histone deacetylases (HDACs). This allows the hydroxamic moiety to chelate zinc ion located in the catalytic pockets of HDAC, thereby inhibiting deacetylation and leading to an accumulation of both hyperacetylated histones and transcription factors. Hyperacetylation of histone proteins results in the upregulation of the cyclin-dependant kinase p21, followed by G1 arrest. Hyperacetylation of non-histone proteins such as tumor suppressor p53, alpha tubulin, and heat-shock protein 90 produces additional anti-proliferative effects. This agent also induces apoptosis and sensitizes tumor cells to cell death processes. Vorinostat crosses the blood-brain barrier.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Recently, it has been suggested that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) may reduce apoptotic cell death in various model systems. However, their utility in interfering with DA cell death remains unclear. The HDACIs sodium butyrate (NaB), valproate (VPA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) were tested for their ability to prevent MPP(+)-mediated cytotoxicity in human derived SK-N-SH and rat derived MES 23.5 cells. All three HDACIs at least partially prevented MPP(+)-mediated apoptotic cell death. The protective effects of these HDACIs coincided with significant increases in histone acetylation. These results suggest that HDACIs may be potentially neuroprotective against DA cell death ...",

HDACi induce acetylation of histones and nonhistone proteins, which affect gene expression, cell cycle progression, cell migration, and cell death. The mechanism of the tumor selective action of HDACi is unclear. Here, /the authors/ show that the HDACi, vorinostat (Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA), induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in normal (HFS) and cancer (LNCaP, A549) cells. Normal cells in contrast to cancer cells repair the DSBs despite continued culture with vorinostat. In transformed cells, phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX), a marker of DNA DSBs, levels increased with continued culture with vorinostat, whereas in normal cells, this marker decreased with time. Vorinostat induced the accumulation of acetylated histones within 30 min, which could alter chromatin structure-exposing DNA to damage. After a 24-hr culture of cells with vorinostat, and reculture without the HDACi, gammaH2AX was undetectable by 2 hr in normal cells, while persisting in transformed cells for the duration of culture. Further, /investigators/ found that vorinostat suppressed DNA DSB repair proteins, e.g., RAD50, MRE11, in cancer but not normal cells. Thus, the HDACi, vorinostat, induces DNA damage which normal but not cancer cells can repair. This DNA damage is associated with cancer cell death. These findings can explain, in part, the selectivity of vorinostat in causing cancer cell death at concentrations that cause little or no normal cell death.",

However, another inhibitor, valproic acid, could not improve cloning efficiency. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, oxamflatin, trichostatin A, and scriptaid are inhibitors for classes I and IIa/b histone deacetylase, whereas valproic acid is an inhibitor for classes I and IIa, suggesting that inhibiting class IIb histone deacetylase is an important step for reprogramming mouse cloning efficiency.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

The present study was designed to determine whether the inhibitory effects of SAHA occur during the initiation process or at subsequent stages in the carcinogenic process. In addition, animals with established NMU tumors were administered SAHA to determine whether SAHA could inhibit the continued growth of established mammary tumors. It was found that SAHA fed at 900 ppm in the diet inhibited tumor yields when administered from 14 days prior to NMU administration to termination (-14 to +130) and from +14 and +28 days to termination. However, SAHA had no effect on tumor yields when administered from -14 to +14 or from -14 to +50 days and then returned to the control diets for the remainder of the experimental period (130 days). These results indicate that the inhibitory effects of SAHA are not exerted at the initiation phase of NMU-induced mammary tumorigenesis and appear, instead, to inhibit the subsequent stages in tumor development. Of most interest was the ability of SAHA to inhibit the growth of established mammary tumors. Administration of SAHA in the diet at 900 ppm resulted in significant inhibition of established tumor growth. Thirty-two percent of SAHA-treated tumors exhibited partial regression compared to 12% of controls, growth was stabilized in 24% of treated tumors compared to 12% of controls while 11% exhibited complete regression compared to 0% of controls. Collectively, SAHA-treated tumors exhibited a 7-fold reduction in growth compared to untreated tumors over the test period. ...",

Baculosomes expressing human UGTs and 52 human liver microsomes were screened for vorinostat glucuronidation activity to identify the potential enzymes and functional variants. UGT2B17 had the largest activity. Human liver microsomes with at least one copy of UGT2B17 showed significantly greater enzymatic activity than those with UGT2B17 null genotype (P<0.004). UGT2B17 plays an important role in vorinostat hepatic glucuronidation and the gene deletion polymorphism may influence vorinostat biotransformation and clearance. The clinical impact of this UGT2B17 genetic variant on vorinostat metabolism and drug effect is unknown.",

In this study, the effect of co-treatment with MMC and SAHA to induce apoptosis in cultured conjunctival epithelial cells (CEs) in rabbit was investigated. The cytotoxic potential following co-treatment with MMC and SAHA in CEs via assay for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was also examined. Co-treatment with MMC and SAHA did not induce apoptosis in CEs. In addition, co-treatment with MMC and SAHA caused no significant alteration of ROS and LDH levels in CEs. This study therefore shows that low-dose MMC could still be used as an antimetabolite in co-treatment with SAHA to effectively inhibit fibrosis of Tenon's capsule fibroblasts (TCFs) following glaucoma filtration surgery, while minimizing cytotoxicity in CEs.",

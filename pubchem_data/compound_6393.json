When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: It can cause confusion, headache by inhalation. ANIMAL STUDIES: Tetrafluoromethane caused increases in acetylcholine output from the guinea-pig ileum. The anesthetic potencies of binary mixtures of the gases CF4-Ar and CF4-SF6 were studied in mice.",

The mixtures SF6-N2O and N2O-Ar showed additive behavior, whereas the constituents of the mixture SF6-Ar were non-additive, having a smaller total potency than expected. Further experiments on this mixture with Italian Great Newts and on the carbon tetrafluoride mixtures CF4-Ar and CF4-SF6 with mice suggested that the anomalous potencies may arise from specific pulmonary effects associated with the breathing of SF6 accompanied by a high pressure of some other gas.",

The toxicity of this series of halocarbons was assessed in light of a molecular model for the carcinogenic effects of carbon-tetrachloride which suggests that cellular damage results from free radicals produced following the transfer of an electron from an enzyme to the carbon-tetrachloride molecule. The carcinogenic activity of the halocarbon series was studied by calculating the vertical electron affinities (VEA) of the various molecules using quantum chemical calculations or physical measurements. Based on experimentally determined and calculated VEA values, CF4 was considered nontoxic on the basis of the free radical model, CF3Cl was considered equivocal, CF3Br was considered toxic, and CF3I was considered to be carcinogenic. In many cases, the toxicity of the halocarbons increased with their efficacy as combustion inhibitors.",

Its formation from production of aluminum can result in its direct release to the environment. No natural sources of tetrafluoromethane have been identified, however data are conflicting. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.75X10+5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tetrafluoromethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Tetrafluoromethane has an atmospheric lifetime of 2300 to 50,000 years. Tetrafluoromethane has reported 100- and 500-Year Global Warming Potentials of 6500 and 8800, respectively. Tetrafluoromethane is exceedingly inert photochemically, with no absorption at wavelengths longer than 110 nm; therefore, it is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tetrafluoromethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 44. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.15 atm-cu m/mole. Tetrafluoromethane will volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process as highly chlorinated/fluorinated compounds are not expected to biodegrade. If released into water, tetrafluoromethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to tetrafluoromethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tetrafluoromethane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to tetrafluoromethane via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively(SRC). Tetrafluoromethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.18(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ever increasing concentrations are attributed mainly to aluminum manufacturing (33 parts/trillion volume) and electronic chip production(1). The worldwide primary aluminum producers have reduced polyfluorinated carbon emissions per unit aluminum production by 47% from 1990 through 1997(2). Firn air (air present inside snow) samples collected at the North Greenland ice core project site in Greenland and from Berkner Island, Antarctica indicate that tetrafluoromethane increased from 40 to 78 parts/trillion between 1959 and 2003(3).",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

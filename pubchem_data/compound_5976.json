For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In addition to the contact irritant effects, the acute effects of dimethylhydrazine exposure may involve the central nervous system as exemplified by tremors and convulsions and behavioral changes at sublethal doses. /It was/... noted that the deaths probably involve respiratory arrest and cardiovascular collapse. The central nervous system as a target is consistent with the delayed latency in response reported for dimethylhydrazine. There is some evidence that 1,1-dimethylhydrazine may act as an inhibitor of glutamic acid decarboxylase, thereby adversely affecting the aminobutyric acid shunt, and could explain the latency of CNS effects. Furthermore, vitamin B6 analogues that act as coenzymes in the aminobutyric acid shunt have been shown to be effective antagonists to 1,1-dimethylhydrazine toxicity.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

For each 1 g of dimethylhydrazine, place 32 ml (approximately 25% excess) of commercial laundry bleach (containing approximately 5% sodium hypochlorite) into a 3-necked round-bottom flask equipped with a stirrer, thermometer and dropping funnel. Add the aqueous dimethylhydrazine dropwise to the stirred hypochlorite solution, monitoring the rate of addition by rise in temperature.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Runoff to sewer may create fire or explosion hazard. Containers may explode when heated. Many liquids are lighter than water. /1,1-Dimethylhydrazine; Dimethylhydrazine, unsymmetrical/",

After 20 weeks of dimethylhydrazine treatment, the number of plaque forming cells per spleen, following intravenous inoculation with 5 cells, was nearly three times greater in the whey protein-fed group than in the casein-fed mice although both values were substantially below normal. After 24 weeks of dimethylhydrazine treatment the incidence of tumors in the whey protein-fed mice was substantially lower than that in mice fed either the casein or Purina diet. Similarly, the tumor area was less in the whey protein group in comparison to either the casein or Purina groups, with some difference between casein and Purina groups. Body weight curves were similar in all dietary groups. In conclusion, a whey protein diet appears to significantly inhibit the incidence and growth of chemically induced colon tumors in mice."

A 24 factorial experimental design was used to examine the main and interactive effects of 15% wheat bran (WB), 1% cholesterol (CH) with cholic acid, 20% beef tallow (BT), and 0.1% indole-3-carbinol (IC) on 160 male F344 rats treated ip with DMH (10 mg/kg) weekly for 16 weeks. The test diets were fed for 3 weeks before, 16 weeks during, and 12 weeks after DMH administration. At necropsy, total weight gain, liver and spleen weights, serum cholestrol levels, liver aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, and the size, number, incidence, and location of intestinal tumors were analyzed for dietary factor effects. The most significant inducer to tumors was the combination of cholesterol+beef tallow+indole-3-carbinol acting in synergism. The single main effect most responsible for tumor morbidity was indole-3-carbinol, which appeared to enhance tumorigenesis via its role as an inducer of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity. The wheat bran decreased tumor incidence and burden when added to diets also containing cholesterol, but it otherwise increased tumor burden per tumor-bearing animal and incidence in all other diets. This study demonstrated the need for examining synergistic and antagonist interactions among dietary initiators and/or promoters of colon carcinogenesis, as well as implicating indole-3-carbinol as a significant factor in the development of DMH-induced tumors in rats.",

The order of copper(II)-mediated DNA damage (1,2-dimethylhydrazine greater than monomethylhydrazine approximately l,l-dimethylhydrazine) was not correlated with the order of methyl free radical (.CH3) generation during copper(II)-catalyzed autoxidation (monomethylhydrazine greater than l,l-dimethylhydrazine much greater than 1,2-dimethylhydrazine). Catalase and bathocuproine, a Cu(I)-specific chelating agent, inhibited DNA damage while catalase did not inhibit the methyl free radical generation. The order of DNA damage was correlated with the order of ratio of H202 production to 02 consumption observed during copper(II)-catalyzed autoxidation of methylhydrazines. These results suggest that the copper(I)-peroxide complex rather than the methyl free radical plays a more important role in methylhydrazine plus copper(II)-induced DNA damage.",

The effect was independent of the time the iron-diet was fed, ie, during dimethylhydrazine-treatment or following the dimethylhydrazine-treatment period. The increase of tumor rate depended on the iron concentration in the diet (0.5-3.5%). The concentration-dependent iron accumulation in the colonic mucosa of mice was paralleled by increments of malonaldehyde contents indicating lipid peroxidation, another factor known to be involved in tumor development. It is suggested that iron exerts cocarcinogenic activity in the dimethylhydrazine-model by stimulating cell proliferation and inducing oxidative stress in the colonic mucosa. This effect of iron is independent of the time of tumor-initiation by dimethylhydrazine, as it is also observed in the period of tumor-promotion/progression after dimethylhydrazine-treatment.",

If released to the atmosphere, 1,1-dimethylhydrazine will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on a measured vapor pressure of 167 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine is expected to react very quickly with ozone in the troposphere with an estimated half-life of 16.5 minutes. Vapor-phase 1,1-dimethylhydrazine is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 6 days. If released to soil, 1,1-dimethylhydrazine is expected to have very high mobility based on an estimated Koc of 20. 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine is a weak base with pKa of 7.21, suggesting that it will partially exist in the protonated form in water and moist soils and the protonated form may adsorb to soils more than the free base. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected for the protonated species since cations do not volatilize. Volatilization may occur for the neutral species based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilization of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine from dry soil surfaces may exist based on its vapor pressure. 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine degrades in soils through a combination of biotic and abiotic processes; however, at high concentrations 1,1-dimethylhydrazine is toxic to microbial organisms. 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine was degraded 0, 11, 11, and 50% in cleaned sand (100% sand), sandy soil, organic soil, and clay soil, respectively in a 1 hour soil column study. If released to water, the neutral species is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based on the estimated Koc value; however, the protonated form may have greater adsorption. The protonated form will not volatilize, but the neutral species may volatilize based on the estimated Henry's Law constant. Volatilization half-lives of 36 hours and 19 days were estimated for a model pond and lake, respectively for the free base. The half-life of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine in pond water ranged from 16 to 22 days and the half-life in sea water was about 13 days. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 1,1-dimethylhydrazine occurs through inhalation and dermal contact at workplaces where this compound is produced and used. Monitoring data suggest the general population may be exposed to 1,1-dimethylhydrazine through the inhalation of tobacco smoke or ingestion of food items containing this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization of the protonated species from moist soils will not occur since cations do not volatilize. Volatilization of the free base may occur, based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its vapor pressure, 167 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 1X10+6 mg/L(5). Volatilization from dry soils may occur based on the vapor pressure of this compound(4). 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine degrades in soils through a combination of biotic and abiotic processes. 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine was degraded 0, 11, 11, and 50% in cleaned sand (100% sand), Vandenburg Air Force Base soil (99.1% sand, 0.4% clay, pH 6.1), organic soil (96% sand, 1% clay, 1% carbon, pH 6.4), and clay (69.3% sand, 27.95% clay, pH 3.7), respectively(3).",

Volatilization of the protonated species will not occur since cations do not volatilize. Volatilization of the free base may occur(4), based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its vapor pressure, 167 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 1X10+6 mg/L(6). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 36 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 19 days(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -1.19(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). The estimated half lives of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, initially present in pond water at 6.5 and 13.1 mM, are 16.3 and 22.2 days, respectively, and in sea water at the same concentrations are both 12.6 days(3).",

Vapor-phase 1,1-dimethylhydrazine is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC).  The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated as 2.5X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) using a structure estimation method(4). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm. 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine is not expected to undergo direct photolysis since it does not absorb UV light in the environmentally significant range (> 290 nm)(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine also reacts very rapidly with ozone in the ambient atmosphere(2). Reaction of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine with ozone occurred too rapidly to measure the rate constant experimentally(2,3). The rate constant of the reaction was estimated to be greater than 1X10-15 cu cm/molecule sec(2,3). Assuming an ozone concentration of 7X10+11 molecules/cu cm, this minimum rate constant translates into a half-life of about 16.5 minutes(SRC). 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine does not contain hydrolyzable functional groups, but may react with oxidants in water such as singlet oxygen, peroxy radicals, or trace metals found in natural waters or soils that catalyze the decomposition of hydrazines(4). The estimated half lives of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, initially present in pond water at 6.5 and 13.1 mM, are 16.3 and 22.2 days, respectively, and in sea water at the same concentrations are both 12.6 days(4). Aqueous oxidation of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine occurred with half-lives of 3.9-630 hr at pH values of 9-5(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.0 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.3 days. If released to soil, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine is expected to have moderate mobility based upon a Koc of 250. The pKa of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine is 7.4, indicating that this compound will mainly exist in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts, thus attenuating soil mobility. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine, present at 1 mM, degraded 100% in >97 days at pH 7 using a screening test. Under aerobic conditions, 100% transformation of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine occurred in 2 weeks in soils previously contaminated with pyridine contaminants. If released into water, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine is expected to adsorb slightly to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc although the cation may be strongly adsorbed. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.1 and 38 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces may be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 6 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine may occur by dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine is produced or used. (SRC)",

The pKa of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine is 7.4(4), indicating that this compound will mainly exist in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts, thus attenuating soil mobility(5). Volatilization of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.0 mm Hg(6), and water solubility, 3.5X10+4 mg/l(7). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 2.0 mm Hg(6). Under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine, present at 1 mM, degraded 100% in >97 days at pH 7 using a 0.5% garden soil suspension with glucose-yeast extract (20 ppm) and a screening test(8). Within 2 weeks under aerobic conditions, 100% transformation of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine occurred in soil previously contaminated with pyridine contaminants(9).",

However, the pKa of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine is 7.4(4), indicating that this compound will mainly exist in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.0 mm Hg(6), and water solubility, 3.5x10+4 mg/l(7). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.1 and 38 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(8), an estimated BCF of 6(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine, present at 1 mM, degraded 100% in >97 days at pH 7 using a 0.5% garden soil suspension with glucose-yeast extract (20 ppm) and a screening test(10).",

An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2.3 hrs at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 2,4,6-Trimethylpyridine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(2). 3,5-Lutidine, a structurally similar alkylated pyridine, has a weak absorption band that extends into the environmental UV spectrum(3), which suggests that direct photolysis is not likely to be an important fate process for alkylated pyridines(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

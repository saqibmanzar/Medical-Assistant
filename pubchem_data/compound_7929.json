Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Approximately 60% of inspired xylene is retained and approximately 90% of ingested xylene is absorbed. Absorption also occurs by the dermal route, but to a much lesser extent than by the inhalation and oral routes. Following absorption, xylene is rapidly distributed throughout the body by way of the systemic circulation. In the blood, it is primarily bound to serum proteins and accumulates primarily in adipose tissue. Xylene is primarily metabolized by oxidation of a methyl group and conjugation with glycine to yield the methylhippuric acid, whicih is the primary metabolite excreted in urine. Aromatic hydroxylation of xylene to xylenol occurs to only a limited extent in humans. Less than 2% of an absorbed dose is excreted in the urine as xylenol. Other minor metabolites found in urine include methylbenzyl alcohol and glucuronic acid conjugates of the oxidized xylene. In humans, hepatic microsomal CYP2E1 is the primary enzyme involved with the metabolism of xylene to methylbenzylalcohol, the dominant pathway leading to the formation of methylhippuric acid isomers. Unmetabolized xylene can be exhalated or also excreted in urine. (L165) ",

MX is the most basic xylene and its complex with HF-BF3 is the most stable. The relative basicities of MX, OX /2-xylene/, PX /4-xylene/, and EB /ethylbenzene/ are 100, 2, 1, and 0.14, respectively. MX of >99% purity can be obtained with the MGCC process with <1% MX left in the raffinate by phase separation of hydrocarbon layer from the complex-HF layer. The latter undergoes thermal decomposition, which liberates the components of the complex.",

Ten new vehicles were examined in order to check interior emission from materials used to equip the passenger compartment. In order to compare and define the impact of exhaust gases, air samples were also collected from two used cars, at different mileages (up to 20,000 km). All vehicles tested were of the same type. Samples were collected onto Carbograph 1TD sorbent, thermally desorbed and examined with the use of gas chromatography with flame ionization and mass spectrometry detectors. All results obtained were referred to Polish and German requirements for indoor air quality (both in public buildings and in workspace environments). Average benzene, toluene, o-xylene and m, p-xylene concentrations in new cars were determined at the level of 11.8 microg/cu m, 82.7 micro/cu m, 21.2 microg/cu m and 89.5 micro/cu m, respectively. In the used cars, BTX concentration increased with increasing vehicle mileage. The most significant increase of BTX concentration was observed above 11,000 km mileage.",

Simultaneous determination of toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes and styrene has been carried out and the method has been optimized for both instrumental parameters and samples treatment. Chromatographic conditions have been set in order to obtain a good separation of xylene isomers due to the interest in p-xylene as ototoxic one. Method validation has been performed on standards spiked in blank saliva by using two internal standards (2-fluorotoluene and deuterated styrene-d(8)). This method showed the possibility to detect the target compounds with a linear dynamic range of at least a 2 orders of magnitude characterized by a linear determination coefficient (r(2)) greater than 0.999. The limit of detection (LOD) ranged between 0.19 ng/mL (styrene) and 0.54 ng/mL (m-xylene) and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) ranged between 0.64 ng/mL (styrene) and 1.8 ng/mL (m-xylene). The method achieved good accuracy (from 99 to 105%) and precision for both intra- and inter-assay (relative standard deviation ranging from 1.7 to 13.8%) for all six compounds concerned. The repeatability was improved by adding sodium sulphate to the matrix. Saliva samples resulted stable for at least 7 days after collection, if stored in headspace vials, at the temperature of 4 degrees C. An evaluation of the main sources of uncertainty of the method is also included: expanded uncertainties ranges between 10 and 16% for all of the target compounds. In summary, the headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method is a highly sensitive, versatile and flexible technique for the biological monitoring of exposure to ototoxic solvents by saliva analysis.",

The extraction procedure was performed on acidified urines, after addition of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid as internal standard, using a butylchloride/isopropanol mixture and drying 0.5 ml of the organic layer under nitrogen flow. The residue obtained was dissolved in 0.1 ml water/acetonitrile and 5 microliters were injected into an HPLC apparatus equipped with a 0.26 X 25 cm HC ODS SIL X column. Absorbance measures were performed at 225 nm throughout the investigation. All metabolites were clearly separated in a short time (12 min) and the amounts of other urinary compounds affecting the analysis were so small that the measurement of low concentrations of the urinary metabolites could be easily performed. Linear calibration curves were obtained from 0.1 to 3 mg/mL and a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99 was found between concentrations of the standards and areas of the peaks. Statistical analysis confirms that this method, which has a high reproducibility, is simple, reliable, and useful for the biologic monitoring of industrial exposure to aromatic compounds.",

Exposure to this clear, colorless sweet-smelling liquid may occur from its use as a chemical intermediate, as a component of gasoline, and as an industrial solvent. Toxic by all routes of exposure (ie, dermal, ingestion, and inhalation), 3-xylene can cause effects including headache, dizziness, skin and eye irritation, kidney and liver damage, pulmonary edema, coma, and death. The ACGIH recommends a workplace exposure limit (TLV) of 100 ppm as an 8-hr time-weighted average (TWA); however, to assure protection, wear an approved canister or air-supplied mask, face shield, plastic gloves, and boots and use non-sparking tools when handling 3-xylene. In emergency situations, a self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing are recommended. If contact does occur, immediately flush exposed eyes with running water, wash exposed skin with soap and water, and remove contaminated clothing. Individuals with diseases of the central nervous system, liver, kidneys, and blood should be protected from exposure. 3-Xylene is easily ignitable by heat, sparks, or flame (flash point: 25 \u00b0C, closed cup) and may do so explosively in an enclosed area. Also, vapor may travel a considerable distance to a source of ignition and flash back. The heat of a fire may cause containers to explode and/or cause thermal degradation of 3-xylene, producing acrid smoke and toxic gases. Fires involving 3-xylene may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or foam. For massive fires in enclosed areas, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. If a 3-xylene tank car or truck is involved in a fire, isolate 1/2 mile in all directions. Runoff from fire control water may cause pollution, and, upon entering a sewer, may create an explosion hazard. Storage of 3-xylene is preferably in outdoor or detached areas, away from heat, any sources of ignition, oxidizing agents, and any activity that could cause physical damage to containers. For small spills of 3-xylene, take up with sand or other non-combustible absorbent and place in containers for later disposal, or absorb on paper and evaporate in an appropriate exhaust hood. In either case, take care to avoid contact with the liquid or vapor. For large spills, isolate the area, dike far ahead of the spill and collect the material for disposal. 3-Xylene is a good candidate for the Belliot process of oxidative destruction, as well as liquid injection, rotary kiln, and fluidized bed incineration. 3-Xylene may be sent to a solvent disposal company, but prior to implementing any land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult regulatory agencies for guidance.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

It is used as a solvent; intermediate for dyes and organic synthesis, especially isophthallic acid; in insecticides; in aviation fuel. m-Xylene is also used in the manufacturing of polyester and alkyl resins. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: The effects of exposure to m-xylene on the central nervous system were investigated in humans. Male volunteers were exposed to m-xylene vapor, at stable concentration of 8.2 umol/L or fluctuating concentration with peaks (16.4 umol/L) for 4 hr a day. Body balance of subjects was clearly impaired in the anteroposterior direction, especially when subjects closed their eyes during the peaks at rest. Body balance improved when subjects exercised, even in the presence of the high m-xylene concn in the blood. Complex motor reactions were impaired after the peaks combined with exercise. In other experiment volunteers exposed to m-xylene were subjected to tests of numerical ability, reaction time, short-term memory and critical flicker fusion. There was evidence of reduction in the performance on 3 of the 4 tests in the second set of experiments. Slight, but statistically significant, increases in the average rating for subjective symptoms of neurological effects were observed following exposure to 50 ppm m-xylene vapor compared to controls. After 60 and 118 minutes of exposure, severity ratings for feelings of intoxication were elevated in men and women, and ratings for headache were elevated in men. The ratings for dizziness were increased in exposed men after 118 minutes of exposure. For biomonitoring purposes the m-and p-xylene isomers usually are measured together and reported as m/p-xylene. ANIMAL STUDIES: Exposure of rats to 2000 ppm of m-xylene for 3 days increased hepatic cytochrome P450 concentration and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cytochrome c reductase activity. Adverse respiratory effects noted in rats, mice, and guinea pigs following acute and intermediate inhalation exposure to m-xylene are similar to those observed in humans. They include decreased respiration, labored breathing, irritation of the respiratory tract, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pulmonary inflammation. In a study of levels of noradrenaline and dopamine in various parts of the forebrain and hypothalamus, rats (six males/group) were exposed to 0 or 2000 ppm m-xylene, 6 hr/day for 3 days. The animals were killed within 18 hr after the last exposure. A significant increase in catecholamine levels and turnover was observed in various parts of the hypothalamus of exposed animals. There was no effect on dopamine levels. Histological damage to the outer hair cells of the organ of Corti provided evidence of ototoxicity in rats exposed by oral gavage to p-xylene, but not m- or o-xylene, at a dose of 900 mg/kg/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks. No effect on absolute or relative heart weights was observed in male rats intermittently exposed to m-xylene at concentrations as high as 100 ppm for 13 weeks. Exposure of rats to 1 mg/L of m-xylene, 4 hr/day for 6 months caused inhibition of the phagocytic activity of leukocytes. Mice were exposed to m-xylene at 150, 1500, or 3000 mg/cu m, 24 hr/day from days 7-14 of gestation. Toxic effects were decreased weight of fetuses, decreased activity of succinic dehydrogenase, alkaline and acid phosphatase, and glucose 6-phosphatase. Also m-xylene changed characteristic features of functional maturity of the nephron, retardation of fetus was dose related. At highest dose level it increased preimplantation fetal losses, increased incidence of extra ribs and interfered with process of implantation. The o- and p- isomers appeared more hazardous to the offspring than did the m-isomer. Malformations (ie cleft palate) associated with mixed or individual isomers were primarily reported at maternally toxic doses. Each xylene isomer was administered to male rats intraperitoneally in 2 similar doses, 24 hours apart over a range of concentrations from 0, 0.12-0.75 mL/kg (105-650 mg/kg) and evaluated femoral bone marrow 30 hours after the first injection. No increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed for any xylene isomer. In an Ames assay, m-xylene did not revert Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, & TA100, either with or without metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: The xylene isomers have a similar degree of toxicity as mixed xylenes to estuarine/marine invertebrates. For m-xylene and p-xylene, the respective 48-hour LC50 values are 19.3 and 24.5 mg/L in brine shrimp, suggesting that the m-xylene and p-xylene isomers are slightly toxic to estuarine/marine invertebrates on an acute basis.",

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

Male Wistar-rats were exposed one for 6 hr to 300 ppm m-xylene or 600 ppm methyl ethyl ketone vapor alone or in combination. Other rats were exposed to 600 ppm methyl ethyl ketone and 300 ppm m-xylene, separately or together, daily for 7 days. They were then given a final exposure 18 hr later. The rats were killed 0.5 or 18 hr after the last exposure and the blood and perirenal fat /were taken and analyzed for xylene and MEK. The livers were/ removed and assayed for 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase, 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, and 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase. Urine samples collected from other animals were analyzed for methyl-hippuric acid, 2,4-dimethylphenol, and thioethers. Blood m-xylene concentrations were slightly, significantly increased in rats exposed to the mixture compared to those exposed to xylene only. Blood methyl ethyl ketone concentrations were not significantly affected by xylene. Blood xylene concentrations were similar in rats given the single and multiple exposures. Perirenal fat m-xylene concn in rats exposed to the mixture were significantly higher than in those exposed to xylene alone 0.5 and 18 hr after exposure ended. Xylene concentrations were significantly lower after the multiple exposure than after the single exposure. Fat methyl ethyl ketone concentrations were also increased by coexposure to m-xylene. Methyl-hippuric acid excretion was decreased and 2,4-dimethylphenol excretion increased in rats exposed to the mixture relative to those exposed to m-xylene only. All m-xylene exposed rats showed sharp increase in urinary thioether excretion. Thioether excretion in controls. Multiple exposures to xylene significantly increased hepatic 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase, 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, and 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity. Methyl ethyl ketone caused only a slight increase in activity of these enzymes. The combined exposures caused a synergistic increase in 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity and an additive increase in 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity. The authors conclude that methyl ethyl ketone inhibits the metabolism of xylene by suppressing side chain oxidation, but not oxidation of the aromatic ring.",

First, the metabolic constants (Vmax and Km) were determined for toluene and m-xylene individually by conducting a series of closed-chamber inhalation exposures of three rats to starting concn of 500 to 4000 ppm. The values of Km (toluene, 0.55 mg/L; m-xylene, 0.20 mg/L) and Vmax (toluene, 4.8 mg/hr/kg; m-xylene, 8.4 mg/hr/kg) were obtained following best visual fit of physiologically based toxicokinetic model simulations to experimental data. Then using the same experimental set-up, rats were exposed to three different mixtures of both solvents (500 ppm toluene + 1000 ppm m-xylene; 1000 ppm toluene + 1000 ppm m-xylene; 1000 ppm toluene + 500 ppm m-xylene). The data from the time course of chamber solvent concn were analyzed with a binary chemical mixture physiologically based toxicokinetic model that had four mechanistic hypotheses of metabolic interaction (i.e., no interaction, competitive inhibition, noncompetitive inhibition, and uncompetitive inhibition) quantitatively defined in the liver compartment. The validity of the various model descriptions was verified with open-chamber inhalation exposure data on toxicokinetics of toluene and m-xylene. Overall, the results of this combined experimental and modeling approach are consistent with a competitive metabolic inhibition between m-xylene and toluene in the rat.",

The TWA concentration was always the same (8.2 umol/L). The body balance of the subjects was clearly impaired in the anteroposterior (a-p) direction, especially with their eyes closed during the peaks at rest, whereas it was improved when exercise was included in spite of the higher blood m-xylene concentrations. When on the contrary, the situation was reversed in the lateral direction. Complex audiomotor reactions were impaired after the peaks combined with exercise, whereas changes in simple reaction times were similar in pattern to those found for body balance in the a-p direction. The results suggest a complex interaction between physiological factors and m-xylene and development of adaptation or tolerance during the exposure.",

The atmospheric m-xylene concentrations were either fixed at 8.2 umol/L (200 ppm) or they fluctuated (5.2-16.4 umol/L; 135-400 ppm) with peaks of 16.4 umol/L and duration of 10 minutes at the beginning of each exposure session. The subjects were sedentary or exercised at 100 W for 10 minutes at the time of the peaks. The two control days, with and without exercise, were similar to the exposure days but without exposure. Body sway was measured with the subjects' eyes open and closed before they entered the chamber and in the chamber immediately after the cessation of the peak exposure when blood samples for gas chromatographic analysis were also drawn. Changes in the eyes closed/open ratio of the average and maximal body sway along the sagittal and lateral axes were calculated using the morning value as a reference. Changes in the eyes closed/open ratios of both average and maximal body sway correlated positively with blood m-xylene concentrations during fixed (8.2 umol/L) exposure at rest and during fluctuating exposure combined with exercise as analyzed with linear regression analysis. The results suggest that m-xylene has a dose related effect on the sense of balance at moderate atmospheric levels.",

A tiered approach is pursued to gather the information on each chemical, with each subsequent tier, of the three tiers, including more complex toxicology and exposure studies. The sponsor develops a chemical assessment at each tier , including a data needs assessment. EPA reviews the sponsor's assessment and develops a response to the sponsor specifically on the data needs assessment. In the case of xylenes, EPA has determined that Tier 1 exposure assessment is complete and all Tier 1 toxicity studies have been conducted; there is no need for any Tier 2 exposure or toxicity studies at the time of EPA's assessment. However, EPA identified two data needs for TIer 3 toxicity studies; a developmental neurotoxicity study and an adult neurotoxicity screening battery, preferably using mixed xylenes and inhalation exposure.[U.S. EPA Risk Assessment Division, OPPTS; Voluntary Childrens Chemical Evaluation Program: Data Needs Assessment of Xylenes. 19 pp. (March 2007) Available from, as of October 15, 2008: http://www.epa.gov/oppt/vccep/pubs/chem12a.html]"

Terminal body weights were not statistically significantly (students t-test, p < 0.05) changed in the high or low dose groups. Total kidney weights in either the high or low dose group animals were not significantly (p > 0.05) different from controls. Gross necropsy observations in individual animals included: hemorrhage in heart; red foci and dark areas in lungs, small and reddened lungs; brown and speckled cortices in kidneys, pale areas in kidneys; gray capsular areas and pale areas in livers; red areas in thymus, small and mottled thymus; red cecum; dark foci in spleen; dark foci in stomach, contents black; red and tan foci in pancreas; calculus in bladder, urine black; and yellow mucoid contents in intestines. Histopathological findings in kidneys included hyaline droplet change (in 10 low, and 10 high dose rats) and regenerative epithelium (in 8 low, and 7 high dose rats), while no incidence of tubular dilatation with granular material was observed. These kidney findings were used to calculate an index of hydrocarbon nephrotoxicity. This was defined as the group average of the sum of scores for individuals which ranged from 0 to 4 in severity for each endpoint for the degree of hyaline droplet change, number of foci of regenerative epithelium, and the number of foci of tubular dilatation with granular material; values were 2.7 for the low dose group, 2.6 for the high dose group, and 3.0 for the saline treated control group. Additional histopathological findings in kidneys included mononuclear cell infiltrate (in 10 low, and 10 high dose rats), hyaline casts (in 1 low dose rat), and tubular mineralization (in 1 low dose rat).",

Cod eggs (Gadus morhus L.) /were exposed/ to xylene isomers in covered glass dishes and monitored the effects both during fertilization and during early cleavage of fertilized eggs.

Fertilized eggs were exposed to xylene for 3 or 6 hr before first cleavage. No significant difference was observed between the individual xylene isomers or between the two exposure periods. Effects on the early cleavage pattern were significant for xylene concentrations between 2 and 7 mg/L. The effects seen included inhibition of formation of the cleavage furrow. Small cells or a total absence of cleavage occurred on exposure to all isomers at concentrations of 16-35 mg/L, while incomplete or uneven cleavage was found at exposures of 8-15 mg/L.",

Vapor-phase 3-xylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours. 3-Xylene has been detected in rainwater and snow and, therefore, it may be removed from the air by wet deposition. 3-Xylene does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-xylene is expected to have moderate mobility based upon Koc values ranging from 166-275. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.18X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 3-Xylene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 3-Xylene biodegrades in soil and water under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Biodegradation is an important process in subsurface soils and groundwater where volatilization is hindered. Utilizing a standard test (manometric respirometry), 98% of the theoretical biodegradation was reached in 4 weeks indicating 3-xylene can be readily biodegradable. However, under anaerobic conditions, a long lag period may be required before degradation commences. If released into water, 3-xylene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the range of Koc values. Under anaerobic conditions, 3-xylene was biodegraded in aquifer studies within weeks to months. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.1 hours and 4.1 days, respectively. A BCF of 14.8 in goldfish suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Photooxidation may have some importance in surface waters exposed to sunlight. Occupational exposure to 3-xylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-xylene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 3-xylene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 3-xylene. Contact with xylene occurs from a variety of consumer products, including gasoline, paint, varnish, shellac, rust preventives, and cigarette smoke. (SRC)",

Volatilization of 3-xylene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 7.18X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(5). 3-Xylene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 8.29 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(6). 3-Xylene is expected to biodegrade in soil under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions(7). Biodegradation is an important process in subsurface soils and groundwater where volatilization is hindered(7). 3-Xylene has been observed to biodegade in standard biodegradability tests using various inocula(8). For example, using OECD Guideline 301F (Ready Biodegradability: Manometric Respirometry Test) with a mixture of sewage, soil and natural water inoculum, 3-xylene reached 98% of its O2 consumption in 28 days which classified 3-xylene as readily biodegradable(8). 3-Xylene, present in soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, was completely degraded aerobically within 5 days(9), suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC). In anaerobic aquifer studies, 3-xylene was degraded, usually within several weeks(10). However, under anaerobic conditions, a long lag period may be required before xylene degradation commences(11).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(5) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.18X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(5), volatilization half-lives  for a model river and model lake are 3.1 hours and 4.1 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), a BCF of 14.8 measured in goldfish(8) suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation is an important process in groundwater where volatilization is hindered(9). 3-Xylene has been observed to biodegade in standard biodegradability tests using various inocula(10). For example, using OECD Guideline 301F (Ready Biodegradability: Manometric Respirometry Test) with a mixture of sewage, soil and natural water inoculum, 3-xylene reached 98% of its O2 consumption in 28 days which classified 3-xylene as readily biodegradable(10). However, under anaerobic conditions, a long lag period may be required before xylene degradation commences(11). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(5). Irradiation studies using humic substances(12) suggest photooxidation may have some environmental importance in natural surface waters exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

Vapor-phase 3-xylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.31X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Vapor-phase 3-xylene is degraded slowly in the atmosphere by reaction with night-time nitrate radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 138 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.32X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4). 3-Xylene has been detected in rainwater and snow(5,6) and, therefore, it may be removed from the air by wet deposition(SRC). 3-Xylene does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Half-lives of >97 and 24 days were reported for the biodegradation of 3-xylene in Texas and Oklahoma aquifers, respectively(6). Up to 0.4 mM 3-xylene was rapidly mineralized to CO2 in a laboratory aquifer column operated under denitrifying conditions; the degradation rate constant under continuous flow conditions was >0.45/hr(7). Xylene (mixed isomers), present at 100 mg/L, reached 100% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test which classified xylene as readily biodegradable(8). Using OECD Guideline 301F (Ready Biodegradability: Manometric Respirometry Test) with a mixture of sewage, soil and natural water inoculum, 3-xylene reached 98% of its O2 consumption in 28 days which classified 3-xylene as readily biodegradable(9).",

The biotransformation of PS-6 gasoline in groundwater under initially aerobic (7-<21 days) followed by anaerobic conditions with no oxygenates added (initial 3-xylene = 800 ug/L) and with 15% methyl-tert-butyl ether (initial 3- xylene = 863 ug/L) resulted in zero-order rate constants of 63 and 44 ug/L/day (for the aerobic period of the experiment), respectively; biodegradation of 3-xylene in these soil microcosm studies was not complete within 420 days(2). Anaerobic aquifer microcosms from a methanogenic, leachate-impacted zone were spiked with 119-137.2 ug/L 3-xylene; under control, nitrate- and sulfate-amended conditions, losses of 7, 13, and 15%, respectively, were reported after 187 days incubation(3). In situ columns were packed with aquifer material from the anaerobic leachate-impacted North Bay, Ontario aquifer(3). In nitrate-amended and acetate-amended columns, 3-xylene was not degraded biotically, with a small amount of degradation due to abiotic mechanisms; however, in columns with added sulfate, 3-xylene was rapidly biodegraded within 10-50 days, depending on the site(3).",

Following the addition of nitrate, there was less complete removal of 3-/4-xylene however, the maximum removal rate was increased to 5.4 ug/L-hr(3). During biodegradation, methyl groups of 3-xylene were oxidized to carboxyls giving m-toluate followed by 2-hydroxy-5-oxohepta-2,4-dienoate(6). 3-Methylsalicylate was also reported as a metabolite from the biodegradation of 3-xylene(6). 3-Methylbenzyl fumaric acid and 3-methylbenzyl succinic acid(4) and 3-methylbenzoate and traces of 3-methylbenzaldehyde(7) were reported as metabolites from the biodegradation of 3-xylene under anaerobic conditions(4). Combined 3-/4-xylene was rapidly removed from aerobic strip-pit pond water (from coal mining) which had been amended with either nutrients or nutrients and sewage with less than 5% remaining after 12 days incubation; pond water alone required 43 days to reach 86% removal(5).",

Soil samples contaminated with jet fuel, containing 3-xylene at 0.067 ug/mL soil extract initially, contained 0 ug 3-xylene/ml soil extract after 5 days incubation(2). In non-acclimated aquifer material incubated with 10 mg/L radiolabeled 3-xylene under denitrifying conditions, approximately 20 and 78% of the solution radiolabel was distributed as nonvolatile products and CO2, respectively, by day 7(3). In acclimated aquifer material incubated with 5 mg/L radiolabeled 3-xylene under denitrifying conditions, approximately 3.4 and 94% of the solution radiolabel was distributed as nonvolatile products and CO2, respectively, by day 7(3). Biodegradation of 3-xylene did not occur in unamended aquifer material; however, the addition of nitrate allowed the degradation of 3-xylene within 25 days(4). Zero-order rate constants of >0.29 and 0.14 mg/L/day were reported in aquifer microcosms for 3-xylene in aerobic and nitrate-reducing conditions, respectively(5). Groundwater contaminated with combined 3-/4-xylene (at 1300 ug/L) was treated with both upflow aerated columns and rotating biological contactors with 98% removal in 37 days and 96% removal in 146 days, respectively(6). 98.1% of the combined 3- and 4-xylenes present initially were biodegraded in an activated sludge treatment plant(7).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 37 years at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). 3-Xylene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(5). 3-Xylene, at 30 mg/L in water, does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Negligible absorption above 290 nm has also been reported for 2-xylene(7).

In an ordinary Swedish environment and a high NOx environment, the ozone formation potential, relative to ethene, for 3-xylene are 47.4 and 88.4, respectively(1). 3-Xylene has a moderately high photochemical reactivity under smog conditions, higher than the other xylene isomers, with loss rates varying from 9-42% per hr(2,3,4,5). Under simulated atmospheric conditions, glyoxal, propanalone, and formaldehyde were formed as products from the degradation of 3-xylene(6). The photooxidation of 3-xylene results in the production of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-methylbenzyl nitrate, m-tolualdehyde, 4-nitro-3-xylene, 5-nitro-3-xylene, 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 6-nitro-2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, 4-nitro-2,6-dimethylphenol at 6.1, 2.9, 3.1, 20.6, 1.1, 18.1, 1.5, 0.6, 13.8, 0.2, 11.7, 0.2, and 7.6 as % reacted carbon, respectively(7). Irradiation of wood smoke resulted in the degradation of 3-and 4-xylene, combined, from initial concentrations of 14, 40, and 12 ppb to 7, 19, and 3 ppb, respectively, in three experiments(8).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Measured Koc values in soil have been reported to be 182(2), 166 and 275(3). According to a classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggest that 3-xylene is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. A Kp value (equilibrium-sorption coefficient) of 0.049 was measured for 3-xylene using a Borden soil column (98% sand, 0.29% organic carbon)(5). Benzene/toluene/xylene mixtures containing 3-xylene, were added to soil columns using aquifer material from the Cohansey aquifer (90% sand; 4.4% organic matter; pH-3.8); a partition coefficient of 8.74 was measured for 3-xylene(6). Adsorption coefficient values of 0.25, 0.23, and 0.02 were measured for 3-xylene, present in a benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene mixture, on montmorillonite, illite, and kaolinite (all with low to no organic carbon present), respectively, using a batch equilibrium technique(7). More 3-xylene vapor was sorbed by air-dry than oven-dry soil (Evesham clay; air-dry soil contained 37 g organic C, 350 g clay, and 60 g water/kg oven-dry soil) at relative vapor pressures of 3-xylene exceeding 0.6; this suggests that the planar 3-xylene molecule is either readily adsorbed by interlayer sites in the air-dry soil (more sites potentially available than in oven-dry soil) or, as it is a fairly soluble molecule, that some will dissolve in the water film in air-dry soil(8). 3-Xylene has been observed to pass through soil unchanged in concentration at a dune-infiltration site on the Rhine River(9). A soil leaching column study estimated a 3-xylene Koc of 282 using a chromatographic methodology(10).",

Of 186 supplies serving more than 10,000 persons, 1.1% were positive with the median and max values of 0.46 and 0.61 ppb respectively(1). The maximum combined amount of 3-/4-xylene in bank filtered Rhine River water in The Netherlands was 0.1 ppb(2). 0.1-0.8 ppb of 3-xylene was measured in 4 drinking water wells located near a landfill(3). 3-Xylene was detected in all 14 drinking water supplies studied, 10 surface and 4 ground, in the lowlands of Great Britain(4). 3-Xylene was identified in Cincinnati, OH drinking water in 1980 at 92 ng/L(5). Both raw and treated drinking water, source from North Sea water, contained 3-/4-xylene, combined, at <10-50 and 130-15,000 ng/L, respectively(6). Drinking water samples from Cincinnati, OH (in 1978 and 1980), Ottumwa, IA (in 1976), and Seattle, WA (in 1976) contained 3-xylene at unreported concentrations(7). Drinking water collected from 1206 domestic wells between 1985-2002 had positive 3-/4-xylene detections in 28 samples(8).",

Spent chlorination liquor from the bleaching of sulphite pulp contained 3-/4-xylene combined, at 0.9-5 g/ton pulp(2). Wastewater from 3 municipal treatment plants in Cincinnati, OH, contained xylenes, unspecified isomers, at concentrations ranging from 0.19 to 47 ug/L(3). Leachate from 6 of 6 hazardous waste landfills and 2 of 5 domestic landfills contained 3-/4-xylene combined, at concentrations of 10-4400 ug/L and 3.7-8.3 ug/L, respectively(4). Wastewater from the gasification of Indian Head lignite contains 3-/4-xylene combined, at an estimated concentration of 0.3 mg/L(5). Combined 3-/4-xylene was emitted by a four-stroke outboard motor into the water of a test stand basin at 71 mg/10 minutes(6). Combined 3-/4-xylene were measured in water-soluble fractions of Prudhoe Bay oil, Cook Inlet oil, fuel oil, and tanker ballast treatment effluent at 0.58, 0.78, 0.17, and 0.68 ppm, respectively(7). The concentration of 3-/4-xylene, combined, in a dissolved air flotation effluent from a class B refinery was 187 ng/g(8). Effluent from advanced waste treatment plants in Lake Tahoe, CA (in 1974), Pomona, CA (in 1974), and in Dallas, TX (in 1974) contained 3-xylene at unreported concentrations(9). 3-Xylene was detected in the odor emissions from a biological treatment plant for municipal solid waste in China(10). 3-/4-Xylene was detected in the volatiles emitted from corn, alfalfa and cereal silage at concentrations of 0.54-1.48 ng/L(11).",

Tunnel air from the Craeybeckx highway tunnel in Antwerp, Belgium contained 3-/4-xylene combined at 34 ug/cu m (background = 2.4 ug/cu m(2). Concentrations of 3-/4-xylene combined, in roadway studies were measured as 3.79, 4.43, 4.33% wt for roadway tests in the Lincoln Tunnel, NY, a Raleigh, NC roadway, and an Atlanta, GA roadway, respectively(3). Regular, mid-grade, and premium gasoline headspace vapor samples contained 3-/4-xylene combined at concentrations 0.30, and 0.32% wt, respectively(3). Whole gas samples, weighted average of all octanes, contained 3-/4-xylene combined, at 6.3 ppbC(4). Hot soak (emissions following driving), cold start (emissions during starting an engine), and roadway (emissions during driving) concentrations of 3-/4-xylene combined, were 1.44, 3.93, and 3.52% wt, respectively(3). Concentrations of 3-/4-xylene combined, in gasoline engine (light duty) exhaust from a noncatalyst and a catalyst-equipped engine were 4.2 and 3.5% wt by comparison to total organic gas emissions, respectively(5). Diesel engine exhaust contained 3-/4-xylene combined, at 0.3% wt by comparison to total organic gas emissions(5). Combined 3-/4-xylene was identified in exhaust gas from 67 vehicles at 6.5% wt/wt non-methane hydrocarbons(6). Forty-six vehicles (1975-1982 models) were tested by the federal test procedure driving cycle (normal urban driving), the hot soak evaporative test, the New York City driving cycle (low speed, represents city driving) and the crowded urban expressway driving (normal high-speed driving) cycle; combined 3-/4-xylene concentrations were 2.7, 2.5, 3.2, and 2.%1 wt of total hydrocarbons, respectively(7). VOC emissions from light-duty vehicles in August (low oxygenate) and October (high oxygenate) contained 3-/4-xylene combined, at concentrations of 5.7 and 4.4% wt of total VOC(8). 3-Xylene was measured in Lincoln Tunnel air at a concentration of 114.1 and 709.3 ppbC in 1982 and 1970, respectively(9).",

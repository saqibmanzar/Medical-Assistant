When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Over the past 20 years, the trend is to manufacture carbonates without the use of phosgene. This method has the advantage of avoiding the use of highly toxic phosgene as well as considerably lower cost. The catalytic insertion of CO2 with oxiranes directly provides the five-membered cyclic carbonate. Oxiranes such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide undergo insertion at ~150-175 \u00b0C under pressure with the aid of a quaternary ammonium salt catalyst to yield ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, respectively.",

Propylene carbonate is used in paints as a high-boiling solvent and film-forming auxiliary, especially in poly(vinyl fluoride) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) systems. It is also employed as an auxiliary in the pigment and dye industry. It is also used In lithium batteries, to decrease sulfur dioxide vapor pressure and increase electrolyte solubility and ionic conductivity. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: In clinical studies, undiluted propylene carbonate caused moderate skin irritation, whereas 5 and 10% propylene carbonate in aqueous solution produced no skin irritation or sensitization. Cosmetic products or gels containing 0.54-20% propylene carbonate were essentially nonsensitizing and, at most, moderately irritating to human skin. Products formulated with 1.51-20% propylene carbonate were generally nonphototoxic and nonphotosensitizing. However, one product containing 20% propylene carbonate may have produced a low level photoallergic reaction in 1 of 25 subjects tested. ANIMAL STUDIES: The undiluted material was a slight irritant to the skin and a moderate irritant to the rabbit eye. In an acute dermal toxicity study, slight erythema was noted  on the abraded skin of rabbits treated with 2 mg/kg of undiluted propylene carbonate; however, no lesions were observed at necropsy. Daily application of 10.5 or 17.5% propylene carbonate in physiological saline to the skin of rats for 1 month produced hyperkeratosis and an increase in the number of basal epithelial cells at the treatment site. Gavage studies in rats for 90 days at concentrations of up to 5,000 mg/kg/d did not induce any significant toxic effects. No systemic toxicity was reported in rats exposed to 100, 500, or 1,000 mg/cu m of aerosol propylene carbonate over a 90-day period. It was found in rat experiments that oral exposure at concentrations up to 5,000 mg/kg/d did not induce developmental toxicity; however, some maternal toxicity was observed in the high-dose group (decreased body weight gain and food consumption). Propylene carbonate was negative for mutagenicity in the Ames Salmonella/Microsome Liquid Pre-incubation Assay, and negative for genotoxicity in the Rat Hepatocyte Primary Culture/DNA Repair Test.",

A control group was given deionized water. In addition, a high-dose recovery group was included to determine the persistence and reversibility of any toxic effects. The recovery group was followed from day 90 of the study through day 118. Thirty rats per group (15 of each sex) and 20 rats in the recovery group were studied. An interim sacrifice of 10 rats per group, excluding the recovery group, was conducted on day 30. At sacrifice, all animals were necropsied and grossly examined. Blood sample were collected for clinical chemistry and hematology measurements, and an ophthalmological examination was performed. A full screen of potential target organ tissues was fixed for histopathological examination. No consistent dose-related findings were reported following necropsy or histopathological examination. Results of the test showed that PC at concentrations of up to 5,000 mg/kg/d did not induce any significant toxic effects.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.045 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propylene carbonate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase propylene carbonate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 days. Propylene carbonate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, propylene carbonate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Propylene carbonate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 79% of the theoretical BOD was reached in four weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, propylene carbonate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate process since this compound contains functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to propylene carbonate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propylene carbonate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to propylene carbonate via dermal contact with consumer products containing propylene carbonate. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase propylene carbonate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.8X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Propylene carbonate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

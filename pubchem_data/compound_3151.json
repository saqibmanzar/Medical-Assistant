Several meta-analyses of domperidone use as a galactogogue in mothers of preterm infants concluded that domperidone can increase milk production acutely in the range of 90 to 94 mL daily. Other reviewers concluded that improvement of breastfeeding practices seems more effective and safer than off-label use of domperidone. One retrospective study found that breastmilk feeding rates at discharge remained consistently lower in very preterm (<32 weeks gestation) infants of women dispensed domperidone than those who were not prescribed domperidone.",

Most published studies have used domperidone in a dosage of 10 mg 3 times daily for 4 to 10 days. Two small studies found no statistically significant additional increase in milk output with a dosage of 20 mg 3 times daily compared to a dosage of 10 mg 3 times and that women who failed to respond to the low dosage did not respond to the higher dosage. Dosages greater than 30 mg daily may increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients receiving domperidone, although some feel that the risk is less in nursing mothers because of their relatively younger age. Large database retrospective cohort studies in Canada found an increase in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, but some confounders make the results subject to question. In one case, domperidone use uncovered congenital long QT syndrome in a woman who developed loss of consciousness, behavioral arrest, and jerking while taking domperidone. Mothers with a history of cardiac arrhythmias should not receive domperidone and all mothers should be advised to stop taking domperidone and seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs or symptoms of an abnormal heart rate or rhythm while taking domperidone, including dizziness, palpitations, syncope or seizures.",

Surveys of women taking domperidone for lactation enhancement found gastrointestinal symptoms, breast engorgement, weight gain, headache, dizziness, irritability, dry mouth and fatigue were the most common side effects reported. One mother taking domperidone 20 mg three times daily as a galactogogue for feeding her adoptive daughter developed obsessional thoughts with adjustment disorder. This manifested as thoughts of killing her daughter. Stopping domperidone and instituting duloxetine therapy resulted in remission over a 10-month period.",

Canadian labeling warns against use of domperidone doses greater than 30 mg daily for longer than 4 weeks. Drug withdrawal symptoms consisting of insomnia, anxiety, and tachycardia were reported in a woman taking 80 mg of domperidone daily for 8 months as a galactogogue who abruptly tapered the dosage over 3 days. Another mother took domperidone 10 mg three times daily for 10 months as a galactagogue and stopped abruptly. After discontinuation, she experienced severe insomnia, severe anxiety, severe cognitive problems and depression. A third postpartum woman began domperidone 90 mg daily, increasing to 160 mg daily to increase her milk supply. Because her milk supply did not improve, she stopped nursing at 14 weeks and began to taper the domperidone dosage by 10 mg every 3 to 4 days. Seven days after discontinuing domperidone, she began experiencing insomnia, rigors, severe psychomotor agitation, and panic attacks. She restarted the drug at 90 mg daily and tapered the dose by 10 mg daily each week. At a dose of 20 mg daily, the same symptoms recurred. She required sertraline, clonazepam and reinstitution of domperidone at 40 mg daily, slowly tapering the dose over 8 weeks. Three months were required to fully resolve her symptoms. In a fourth case, a mother took domperidone 20 mg four times daily for 9 months to stimulate breastmilk production. She stopped breastfeeding and domperidone at that time. Two weeks later, she presented with insomnia, anxiety, nausea, headaches and palpitations. The drug was restarted at a dosage of 20 mg three times daily and began to taper the daily dosage by 10 mg every week, but after one week she complained of insomnia. Tapering was reduced to 5 mg every week, but whenever she stopped the drug, symptoms returned. She was able to discontinue domperidone after tapering the daily dosage by 2.5 mg weekly over 10 months. A fifth case of a mother with a history of bipolar disorder and major depression developed severe anxiety, a recurrence of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder 6 days after abruptly discontinuing domperidone 120 mg daily that she was taking as a galactogogue. Three days later, she restarted domperidone 120 mg daily and tapered her daily dose by 10 mg at weekly intervals. She took no other medications. Two weeks after discontinuing domperidone, she had signs of only mild mood disorder. Three patients were reported to have severe symptoms of withdrawal (depression, reemergence of obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, loss of libido, lack of energy, suicidality, hot flashes, night sweats, hair thinning, and dry eyes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decreased appetite) after stopping domperidone as a galactogogue. Dosages ranged from 90 to 150 mg daily for 5 to 32 weeks. Dosages required a slow hyperbolic tapering over a period of several months to fully discontinue the drug.",

The patients were apparently not randomized and blinding was not mentioned in the paper. No instruction or support in breastfeeding technique was provided.

Suckling-induced serum prolactin increases were higher in the treated women than in the placebo group from day 2 postpartum onward. Milk yield was calculated by weighing the infants before and after each nursing for 24 hours. Increase in milk yield were greater in the treated mothers from day 2 onward; however, the lower average milk yield in the placebo group was due to 3 women with very low milk output. Average infant weight gain was correspondingly greater in the treated group. At 1 month postpartum, all treated mothers were nursing well, but 5 of 7 untreated mothers had inadequate (not defined) lactation.

Twenty women who were pumping milk with a good quality electric pump for their preterm infants were given either oral domperidone 10 mg (n = 11) or placebo (n = 9) 3 times daily for 7 days in a randomized, double-blind, trial. The mothers averaged 32 to 33 days postpartum. All had failed to produce sufficient milk for their infant after extensive counseling by lactation consultants. By day 5 of therapy, the serum prolactin levels of the treated mothers had increased by 119 mcg/L in the treated group compared to 18 mcg/L in the placebo group. Serum prolactin decreased to baseline levels in both groups 3 days after discontinuation of the study medications. Although the (partially imputed) baseline milk production was greater in the domperidone group (113 mL daily) than in the placebo group (48 mL daily), the average daily increases in milk production on days 2 to 7 were 45% (to 184 mL) and 17% (to 66 mL) in the domperidone and placebo groups, respectively. However, 4 women in the domperidone group failed to complete the study and only the study completers were matched and found to be similar at baseline. No follow-up beyond the 7-day study period was done to evaluate the persistence of an effect of domperidone on lactation success. While this study appears to offer evidence of a beneficial effect on the milk supply in the mothers of preterm infants who are pumping their milk, several factors make this conclusion questionable: a 36% drop-out rate in the active drug group, the lack of an intent-to-treat analysis, and the vast difference in baseline milk supply between the domperidone and placebo groups.",

Only mothers with documented low milk production were entered into the trial and breastfeeding support was provided to all mothers. Seventy-eight percent of mothers who received domperidone in the first 2 weeks had a 50% increase in milk supply compared to 58% who received placebo (odds ratio 2.56). At the end of 4 weeks, the values were 69% and 62%, but the difference was not statistically significant. At 6 weeks post term gestation, there was no appreciable difference between the groups in the numbers of mothers providing milk to their infants or supplementing with formula. The authors concluded that domperidone supported more mothers to increase their milk volume as early as 8 to 21 days postdelivery; however, the gain in volume was modest. In a secondary analysis of study results, the authors found no difference in response between mothers of infants born between 23 and 26 weeks of gestation and mothers of infants born between 27 and 29 weeks of gestation. Other secondary analyses of the data found no difference in outcome regardless of whether domperidone was started during the period of days 8 to 14 or days 15 to 21 postpartum. Mothers with initial volumes of milk of 200 mL/day or less had the greatest percentage of increase in milk volume, but those with initial milk volumes of 100 mL/day or less had continuing low absolute milk volumes.",

In order to prepare for the birth of the infant being carried by her partner, sublingual estradiol was increased to 6 mg twice daily and progesterone was increased to 400 mg at bedtime. Domperidone 10 mg twice daily was also started to increase serum prolactin levels and later increased to 20 mg 4 times daily. Before the delivery date, progesterone was stopped, spironolactone was decreased to 100 mg daily and estradiol was changed to 25 mcg per day transdermally. At day 59 postpartum, estradiol was changed to 2 mg per day sublingually and spironolactone was increased to 100 mg twice daily. The patient was able to produce up to 240 mL of milk daily containing typical macronutrient and oligosaccharide levels.",

Plook-Fire-Thatu contains several herbs from the genus Piper (pepper) and piperine may be the active ingredient. Piperine also enhances the bioavailability of some chemicals. Ginger, which is a purported galactogogue, is also included in the formula. Milk output was measured by test weighing infants three times daily. On day 3 of treatment, the herbal product resulted in a greater increase in milk production than placebo or domperidone, but there was no difference in infant weights between groups. Maternal temperatures were greater in the herbal group, which is in accord with the Chinese theory of increasing heat to improve lactation.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

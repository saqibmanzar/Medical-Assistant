Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In the case of dichloromethane the carbon monoxide appears to arise from formyl halide. This intermediate, as an alternative to losing carbon monoxide, can covalently bind to cellular protein or lipid. The involvement of nonmicrosomal enzymes in dihalomethane biotransformation leads to prodn of formaldehyde & halide. A necessary step is the reaction of dihalomethane with glutathione, which results in loss of one halide. The resulting halomethylglutathione is postulated to undergo nonenzymatic hydrolytic dehalogenation leaving hydroxymethylglutathione. The next step would result in the release of the hydroxymethyl group as formaldehyde. Alternatively it has been shown that in the presence of formaldehyde dehydrogenase & NAD /nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide/ formic acid can be formed. /Dichloromethane/",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Natural production by marine algae also adds to its environmental input. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 44.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibromomethane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dibromomethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 142 days. If released to soil, dibromomethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 24. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.22X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Dibromomethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. No significant biotic or abiotic degradative processes have been reported in natural waters or soil. However, catalyzed photolysis may occur in surface layers of some natural waters or soil. If released into water, dibromomethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is estimated to be an extremely slow process. Occupational exposure to dibromomethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dibromomethane is produced or used. The general population will be exposed to low levels of dibromomethane in the atmosphere from both natural and anthropogenic sources. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.22X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 6 days, respectively(SRC). Biodegradation potential in water is unknown(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 4(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.70(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The rate constant for the aqueous-phase reaction of dibromomethane with hydroxyl radicals is 9.9X10+7(8). This corresponds to a half-life of about 22 years at an aqueous concn of 1X10-17 mole/L hydroxyl radicals cm.",

Vapor-phase dibromomethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 142 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.13X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The ozone depleting potential and atmospheric lifetime for dibromomethane have been calculated as 0.17 and 0.41 years, respectively(3). Dibromomethane is very soluble in water (11,900 g/l at 30 \u00b0C(4)) and therefore it should be readily scavenged by rain and snow(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

However levels and distribution of the chemical were not reported. Surface seawater concns of dibromomethane at a site in the South Atlantic, and two sites in the North Atlantic (south of the Canary Islands and west of the Strait of Gibraltar) were 0.26, >1, and 0.3 ng/l(2). In Lake Ontario, dibromomethane was detected in 66% of the 82 stations that were sampled(3). Only 8 samples contained more than trace amounts of dibromomethane and the highest level was 7 parts per trillion. The detection limit was 0.7 parts per trillion. Dibromomethane was detected in surface water samples collected from 58 stations in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean between April 27 and May 31, 1991 at concns ranging from approximately 0.1 to 1.4(4). Dibromomethane was detected in 34 surface water samples collected in the antarctic between October and December of 1987 at concns ranging from 0.38-4.44 ng/l with a mean of 0.94 ng/l(5). Dibromomethane was detected in 3 of 136 samples collected from 30 sites along the lower reach of the Yodo River and its tributaries and the lower reaches of the Neyagawa River basin, near Osaka, Japan between August 1993 and February 1995 at concns between approximately 0.15 and 7 ug/l(6).",

The level of dibromomethane in air decreases with altitude to 1.2 parts per trillion/volume above the marine boundary layer and tradewind inversion(1). Air samples were collected in the South and North Atlantic on a cruise from Capetown to Bremerhaven, on the Azores, Madeira, Bermuda, and Tenerife. The dibromomethane concns reported ranged from 0.8 to 4 parts per trillion/volume with the exception of the beach at Sao Miguel, the Azores which was 50 parts per trillion/volume(1). The concn of dibromomethane measured across the Arctic from Anchorage, AK to Norway and the North Pole during March and April 1983 ranged from 3-60 parts per trillion/volume with a mean of 15 (standard deviation= 12) parts per trillion/volume(3). The monthly average concn of dibromomethane at Point Barrows, AK during 1983 ranged from 4.7 to 5.6 parts per trillion/volume(2). The concn within the Arctic haze that seasonally occurs in Point Barrows is estimated to be 4.2 parts per trillion/volume, while that outside the haze is 2.5 parts per trillion/volume(2). The concn is highest in winter and spring at which times meteorological and atmospheric conditions favor the formation of Arctic haze(2,3). This suggests that dibromomethane may be transported from industrial sources in the mid-latitudes(2). Dibromomethane was measured in background Arctic air and in Arctic haze between March 31 and April 4, 1984 (4). The difference in concn of dibromomethane between the background air and haze was measured as 1.7 parts per trillion/volume(4). Dibromomethane was detected in 67 air samples collected in the Antarctic between October and December of 1987 at concns ranging from 0.3-8.6 parts per trillion/volume with a mean of 3.7 parts per trillion/volume (5). Dibromomethane was detected in air samples collected during three sampling efforts: in the western Pacific between January 31 and February 1991 at concns ranging from 0.47-1.36 parts per trillion/volume, with a mean of 0.87 (n=23); in the western Pacific between September and October 1992 at concns ranging from 0.14-1.58 parts per trillion/volume with a mean of 0.59 parts per trillion/volume (n=48); and in the East China Sea, South China Sea and Bay of Bengal between January and March 1994 at concns ranging from 0.38-1.42 parts per trillion/volume, with a mean of 0.77 parts per trillion/volume (n=73)(6).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Radioassays utilized the liver, kidneys, spleen, brain, pancreas, lung, heart, thigh muscle, skin, perirenal fat, testes, bladder, adrenals, epididymis, seminal vesicles, prostate, gastrointestinal tract, blood, and salivary glands. The data for each tissue was fitted to a linear compartmental pharmacokinetic model. The amount of (14)C excreted in urine and feces was determined daily for 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene and 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene isomers. Radioactivity from the labeled isomers appeared in the blood and tissues within 30 min of administration, peaked at approximately 4 hr, and slowly declined to background levels. Radioactivity attributed to 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene dropped to background levels after 28 days. The bladder, kidney, fat, skin, liver, and adrenals showed high 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene activity up to 24 hr post treatment. Radioactivity due to 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene dropped to background levels after 56 days for liver, fat, and skin and 28 days for the other tissues. The highest 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene concentrations were found in liver, fat, kidney, and bladder. Significant levels of radioactivity from 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene remained in the tissues after 56 days for all tissues examined. Approximately 85% of the 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene and 92% of the 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene were excreted within 24 hr of dosing. Compartmental analysis showed 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene to have the highest values for the linear coefficients of exponential decay.",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Thirteen groups of weanling Sprague Dawley rats were given one of the trichlorobenzenes, at concentrations of 1, 10, 100, or 1000 ppm in corn oil, or corn oil alone. After 13 wk all animals were anesthetized with ether and exsanguinated via the abdominal aorta. Clinical examination showed no signs of toxicity except reduced weight gain in some groups. High dose groups of treated males had a general trend towards lower weight gain with statistically significant weight gain suppression only seen in males treated with 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene at 10 of 1000 ppm. The liver to body weight ratios of males receiving the highest doses of the three trichlorobenzenes were significantly higher than controls. Kidney weights were higher for some groups of males. Trichlorobenzene exposure did not affect serum sodium, potassium, inorganic phosphate, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transferase, total protein, calcium, cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, or any hematological or urinary parameter. Hepatic microsomal aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine demethylase activities were significantly elevated in males fed 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 1000 ppm. Aminopyrine demethylase activity was significantly elevated in females. Histopathologic changes related to treatment were seen in liver, thyroid, and kidney for all three isomers. The changes were mild in nature and judged to be significant only at the highest dose level, but they were more severe in males than in females. Microscopic changes in the liver consisted of mild to moderate increases in cytoplasmic volume and anisokaryosis of hepatocytes. Changes in the thyroid included reduction in both follicular size and colloid density. Only 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene resulted in mild to moderate renal changes in the convoluted tubules which were characterized by eosinophilic inclusions, enlargement and anisokaryosis of the lining cells and hyperplasia of the tubular epithelial cells. Only changes associated with the 1000 ppm dose level of the isomer were considered to be biologically significant. ...",

Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were administered 150 and 300 mg/kg of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, or 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg of 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene or 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene. Chemicals were given by gavage on day six through day 15 of gestation. Dams were assessed for toxic effects and distribution of chemicals in tissues, and fetuses were examined for toxic and teratogenic effects. Dams did not exhibit any signs of toxicity, although there was a tendency toward a dose related reduction in body weight. Abnormalities in pregnancy outcome and fetal development did not appear to be related to treatment. Maternal liver weights were increased by all three isomers, and other organ weights were normal. Significant dose related increases in liver aminopyrine-N-demethylase activity were found for 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. Dose related decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit occurred with all three compounds. Histology revealed maternal liver changes and eye lens lesions in 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene exposed fetuses. Mild thyroid changes were also noted in dams.",

The concn of the chemical, at which the proliferation of Tetrahymena pyriformis was restricted to one-half of the blank test (EC50), was determined. The method, applied to 57 chemicals /including 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene/, demonstrated that it could be used to detect the chemicals at low concn rapidly and with ease. The EC50 values showed a good relationship with 48 hr LC50 values for Himedaka (Oryzias latipes), and could be explained on the basis of the partition coefficient between water and n-octanol.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.24 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 24 days. 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene has been shown to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene is expected to have low to no mobility based upon log Koc values of 2.8 to 3.82. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.89X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 1,3,5-Trichlorobenzene is expected to biodegrade slowly in soil and water with biodegradation half-lives ranging from several weeks to months. If released into water, 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Kocs. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.6 hours and 5.5 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 50 days if adsorption is considered. BCFs of 150 to 14,000 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene via ingestion of food. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.89X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.6 hours and 5.5 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 50 days if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), BCFs of 150(8) to 14,000(9), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). 1,3,5-Trichlorobenzene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Biodegradation of 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene is expected to occur slowly, with half-lives ranging from several weeks to months(10-12).",

The half-life of 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene in sewage sludge amended soil was 24 days(4). 1,3,5-Trichlorobenzene showed no biodegradation when incubated in sediment from freshwater streams in the Netherlands(5). 1,3,5-Trichlorobenzene was found to be persistent when a concn of 28 uM was incubated for 4 days(6).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

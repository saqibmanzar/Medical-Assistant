Among the three P450s, 1A1 was the most effective in metabolizing DB(a,h)ACR followed by 1B1 and 3A4. The major DB(a,h)ACR metabolites produced by human P450 1A1 and 1B1 were the dihydrodiols with a bay region double bond, namely, DB(a,h)ACR-3,4-diol and DB(a,h)ACR-10,11-diol (putative proximate carcinogen). P450 1A1 produced a higher proportion of DB(a,h)ACR-10,11-diol (derived from the benzo ring adjacent to the nitrogen) (44.7%) than of DB(a,h)ACR-3,4-diol (derived from benzo ring away from the nitrogen) (23.8%). In contrast, 1B1 produced a much greater proportion of 3,4-diol (54.7%) than of 10,11-diol (6.4%). These data indicate that (i) human P450 1A1 and 1B1 differ dramatically with respect to the regiospecific metabolism of DB(a,h)ACR, (ii) human P450 1A1 is substantially more active than human P450 1B1 in the metabolic activation of the aza-PAH to its 10,11-diol, and (iii) the presence of nitrogen influences the relative extent to which the two benzo ring diols with a bay region double bond are formed by human P450s 1A1 and 1B1. In contrast to human P450s 1A1 and 1B1, rat P450 1A1 showed no regioselectivity in the metabolism of DB(a,h)ACR producing nearly equal proportions of 10,11-diol and 3,4-diol. Despite significant differences in their regioselectivity, human P450 1A1 and 1B1 and rat P450 1A1 showed similar stereoselectivity in the metabolism of DB(a,h)ACR to its diols having a bay region double bond, producing primarily the R,R enantiomers (>94%). The data of these studies indicate that human and rat P450 1A1 differ in their regioselectivity in the metabolism of DB(a,h)ACR to its two benzo ring diols with a bay region double bond and consequently in their ability to metabolically activate the parent aza-PAH. However, human and rat P450 1A1 do not differ with respect to their stereoselectivity in the metabolism of DB(a,h)ACR to the diols.",

In the present investigation, the stereoselectivity of rat liver enzymes in metabolism of DB(a,h)ACR to its 3,4-diol and 10,11-diol and of DB(a,h)ACR-10,11-diol enantiomers to their bay-region diol epoxides has been examined with liver microsomes from control and 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats. Both microsomal preparations produced the major metabolites DB(a,h)ACR-3,4-diol and DB(a,h)ACR-10,11-diol containing predominantly R,R-enantiomers with 38-54% optical purity. Metabolism of (-)-(10R,11R)- and (+)-(10S,11S)-enantiomers of DB(a,h)ACR-10,11-diol by liver microsomes from control rats produced predominantly bay-region diol epoxides (46-59% of total metabolites), whereas very little bay-region diol epoxides (14-17% of total metabolites) were produced by liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats. The bay-region diol epoxides produced in these studies consisted of predominantly DB(a,h)ACR-10,11-trans-diol epoxide diastereomer in which the benzylic hydroxyl group and epoxide oxygen are trans. However, (-)-DB(a,h)ACR-10R,11R-diol, a major metabolite of DB(a,h)ACR, was metabolized by liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats to (+)-(8R,9S,10S,11R)-DB(a,h)ACR-10,11-trans-diol epoxide ... in an amount which was 6.5-fold greater than that of the corresponding cis-diol epoxide diastereomer. The relative amounts of trans-diol epoxide versus cis-diol epoxide in the mixture of bay-region diol epoxides produced from DB(a,h)ACR-10R,11R-diol and DB(a,h)ACR-10S,11R-diol with liver microsomes from control rats and from DB(a,h)ACR-10S,11S-diol with liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats were 1.7, 2.1 and 2.3 respectively.",

During a 6-min incubation 21, 14, 0.7 or 0.2 nmol DB(a,h)AC per mg protein were metabolized by microsomes from rats pre-treated with DB(a,h)AC, 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC), phenobarbital (PB) or corn oil, respectively. In each case the predominant metabolites were the dihydrodiols with bay-region double bonds, namely, DB(a,h)AC-3,4-dihydrodiol and DB(a,h)AC-10,11-dihydrodiol, each of which accounted for 21-23% of the total metabolism determined during a 7-min incubation with microsomes from 3-MC-treated rats. Other metabolites produced by these microsomes included DB(a,h)AC-1,2-dihydrodiol (approximately 5% of total metabolites); two K-region oxides (DB(a,h)AC-12,13- and 5,6-oxides (estimated to represent 5% and 2% of total metabolites, respectively)); several unidentified polar metabolites (10-15%) and several unidentified metabolites which co-eluted with 3-hydroxy-DB(a,h)AC (20%). DB(a,h)AC-8,9-dihydrodiol was not detected (less than 2%). The metabolite profiles produced by microsomes prepared from rats pretreated with DB(a,h)AC, PB or corn oil were very similar to the profile produced by 3-MC-induced microsomes. /Investigators/ conclude that: the potentially mutagenic benzo-ring dihydrodiols with bay-region double bonds are the predominant metabolite of DB(a,h)AC; the heterocyclic nitrogen atom has little effect in modifying the relative extents of formation of these two benzo-ring dihydrodiols with bay-region double bonds; metabolism at the K-region is only a minor pathway for DB(a,h)AC, as is also true for the carbon analogue dibenz(a,h)anthracene; and induction by a 3-MC-type inducer (e.g. DB(a,h)AC) is required for substantial metabolism to occur.",

It is also found in cigarette smoke condensate. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.5X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibenz(a,h)acridine will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase dibenz(a,h)acridine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Dibenz(a,h)acridine absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dibenz(a,h)acridine is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 9.4X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Dibenz(a,h)acridine may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Utilizing activated sludge from 3 municipal treatment plants, 0.3-9.3% of the theoretical oxygen demand was reached in 144 hours, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, dibenz(a,h)acridine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF of 100 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to dibenz(a,h)acridine is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from combustion fuels, incineration effluent, automobile exhaust, and cigarette smoke.

An experimental log BCF of 2.03 in fish has been reported (specific test conditions were not specified)(2), corresponding to a BCF of 107(SRC). According to a classification scheme(3), these BCF values suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Minnows exposed to (14)C-labeled dibenz(a,h)acridine rapidly accumulated this compound to the above level reaching an apparent equilibrium after 24 hours. Metabolite concentrations in the fish continued to build up and exceeded the level of dibenz(a,h)acridine in the tissues. The uptake rate coefficient for dibenz(a,h)acridine in fathead minnows was 11.48/hour while the elimination coefficient was 0.140/hour(1).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Urban atmospheric air from Tokyo showed dibenz(a,h)acridine at a concentration of 0.36 ug/g of particulates; this compares to a concentration of 0.6 ug/g of particulates measured in the United States and a concentration of 50 ug/g of particulates measured for coal tar pitch polluted air(2). Dibenzacridines were detected during the measurement of aerosols in Belgium at two monitoring stations from 1976-1979. The mass median equivalent diameter ranged from 0.61-1.2 um(3). The concentration of dibenz(a,h)acridine in the average American urban atmosphere was determined to be 0.6 ug/g airborne particles or 0.08 ug/1000 m cu air(5) up to 0.2 ug/cu m(6).",

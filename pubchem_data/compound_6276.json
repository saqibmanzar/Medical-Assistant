When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

The concentration-effect relations followed Michaelis-Menten equations, complying with receptor mediated processes. The relations were transformed into nearly rectilinear relationships in log concentration-effect plots, and the extrapolated threshold concentrations (RD-0) from the lines were 120, 28, 640 and 1210 ppm, respectively, obtained from the first 2 min of the exposure period. These values were comparable to those found in Swiss-Webster mice and to those obtained by electrophysiological experiments in Sprague-Dawley rats. The hydrophobic properties of the receptor biophase were found to approach that of the internal part of the bilayer membrane. Estimates on threshold limit values (TLV) were obtained and were found in reasonable agreement with the established values. The nose has a scrubbing effect, which reduces the concentration in the lungs in normal mice. n-Pentanol, sec-butanol and tert-pentanol decreased tidal volume in normal mice, explained either by an activation of receptors in the upper airways or by a sensitization of the stretch receptors. Two types of pulmonary responses were seen in tracheal-cannulated mice, which could be explained by an effect on stretch receptors and another type of lung receptors.",

The response of Tetrahymena exposed to different nonpolar narcotics varied from a change in generation time to a change in lag phase with similar generation time compared to control. Two narcotics with high (>3.00), intermediate (>0.00 and <3.00), and low log Kow (<0. 00) values were tested. Growth of Tetrahymena inhibited up to 85% by the high log Kow toxicants (2-decanone and butylbenzene) grew with similar rates as the control, but exhibited increased lag time, suggesting that the protozoan became acclimated to toxicant stress. Results from growth of Tetrahymena in the low log Kow toxicants (ethanol and acetone) indicate an increased generation time with increasing concentration. Cells inhibited by the intermediate log Kow chemicals, 1-pentanol and anisole, exhibited a response that was a combination of the previously mentioned two contrary responses. Cells inhibited <35% with 1-pentanol and <50% with anisole grew with similar generation times as control flasks, whereas in cells inhibited >35% or >50%, respectively, the doubling times were longer than control growth.",

It also occurs in volatile components of many foods. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-pentyl alcohol will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-pentyl alcohol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. If released to soil, n-pentyl alcohol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 160. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. n-Pentyl alcohol may also volatilize from dry soil surfaces based on its vapor pressure. Screening studies using sewage inoculum suggests that n-pentyl alcohol will degrade readily in the environment under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. If released into water, n-pentyl alcohol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 43 hours and 23 days, respectively. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound does not contain functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to n-pentyl alcohol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-pentyl alcohol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-pentyl alcohol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

Volatilization of n-pentyl alcohol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). The potential for volatilization of n-pentyl alcohol from dry soil surfaces may exist (SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 2.2 mm Hg(5). Screening studies using sewage inoculum(6-9) suggest that n-pentyl alcohol will readily degrade in soils under aerobic and anaerobic conditions(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4) Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 43 hours and 23 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). The rate constant for the reaction of n-pentyl alcohol with hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solution has a maximum value of 4.8X10+9/M-sec at a pH of 5(7,8). Based on this rate constant and a value of 10-17 M for the concentration of hydroxyl radical in eutrophic water(9), the half-life of n-pentyl alcohol due to this reaction can be estimated to be 56 days. Therefore, this reaction should not be important in water(SRC). Biodegradation tests of n-pentyl alcohol with sewage and activated sludge(10-13) indicate that aerobic biodegradation will occur in natural water. Biodegradation tests under anaerobic conditions(14,15) suggests that biodegradation of the compound should occur in anaerobic water and sediment(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of 2 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm. The rate constant for the reaction of n-pentyl alcohol with hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solution has a maximum value of 4.8X10+9/M-sec at a pH of 5(2,3). Based on this rate constant and a value of 10-17 M for the concentration of hydroxyl radical in eutrophic water(4), the half-life of n-pentyl alcohol due to this reaction can be estimated to be 56 days. Therefore, this reaction should not be important in water(SRC). n-Pentyl alcohol does not contain any functional group that are amenable to hydrolysis(5). Similarly, n-pentyl alcohol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(1) and the longest wavelength absorption band in the alcohols occur at wavelength below 200 nm(6). Therefore, n-pentyl alcohol is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

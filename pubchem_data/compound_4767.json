It has also been used to kill head lice in humans. d-phenothrin is used as a component of aerosol insecticides for domestic use. Phenothrin is often used with methoprene, an insect growth regulator that interrupts the insect's biological life cycle by killing the eggs. In 2005, the EPA required Hartz Mountain Industries to cancel uses of several flea and tick products containing phenothrin that were linked to a range of adverse reactions, including hair loss, salivation, tremors, and numerous deaths in cats and kittens. In the short term, the agreement called for new warning labels on the products. A pyrethroid is a synthetic chemical compound similar to the natural chemical pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids are common in commercial products such as household insecticides and insect repellents. In the concentrations used in such products, they are generally harmless to human beings but can harm sensitive individuals. They are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, and do not significantly affect groundwater quality except for being toxic to fish. (L811, L865)",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

In the comparative study of the phenothrin and malathion lotions an inspection on the day following treatment showed no live lice remained, but that six of the subjects treated with malathion lotion still had evidence of viable eggs (p < 0.05). In one subject viable eggs were still evident at two weeks post-treatment. There were no cases, however, of live lice or viable eggs at four weeks post-treatment. Mild cutaneous side-effects were reported in five subjects, the incidence of which was not significantly different by treatment group. One subject in the phenothrin and carbaryl lotion comparative study had evidence of live lice at one week post-treatment with phenothrin lotion. This subject received no further treatment and was clear of both live lice and viable eggs at subsequent visits. A separate case of live lice infestation was found at two weeks post-treatment in a subject treated with phenothrin lotion and at four weeks post-treatment in two subjects treated with carbaryl lotion. As these subjects were free of live lice infestation at previous follow-up visits it was highly probable that these were cases of re-infestation from another source.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

It is rapidly metabolized and excreted by humans and has low human toxicity.  For both cis- and trans- isomers, the product was metabolized by hydrolysis, oxidation and conjugation and a large part of d-Phenothrin is excreted unchanged in the urine and the faeces.   Following oral administration of the (1R)- trans - isomer, the urine is the major excretory route.  The isomer is extensively metabolized to oxidative and conjugated derivatives of the hydrolysed ester.  Oxidative and conjugated derivatives of the\n(1R)- cis -isomer are also observed but hydrolysis of the ester linkage is a minor metabolic pathway.  With this isomer the faeces is the major excretory route. The metabolic profiles aree similar following dermal application, although the rates of excretion for each isomer showed some differences between the two routes of administration.  The major metabolite is 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol (PBalc). Smaller amounts of PBacid and trace amounts of 4'-OH-PBacid are also found.  It is stable to storage in the dark; d-Phenothrin is relatively unstable to sunlight or ultra violet irradiation, or in alkaline media. (L866, A561)",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The declining phase of the sodium current during depolarization was markedly slowed down and after repolarization of the membrane a large, slowly decaying sodium tail current developed. Pyrethroids did not affect the sodium current reversal potential, steady-state sodium inactivation or recovery from sodium channel inactivation. The amplitude of the pyrethroid-induced slow tail current was always proportional to the sodium current at the end of the preceding depolarizing pulse. The rate of decay of the slow tail current strongly depended on pyrethroid structure and increased in the order deltamethrin, cyphenothrin, fenfluthrin and phenothrin. The rate of decay further depended on membrane potential and temperature. Below -85 m V the instantaneous current-voltage relationship of the slow tail current showed a negative slope conductance. The tail current decayed more slowly at low temperatures. Arrhenius plots indicated that the relaxation of open sodium channels to a closed state involved a higher energy barrier for pyrethroid-affected than for normal channels. The energy barrier was higher after deltamethrin than after the non-cyano pyrethroid fenfluthrin. It is concluded that in mammalian neuronal membrane pyrethroids selectively reduce the rate of closing of sodium channels both during depolarization and after repolarization of the nerve membrane.",

Based on the data, the Agency has sufficient information on the human health and ecological effects of phenothrin to make its decision on the reregistration process under FIFRA. The Agency has determined that products containing phenothrin will be eligible for reregistration provided that (i) required product specific data are submitted; (ii) the risk mitigation measures outlined in ... /the Reregistration Eligibility Decision/ document are adopted; and (iii) label amendments are made to reflect these measures. ...

Accordingly, should a registrant fail to implement any of the label changes identified in ... /the Reregistration Eligibility Decisiion/ document, the Agency may take regulatory action to address the risk concerns from the use of phenothrin.

Phenothrin is found on List A, which contains most pesticides that are used on foods and, hence, have a high potential for human exposure. List A consists of the 194 chemical cases (or 350 individual active ingredients) for which EPA issued registration standards prior to FIFRA '88. Case No: 0426; Pesticide type: insecticide; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document.; Active  ingredient (AI): Phenothrin; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s):  10/13/95; AI Status:  The producers of the pesticide have made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. They also inhibit calium channels and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase. (T10, T18, L857)",

If irritant or paresthetic effects occur, obtain treatment by a physician. Because volatilization of pyrethroids apparently accounts for paresthesia affecting the face, strenuous measures should be taken (ventilation, protective face mask and hood) to avoid vapor contact with the face and eyes. Vitamin E oil preparations (dL-alpha tocopheryl acetate) are uniquely effective in preventing and stopping the paresthetic reaction. They are safe for application to the skin under field conditions. Corn oil is somewhat effective, but possible side effects with continuing use make it less suitable. Vaseline is less effective than corn oil. Zinc oxide actually worsens the reaction. /Pyrethroids/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.43X10-7 mm Hg at 21 \u00b0C indicates phenothrin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase phenothrin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-live for these reactions in air are estimated to be 4 hours and 38 minutes, respectively. Particulate-phase phenothrin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Oxygen species are involved in the photodegradation of phenothrin on glass, suggesting that phenothrin may be susceptible to photodegradation by sunlight. If released to soil, phenothrin is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.25X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Phenothrin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, phenothrin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 days and 81 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 120 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 230 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis half-lives for the d-trans-phenothrin are 301, 495-578, and 91-120 days at pH values of 5, 7 and 9, respectively; the compound is susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis. Occupational exposure to phenothrin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where phenothrin is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to phenothrin via dermal contact with consumer products containing phenothrin. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(2), based upon its vapor pressure, 1.43X10-7 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 9.7X10-3 mg/L(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 days and 81 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 120 years if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 230(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC).",

Vapor-phase phenothrin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.06X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). The half-life for the vapor-phase reaction of phenothrin with ozone has been estimated as about 38 minutes at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(4). Particulate-phase phenthrin may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

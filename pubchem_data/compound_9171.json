When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Among the glucuronidation reactions of PAH metabolites studied, mono- and diglucuronide formation of benzo[a]pyrene and chrysene-3,6-diphenol showed the highest induction factors in rat liver microsomes. Availability of AHH-1 cells stably expressing UGT1A7 allowed us to study whether this PAH-inducible isoform could catalyze benzo[a]pyrene and chrysene-3,6-diphenol glucuronidation. It was found that UGT1A7 indeed catalyzed mono- and diglucuronide formation of both benzo[a]pyrene and chrysene 3,6-diphenols. V79 cell-expressed rat UGT1A6 also catalyzed these reactions, except for chrysene diphenol diglucuronide formation. Enzyme kinetic studies of the glucuronidation of 6-hydroxychrysene (used as a stable PAH phenol) indicated that UGT1A7 conjugated this compound with a lower apparent Km value (0.1 uM) than UGT1A6 (10 uM). The results suggest that the two PAH-inducible UGTs may cooperate in conjugating PAH metabolites, but that UGT1A7 is more efficient.",

The bile metabolites were deconjugated by enzymatic hydrolysis and separated by reverse-phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. The major metabolite present in all fish was 1-hydroxy pyrene (75-94% of all metabolites detected) with lower proportions of 1-hydroxy chrysene (2-15%) and 1-hydroxy phenanthrene (2-8%), and small amounts of three benzo[a]pyrene derivatives (<3%). Metabolite concentrations (normalized to biliverdin content) were significantly higher in common eels than in the other two species and tended to be higher in all species at the beginning of the year than at the end. The data confirm the importance of 1-hydroxy pyrene as the key PAH metabolite in fish bile and suggest that the common eel is an ideal species for monitoring PAHs in estuarine environments.",

The liver microsomes from untreated and 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC)-treated brown bullheads metabolized chrysene at the rate of 30.1 and 82.2 pmol/mg protein/min, respectively. Benzo-ring diols (1,2-diol and 3,4-diol) were the major chrysene metabolites formed by liver microsomes from control and 3-MC-treated fish. However, the control microsomes produced a considerably higher proportion of chrysene 1,2-diol (benzo-ring diol with a bay region double bond) plus 1-hydroxychrysene, than 3,4-diol plus 3-hydroxychrysene, indicating that these microsomes are selective in attacking the 1,2- position of the benzo-ring. On the other hand, 3-MC-induced microsomes did not show such a regioselectivity in the metabolism of chrysene. Control bullhead liver microsomes, compared to control rat liver microsomes, produced a considerably higher proportion of chrysene 1,2-diol, the putative proximate carcinogenic metabolite of chrysene. Like rat liver microsomes, bullhead liver microsomes produced only trace amounts of the K-region diol.Chrysene 1,2-diol and 3,4-diol formed by the liver microsomes from both control and 3-MC-treated bullheads consisted predominantly of their R,R-enantiomers. Chrysene is metabolized by bullhead liver microsomal enzymes to its benzo-ring diols with a relatively lower degree of stereoselectivity compared to benzo[a]pyrene (a five-ring PAH), but with a higher degree of stereoselectivity compared to phenanthrene (a three-ring PAH). The data of this study, together with those from our previous studies with phenanthrene, benzo[a]pyrene and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (a six-ring PAH), indicate that the regioselectivity in the metabolism of PAHs by brown bullhead and rainbow trout liver microsomes does not vary greatly with the size and shape of the molecule, whereas the degree of stereoselectivity in the metabolism of PAHs to benzo-ring dihydrodiols does.",

Trout as well as rat liver microsomes metabolized both CHR and 5-MeCHR at essentially similar rates, indicating that the methyl substituent does not alter the substrate specificity of the cytochrome P450(s) involved in the metabolism of the two PAHs. Dihydrodiols were the major CHR metabolites formed by both trout and rat liver microsomes, whereas the trout liver microsomes formed a considerably higher proportion of 5-MeCHR phenols compared to diols, indicating that 5-methyl substitution alters the substrate specificity of trout microsomal epoxide hydrolase for 5-MeCHR epoxides. Unlike trout liver microsomes, rat liver microsomes formed a much greater proportion of 5-MeCHR diols compared to 5-MeCHR phenols, suggesting that 5-MeCHR epoxides are better substrates for the microsomal epoxide hydrolase present in rat liver than for the enzyme in trout liver. Both trout and rat liver microsomes are more efficient at attacking the bay-region bond versus the non-bay-region double bond in chrysene. In contrast the reverse is true in the case of 5-MeCHR, indicating that a non-benzo ring methyl substituent alters the regioselectivity of the enzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism of PAHs.",

Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Chrysene is able to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) in cultured human lymphocytes. Probable human carcinogen. ANIMAL STUDIES: A single topical application of chrysene to neonatal rats at 1 mg/10 g body weight resulted in induction of skin and liver activity of enzymes. AHH activity was increased 251% in skin and 339% in liver; 7-ethoxycoumarin deethylase 133 and 208%, respectively. Among 20 female mice painted with 1% solution of chrysene, papillomas appeared in 9 animals and carcinomas in 8, the first tumor being observed after 8 months. There was an obvious shortening of the lifespan. Groups of 10 rats received repeated injections of 2-6 mg chrysene; four tumors were observed in treated animals, and sarcomas were found in controls. Several hydroxylated metabolites of chrysene were formed by rat liver microsomal cytochrome P450 activity, some of which had estrogenic activity. Chrysene has a \"bay-region\" in structure. It is metabolized by mixed function oxidases to reactive \"bay-region\" diol epoxides that are mutagenic in bacteria and tumorigenic in mouse skin painting assays and when injected into newborn mice. Mutagenicity tests were performed with chrysene in the Salmonella (TA98 and TA1535) microsome test, mice oocytes, bone-marrow cells and spermatogonia of Chinese hamsters. Using the Salmonella microsome test, no mutagenic activity was found when chrysene alone was tested. Chrysene, 450 mg/kg was given to Chinese hamsters by oral, gavage, or intraperitoneal administration and showed no mutagenic effects. In oocytes of mice, 8-12 weeks of age, a single application of 450 mg/kg chrysene resulted in a weak but significant chromosome aberration. In spermatogonia of Chinese hamsters a low but not significant increase in chromosomal aberrations, excluding gaps, was found. The chemical was positive in the Ames test with metabolic activation using strains TA100 and TA98. Chrysene may be phototoxic as well as photogenotoxic under UVB irradiation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Biotransformation and detoxification responses of mature scallop Chlamys farreri were studied during the reproduction period. Overall, females accumulated more chrysene than males, while males were more sensitive than females to chrysene exposure in gene expressions and enzyme activities.",

However, little information is available on its photogenotoxicity. The objective of the present study was to analyze the effects of chrysene, under environmental intensity of UVB (0.6 mW/sq cm) in human skin epidermal cell line (HaCaT). Kinetic of chrysene showed that the highest intracellular uptake of chrysene occurred after 24 hr of incubation. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased in a concentration dependent manner in chrysene treated cells under UVB irradiation. It was observed that UVB-irradiated chrysene induced apoptosis through activation of caspases-3 and phosphatidylserine translocation. Glutathione reduced (GSH) and catalase activity were decreased while apoptosis and DNA damage were induced significantly (p>0.01) as concentration of chrysene increased. Thus our results suggest that chrysene may be phototoxic as well as photogenotoxic under UVB irradiation.",

MIO-M1 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of chrysene with or without lipoic acid. Cell viability was measured by a trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Caspase-3/7 activity was measured by a fluorochrome assay. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was quantified by an LDH assay. The production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) was measured with a 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dye assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using the JC-1 assay. Intracellular ATP content was determined by the ATPLite kit. MIO-M1 cells showed significantly decreased cell viability, increased caspase-3/7 activity, LDH release at the highest chrysene concentration, elevated ROS/RNS levels, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential value, and decreased intracellular ATP content after exposure to 300, 500, and 1,000 uM chrysene compared with the control. Pretreatment with 80 uM lipoic acid reversed loss of cell viability in 500-uM-chrysene-treated cultures (24.7%, p<0.001). Similarly, pretreatment with 80 uM lipoic acid before chrysene resulted in decreased caspase-3/7 activities (75.7%, p<0.001), decreased ROS/RNS levels (80.02%, p<0.001), increased mitochondrial membrane potential values (86%, p<0.001), and increased ATP levels (40.5%, p<0.001) compared to 500-uM-chrysene-treated cultures. Chrysene, a component of cigarette smoke, can diminish cell viability in MIO-M1 cells in vitro by apoptosis at the lower concentrations of Chrysene (300 and 500 uM) and necrosis at the highest concentration. Moreover, mitochondrial function was particularly altered. However, lipoic acid can partially reverse the cytotoxic effect of chrysene. Lipoic acid administration may reduce or prevent Muller cell degeneration in retinal degenerative disorders.",

The mutagenicity of 0.05 nmol of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium is inhibited 50% by incubation of the bacteria and the diol epoxide with 150 nmol of ferulic acid, 75 nmol of caffeic acid, 50 nmol of chlorogenic acid or, most strikingly, 1 nmol of ellagic acid in the 0.5-ml incubation mixture. A 3-nmol dose of ellagic acid inhibits mutation induction by 90%. Ellagic acid is also a potent antagonist of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in Chinese hamster V79 cells. Mutations to 8-azaguanine resistance induced by 0.2 uM diol epoxide are reduced by 50% when tissue culture media also contains 2 uM ellagic acid. Similar to results obtained with the bacteria, ferulic, caffeic, and chlorogenic acids are approximately two orders of magnitude less active than ellagic acid in the mammalian cell assay. The antimutagenic effects of the plant phenols result from their direct interaction with B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2, because a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of diol epoxide disappearance in cell-free solutions of 1:9 dioxane/water, pH 7.0, is observed with all four phenols. In parallel with the mutagenicity studies, ellagic acid is 80-300 times more effective than the other phenols in accelerating the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2. Ellagic acid at 10 uM increases the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 by approximately 20-fold relative to the spontaneous and hydronium ion-catalyzed hydrolysis of the diol epoxide at pH 7.0. Ellagic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of the mutagenic activity of bay-region diol epoxides of benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, but higher concentrations of ellagic acid are needed to inhibit the mutagenic activity of the chemically less reactive bay-region diol epoxides of benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, and benzo[c]phenanthrene. These studies demonstrate that ellagic acid is a potent antagonist of the adverse biological effects of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolites of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and suggest that this naturally occurring plant phenol, normally ingested by humans, may inhibit the carcinogenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",

Among the widely distributed chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and preferentially 3,3,'4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their heterocyclic analogues such as benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[b]- and -[j]fluoranthene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]acridine, benzo[b]naphtho-[2,1-d]thiophene, and 5,6-benzoflavone were found to be potent inducers stimulating the formation of the proximate, and some of them also the ultimate carcinogen of chrysene. Lindane, carbaryl, DDT, and pentachlorophenol were found to be inefficient or weak inducers. With the exception of phenobarbital no inducers were found among the pharmaceuticals investigated. Sex-dependent metabolism was found for Wistar-rats. No 1,2-oxidation was observed in females, and turnover rates were lower than in males. ...in most cases the same effective xenobiotic induces the bay-region diolepoxide in both chrysene and benz[a]anthracene.",

We investigated the relationships between inhalation exposure to asphalt emissions and urinary biomarkers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in asphalt workers (AW, n=75) and in ground construction workers (CW, n=37). Total polyaromatic compounds (PAC) and 15 priority PAHs in inhaled air were measured by personal sampling. Hydroxylated PAH metabolites (OH-PAHs) (2-naphthol, 2-hydroxyfluorene, 3-hydroxyphenanthrene, 1-hydroxypyrene, 6-hydroxychrysene and 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene) were determined in urine spot samples collected in three different times during the work week. Median vapor-phase PAC (5.5 ug per cu m), PAHs (<or=50 ng m(-3)) and OH-PAHs (0.08-1.11 ug per L) were significantly higher in AW than in CW, except in the cases of air naphthalene and 2-naphthol. Airborne levels of particle-phase contaminants were similar in the two groups and much lower than vapor-phase levels; metabolites of particulate PAHs were never found in quantifiable amounts. An appreciable increase in OH-PAH levels during the work day and work week was found in AW; median levels for 2-hydroxyfluorene, 3-hydroxyphenanthrene and 1-hydroxypyrene were, respectively, 0.29, 0.08 and 0.18 at baseline; 0.50, 0.18 and 0.29, pre-shift; 1.11, 0.44 and 0.44 ug per L, post-shift. Each OH-PAH exhibited a characteristic profile of increase, reflecting differences in half-lives of the parent compounds. In non-smoking subjects, positive correlations were found between vapor-phase PAC or PAHs and OH-PAHs both in pre- and post-shift samples (0.34 <or= r<or=69). Smokers exhibited 2-5-fold higher OH-PAHs than non-smokers, at any time and at both workplaces. Our results suggest that OH-PAHs are useful biomarkers for monitoring exposure to asphalt emissions. The work-related exposure to PAC and PAHs was low in all AW, but urinary metabolites reflected exposure satisfactorily.",

Recently, chrysene has been implicated as an etiologic determinant of chemical carcinogenesis. Here we describe the ability of chrysene to induce AHH in cultured human lymphocytes. Lymphocytes were obtained from 9 healthy subjects, divided into 2 sets, and cultured in duplicate, triplicate, or quadruplicate for 48 h. Chrysene (25 uM final concentration) in acetone was then added to the induced culture set and the control set received acetone alone. Lymphocytes were then cultured an additional 24 hr before harvesting. AHH was quantitated by a fluorometric analysis of the phenolic metabolites produced by incubating the lymphocytes with B[a]P for 35 min. A significant increase in enzyme induction occurred in the chrysene-induced cultures compared with control (non-induced) cells (one-tailed student t-test; p<0.001). It was also observed that the interindividual variation in AHH inducibility seen with other PAHs is also observed with chrysene.",

Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) exhibit a wide geographic distribution throughout North America and have been suggested as a terrestrial biomonitoring species to facilitate comparisons between superfund sites. Chemicals tested were benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), pyrene (Pyr), and chrysene (Chr). Adult male deer mice were exposed via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection every other day for 11 d to the PAHs (0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) or a corn oil carrier control. Both BaP and Chr suppressed the plaque-forming cell (PFC) response at all treatment levels. Pyr exposure (1-30 mg/kg) also resulted in suppression of this response. Macrophage pinocytosis was suppressed only by Chr (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg). Concanavalin A-induced proliferation was stimulated by BaP at all dose levels, by Pyr at 1-30 mg/kg, and by Chr at 30 mg/kg. Chr did not affect pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced proliferation; however, BaP (1-30 mg/kg) and Pyr (0.3-30 mg/kg) produced stimulation of this response as compared to respective controls. BaP and Chr stimulated cytochrome P-450 1A1 (CYP1A1) activity (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) as measured by ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity, but Pyr did not. These results indicate that immune function endpoints appear to be more sensitive to these PAHs than measured hepatic CYP450 activity.",

For this purpose, a study was performed on juvenile scallops exposed to BaP (0.01, 0.2, and 4 ug/L), BbF (0.02, 0.2, and 2u g/L) and CHR (0.2, 0.8, and 3.2 ug/L) for 21 days. Accumulations of these three PAHs in soft parts of scallops, except the 0.01 ug/L BaP group and the 0.02 g/L BbF group, showed obvious time and dose dependence, and CHR accumulation was higher when compared to BaP and BbF. Oxidative damage indicators, including lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyl (PC) and DNA strand breaks, were also measured in soft parts to assess effects of the selected PAHs. The results showed that the LPO levels, PC contents and DNA damage were induced significantly (p<0.05 or p<0.01), except in the low level groups of BaP and BbF, and different trends were detected with time of exposure. According to the correlation analysis results, PC content in soft parts showed a good correlation with the target contaminant and seemed to be proposed as a potential early indicator of BaP, BbF and CHR. In addition the sequence of toxicity is BaP>BbF>CHR, judging by the level of induction of oxidative damage at 0.2 ug/L levels. The results of this research are expected to contribute to the establishment of a good biochemical index of exposure to PAHs in laboratory experiments, which can be further useful in field studies.",

In this study, juvenile white shrimp L. vannamei were exposed to CHR for 21 days at four different concentrations as 0, 0.3, 2.1 and 14.7 ug/L. Results showed that CHR bioaccumulation increased rapidly at first then reached a plateau. The activities of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH), 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), epoxide hydrolase (EH), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), sulfotransferase (SULT) and uridinediphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UGT) were induced and then became stable gradually. Moreover, 2.1 and 14.7 ug/L CHR treatments increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in gills and hepatopancreas, while total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and GSH/GSSG were suppressed after CHR exposure. Additionally, lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, protein carbonyl (PC) contents and DNA damage were induced throughout the exposure period, and different trends were detected with time of exposure. Overall, these novel findings of CHR bioaccumulation and resulted toxicity demonstrate that CHR could affect the physical status of L. vannamei. This study will form a solid basis for a realistic extrapolation scientific data for aquaculture water monitoring and food security.",

Scallops were exposed to 0.2, 0.8 and 3.2 ug/L CHR for 21 days; at day 10 scallops were induced to spawn. At days 1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 15 and 21, enzymatic activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST), related mRNA expression levels of CYP1A1, GST-pi and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in digestive glands and CHR bioaccumulation in tissues were examined by separately analyzing male and female scallops. During the pre-spawn period, CHR concentrations of the treated groups in tissues except the hemolymph increased rapidly. Levels of enzymatic activities and related gene expressions were all induced by the exposure to CHR for females and males. GST activity and GST-pi mRNA expression showed a good time- and dose-dependent relationship only in males, and P-gp mRNA expression exhibited a dose-dependent manner in both sexes. During the post-spawn period, spawning caused significant reductions of bioaccumulation in tissues but the gill and hemolymph. Enzymatic activities and related gene expressions were for females significantly depressed at day 21 at 0.8 or 3.2 ug/L CHR. Overall, females accumulated more CHR than males, while males were more sensitive than females to CHR exposure in gene expressions and enzyme activities. P-gp mRNA expression seemed to be a potential biomarker for PAH exposure. These results will offer the information on CHR biotransformation in this species, and ensure the influence of gender and reproductive status on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) detoxification metabolism.",

It has been identified in mainstream cigarette smoke; mainstream smoke of marijuana cigarettes; exhaust emissions from gasoline engines; with triphenylene in exhaust of burnt coals; gasolines; crude oils; charcoal-broiled steaks; broiled and smoked meat; smoked fish; vegetables; edible oils and fats; and roasted and soluble coffee. Chrysene's use in organic syntheses may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.23X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chrysene will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase chrysene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Chrysene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, chrysene is expected to have no mobility based upon log Koc values of 6.11-7.34. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.4X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Chrysene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Adsorption to soil is expected to inhibit biodegradation. Biodegradation half-lives of 371 and 387 days were observed for chrysene in Kidman and McLaurin sandy loam soils, respectively, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, chrysene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. In shake flask studies, an initial chrysene concentration of 2.7 ug/mL was reduced to 1.2 ug/mL following 2 weeks incubation in contaminated groundwater from t a US creosote superfund site, respectively, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated BCFs of 2408-6465 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. PAHs may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as some fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure may be through inhalation and dermal contact with chrysene at workplaces where coal and petroleum derived substances are produced or used or where combustion processes are extensive. The general population may be exposed to chrysene primarily through the smoking of tobacco, inhalation of polluted air and by ingestion of food and water contaminated by combustion effluents. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.4X10-7(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 6.23X10-9 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 0.002 mg/L(5). Chrysene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(6), estimated BCF of 2408-6465(SRC), from its log Kow of 5.63-6.28(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Marine organisms which lack a metabolic detoxification enzyme system, tend to accumulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(9). Half-lives for the direct photochemical decomposition of chrysene in freshwater were computed to be: 4.4 hours near the surface of freshwater (simulated latitude, 40 deg N, mid-day, mid-summer), 13 hours at a depth of 5 m, and 68 hours at a depth of 5 m and partitioned to bottom sediment(10). In shake flask studies, an initial chrysene concentration of 2.7 ug/mL was reduced to 1.2 ug/mL following 2 weeks incubation in contaminated groundwater from t a US creosote superfund site(11), suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

No significant degradation of chrysene was observed in soil obtained from a former tar-oil refinery following 8 weeks of incubation in a percolator(2). However, when sand was contaminated with soil extracts containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including chrysene, and inoculated with a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degrading mixed culture, the chrysene concentration was reduced from approx. 50 mg/kg soil to approx. 19 mg/kg soil(2). The inhibition of chrysene biodegradation was attributed to binding of chrysene with the soil(2). In a 240 day soil microcosm study, half-lives of 980, 1000, and 730 days at 10, 20, and 30 \u00b0C, respectively, were estimated for chrysene(3). In bench-scale biotreatability studies using a solid-phase bioremediation process (landfarming chambers containing sediment and soil collected from the American Creosote Works Superfund site, Pensacola, FL), the chrysene concentration was reduced from 114.0 to 53.4 mg/landfarming chamber in unamended surface soil; 114.0 to 46.2 mg/landfarming chamber in nutrient-amended surface soil; 1443.6 to 1146.6 mg/landfarming chamber in unamended sediment; and 1443.6 to 992.4 mg/landfarming chamber in nutrient-amended sediment following 12 weeks incubation(4). After 16 months incubation in biologically active soils containing 1-phenyldecane as a primary substrate, 84% of chrysene was recovered; 95% of chrysene was recovered from a poisoned control after 16 months incubation(5). Half-lives for chrysene ranged from 1000 days, using a synthetic mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons applied and incubated together in Kidman sandy loam soil, to 77 days in a mixture of oil refinery wastes applied to Kidman sandy loam soil(6). A half-life of 371 days was observed for chrysene when applied and incubated as a single constituent in Kidman sandy loam soil(6).",

Chrysene biodegraded 9% in a wastewater treatment plant(2). Chrysene was removed 90% over 36 days in an activated sludge pilot reactor and was attributed to biodegradation(3). Half-lives of 39.2 and 173.7 days were observed for chrysene in wood preserving sludge at an initial chrysene concentration of 2000 mg/kg and loading values of 86 and 172 g/kg, respectively(4). Chrysene, present at 150 ppm, was degraded approx 38 and 50% after 2 and 5 days, respectively, when incubated in liquid resting-cell experiments with a pre-grown polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degrading culture(5). Mineralization of (14)C-chrysene was 20.46 and 0.15% following 90 days incubation with microbial mats (consisting of a freshwater consortium of bacteria and cyanobacteria) in a series of dark and light flasks, respectively(6).

According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF value suggests that the potential of chrysene for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including chrysene, have been shown to be rapidly metabolized by some aquatic organisms(4). Bioaccumulation factors (concentration in muscle/concentration in sediments) ranging from 0.03 to 0.06 were measured in flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) following 4 months exposure to Hibernia crude oil in sediments(5). BCFs in clam (Macoma inquinata) were 694 and 0.04 after 7 days exposure to respective chrysene concentrations of 0.0004 and 8.37 ppm(6). A BCF of 8.2 was measured in clam (Rangia cuneata) exposed to chrysene water concentration of 0.066 ppm for 1 day(6). The BCF in lugworm (Abarenicola pacifica) was 1-6 using a sediment chrysene concentration of 0.2 ppm exposed for 58 days(6). The biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) for chrysene determined using oligochaete worm (Lumbriculus variegatus) was 0.42 and 0.11 in Lake Erie sediment from Vermilion, OH and Dunkirk, NY, respectively(7). Chrysene was detected at 4 and 11 ug/kg in the soft-body tissue of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) after 43 days incubation in the water of Pensacola Bay, FL(8). Clams (Macoma nasuta) exposed to field-contaminated sediments for 28 days contained chrysene at mean concentrations of 8.1-88 ng/g dry weight(9). A BCF of approx 2000 was measured in Daphnia magna, elimination of chrysene was rapid(10). Chrysene was not detected in polychaete (Nereis diversicolor) and gastropod (Hinia reticulata) exposed to sediment from three harbors in Norway, therefore, the BSAF of chrysene could not be calculated(11).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Chrysene was detected, not quantified, in suspended particulate matter samples collected in the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries at a frequency of 43, 61, 76 and 70% in Aug 1990, Oct 1990, April 1991 and May 1991, respectively(3). Chrysene was detected in water samples from the Mississippi River at 7, 12, and 10 ng/L for samples collected near the inflow of the Ohio River, 20 miles below Memphis, TN, and in New Orleans, LA, respectively(4). Chrysene was detected, not quantified, in water and suspended sediment samples from Fort Erie, Canada and Niagara-on-the-Lake between Dec 1984 and March 1986(5). Chrysene was detected in samples collected from the Otonabee River, Ontario, Canada in 1994 at 0.0503-0.2781 ug/mL(6). Chrysene was detected in surface water samples collected July 1963 from Main River at Seligenstradt, Germany at 38.2 ng/L(7). Chrysene/benzo(a)anthracene was detected in the Thames River at Kew Bridge, Albert Bridge and Tower Bridge at respective concentrations of 140, 270 and 530 ng/L(7). Water samples collected from Lake Manzala, located at the northeastern edge of the Nile Delta in Egypt, and three drains contained chrysene at 3.9-1600 ng/L(8). Chrysene was detected in both the Neris and Nemunas rivers, Lithuanian in samples collected Oct 2001(9). Water from the Seine Estuary (France) contained 10-34 ng/L of triphenylene/chrysene in samples collected Nov 2002 to Feb 2005(10). Chrysene was detected in surface water samples collected Oct 2010 from the Chinese cities of Wojin, Chanshu and Binhu at 0.1, 0.5 and 0.7 ng/L, respectively(11).",

Chrysene was detected in sewage sludge at <1-38 mg/kg (US), not detected to 60 mg/kg (Canada) and 1.32-4.6 mg/kg (Germany)(3). Sludge from the Muskegon County Wastewater Management Treatment System, MI was found to contain chrysene at 278 ug/kg(4). Average chrysene concentrations associated with the solid phase in raw sewage, primary effluent and secondary effluent from the Hamilton Woodward plant, a conventional activated sludge treatment facility, were 10.2, 8.9, and 1.1 ug/g, respectively(5). In the National Urban Runoff Program, chrysene was detected in 7% of the samples (86 samples from 19 cities); positive samples were from Lake Quinsigamond, MA, Washington, DC, Glen Ellyn, IL and Bellevue, WA and concentrations were 0.6-10 ppb(6). Samples of urban runoff collected in Madrid contained chrysene at a mean annual concentration of 1.4 ug/L(7). Chrysene was detected in farmland ditch water at a mean concentration of 0.10 ug/L and railway right-of-way ditch water at mean concentrations of 228 and 0.17 ug/L for ditches with and without utility poles, respectively(8). Chrysene was reported at 15-79, 1-16 and not detected to 7 ng/L in the raw wastewater, treated wastewater and streams of wastewater from treatment plants in Jordan, respectively(9). Chrysene was detected at 10.1-11.0 ng/L in two of 102 effluent samples collected in 2010 from 52 municipal wastewater treatment and water pollution control facilities in the state of Oregon(10). Chrysene was reported at 463.96-2958.66 ug/kg in sewage sludge from 6 waste water treatment plants in Beijing, China; multiple samples were collected Feb 2004 to May 2005(11). Waste water sludge samples collected from six plants along the Nakdong River in Korea contained chrysene at 0.029-3.39 mg/kg dry weight(12). The mean concentration of chrysene in sludge samples collected from 14 wastewater treatment plants in Bursa, Turkey during the summer of 2008 was 94.1-934.2 ug/kg dm(13). Chrysene was detected in 7 of 14 sampling points across a sewage treatment network in Maresme, Spain, at 0.03-2.89 ug/L(14). Chrysene was detected in the outlets of three storm sewers in particulate and total water concentrations of 0.19-1.8 ug/g dry weight and 17-655 ng/L, respectively; samples were collected Feb 2008 to March 2009 from Paris and its suburbs(15).",

Sediment samples taken from a discharge stream near a wood-preserving facility in Pensacola, FL in 1984 contained chrysene at an average concentration of 8500 ug/kg; sediment taken from Pensacola Bay was found to contain 100 ug/kg(2). Chrysene was detected, not quantified, in sediments from the Elizabeth River in Virginia(3). Chrysene was detected in sediments collected Nov 1983 to April 1984 from Eagle Harbor in Puget Sound and President Point, WA at 300-7800 and 140 ng/g dry weight, respectively(4). Sediment samples collected from Santa Monica Bay and Palos Verdes Shelf, CA in Sept 1985 contained mean chrysene concentrations of, ng/g dry weight (depth, cm): in the Bay 7.4 (0 to 2) and 5.9 (4 to 8); and in the Shelf 50 (0 to 2), 41 (8 to 12), 174 (0 to 2), and 249 (8 to 12)(5). Chrysene was detected in suspended sediment samples taken from Suisun Bay, Carquinez Strait, and Chipps Island (areas of San Francisco Bay, CA) in 1991 at average concentrations of 43.2, 7.8, and 13.5 ng/g, respectively(6). Sediment cores collected from 17 locations on the Washington continental shelf and slope contained chrysene at 1.8-2.1, 2.2-3.4, 0.6-1.4, 0.4-1.6 and 2.9 ug/g organic carbon; samples were from the inner shelf, midshelf, outer shelf, slope and Pleistocene gray clay, respectively(7). Bed sediments collected along a contamination gradient in the Lauritzen Canal, CA in 1993 contained chrysene at 110-1940 ng/g; the highest concentration occurring at the head of the canal(8). Bed and suspended sediment samples taken from Suisun Bay, CA contained chrysene at not detected to 106 and 56-151 ng/g dry weight, respectively(9).",

Chrysene was detected at not detected to 416.0 and 28.0-356.8 ug/kg dry weight in leaves of bay evergreen tree (Laurus nobilis) collected in Feb 1991 from nine sites in the city of Florence and six sites in the foothills surrounding Florence, Italy, respectively(2). Chrysene was detected at 53.2-287.2 ng/g in needles taken from Pinus silvestris in the vicinity of a chemical factory that processes crude tar and benzene in Czechoslovakia in Sept 1989(3). Chrysene was detected in pine needle samples collected throughout the UK in 1994 at 2.2-135 ng/g dry weight(4). Casuarina littorina (needles) and leaf litter collected near a roadside in Brisbane, Australia contained 96 and 103 ng/g wet weight chrysene, respectively(5). In April 2005, pine needle samples were collected from 35 sites across Liaoning, China; chrysene was detected at 6-203 ng/g dry weight(6). Chrysene was detected in pine needle samples from 27 locations scattered all over the Portuguese continental territory at 10.8-121.4 and 5.0-134.7 ng/g dry weight in 19 Pinus pinea and 12 Pinus pinaster samples, respectively; samples were collected in April 2007(7). Chrysene/benzo(a)anthracene was detected in foliage of carrots grown in sewage sludge amended soil at 3-8 ug/kg dry weight; the concn in the foliage of carrots grown in unamended soil was 7 ug/kg dry weight(8). Chrysene was detected in the roots and shoots of wheat (Triticum aestivum L) grown in 15 agricultural fields near Tianjin city, China at 0.12-2.08 and 0.10-1.88 ug/g dry weight, respectively(9). Chrysene was detected in phytoplankton/seston from Bohai Bay, north China at 25.68 ng/g dry weight in samples collected May, June and Sept 2002(10). Chrysene was detected in aquatic moss samples collected from the Danube and Traun rivers in Austria at 18-26 and 12 ug/kg dry weight, respectively(11). Chrysene was detected at 21-141 and 15-58 ng/g dry weight in moss species H. splendens and P. schreberi, respectively; samples were collected July 2005 from 10 locations in the southern part of the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland(12).

Chrysene was detected in cigarette mainstream and sidestream smoke at 28.0 and 66.7 ug/g, respectively(2). Chrysene was detected in side-stream cigarette smoke and wood smoke at mean concentrations of 1 and 9 ppm, respectively(3). Chrysene was reported as a constitute of cigarette smoke(4). Chrysene was detected in pig and cattle slurry taken from pits on farms located at Swiss Soil Monitoring Network sites at 4-44 and 3-33 ug/kg dry weight, respectively(5). Samples of compost from 3 different compost piles in Switzerland were found to contain chrysene at a range of 129-309 ug/kg dry weight with a mean of 243.0 ug/kg dry weight(5). Chrysene/triphenylene has been detected in combustion products from polyethylene(6). Chrysene was detected at 8.2 ug/10 g standard mineral oil(7). Chrysene was detected in 95% lead-free gasoline and premium leaded gasoline at a mean concentration of 0.03 and 0.01 mg/L, respectively(8). Chrysene was detected in coal tar film and bulk coal tar at 660 and 650 mg/kg, respectively(9). Chrysene was detected in oil collected from four Kuwait oil lakes in Sept 1992, concentration tended to increase with weathering time: initial concentrations were 5.74-114.6 mg/kg, after 21 months concentrations were 8.72-282.3 mg/kg(10). Chrysene was detected in solvent-refined coal heavy distillate, coal tar and carbon black at 3.6, 8.6 and 20 ug/g, respectively(11). The mean concentration of chrysene in two unused lubricating oils was 0.31 ppm; in used lubricating oils from gasoline, M15, diesel and gas fueled vehicles mean concentrations were 34, 48, 0.8, and 11 ppm, respectively(12).",

Wet and dry deposition of chrysene was reported at 4.3-53 and 1.6-8.0 ng/sq m/day, respectively; study was conducted on Mazzorbetto Island in the northern part of the Venetian lagoon, May to Nov 2005(2). Chrysene was detected in 75% of house hold dust samples collected Feb 29 to Apr 11, 2004 from 24 homes in Kuwait from detection limit to 501 ng/g dust(3). Chrysene was not detected in 30 dust samples taken from the kitchens that use wood, kerosene and butane gas cook systems(4). Chrysene was detected at 0.015-35.1 ug/g in vacuum cleaner dust samples collected Nov 2002 and Mar 2003 from 75 homes in Ottawa, ON, Canada(5). Chrysene was detected in surface road dusts collected in various locations throughout Birmingham, UK and Lahore, Pakistan at 11.4-5940 ug/kg(6).",

Occupational exposure may be through inhalation and dermal contact with chrysene at workplaces where coal and petroleum derived substances are produced or used or where combustion processes are extensive(2). Chrysene was detected in breathing zones of a plant producing carbon anodes for aluminum electrolysis at 0.18-10.02 ug/cu m(3). The mean chrysene concentration in the breathing zone of workers of a creosote impregnation plant was 0.11 ug/cu m; in a hall where switch elements were assembled was 0.05 ug/cu m; and 2.9 ug/cu m in air near manual metal-arc welding(4). Chrysene has been detected in occupational environments at the following airborne concentrations (geometric mean), ug/cu m: coke plant, 14.49; carbon anode plant, 1.403; graphite plant, 2.512; silicon carbide plant, 0.221; metal recycling plant, 0.071; and a bitumen paving plant, 0.109(5). Air samples collected above the doors of smoking kilns used in Danish smokehouses contained chrysene in the particulate phase at 0.03-78 ug/cu m(6). Chrysene was detected in the air of upper and lower floors of a Swedish alloy factory at an average of 400 and 260 ng/sample in samples collected Nov-Dec 2007 and at 700 and 600 ng/sample in samples collected Jan 2008(7). The general population may be exposed to chrysene primarily through the smoking of tobacco, inhalation of polluted air and by ingestion of food and water contaminated by combustion effluents(2).",

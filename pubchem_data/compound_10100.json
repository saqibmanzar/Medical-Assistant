This agent mimics the effects of the endogenous opiate dextropropoxyphene, by binding to mu receptors located throughout the central nervous system. The binding results in GTP to GDP exchanges on the mu-G-protein complex, by which effector adenylate cyclase is inactivated thereby decreasing intracellular cAMP. This, in turn, inhibits the release of various nociceptive neurotransmitters, such as substance P, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, vasopressin, and somatostatin. In addition, dextropropoxyphene closes N-type voltage-gated calcium channels and opens calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels. This results in hyperpolarization, thereby reducing neuronal excitability, which further decreases the perception of pain.",

The analgesic effect of propoxyphene is due to its d-isomer, dextropropoxyphene, which bind to opiate receptors, primarily the OP3 receptor located within the central nervous system (CNS). Mediated through G-protein coupled OP3 receptors and cAMP signaling, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is inhibited. Propoxyphene also inhibits the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon and close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels. This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

FDA has requested that companies voluntarily withdraw propoxyphene from the United States market.  Propoxyphene is an opioid pain reliever used to treat mild to moderate pain. It is sold under various names as a single-ingredient product (e.g., Darvon) and as part of a combination product with acetaminophen (e.g., Darvocet).  FDA's recommendation is based on all available data including data from a new study that evaluated the effects that increasing doses of propoxyphene have on the heart. The results of the new study showed that when propoxyphene was taken at therapeutic doses, there were significant changes to the electrical activity of the heart: prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex and prolonged QT interval. These changes, which can be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG), can increase the risk for serious abnormal heart rhythms. FDA has concluded that the safety risks of propoxyphene outweigh its benefits for pain relief at recommended doses. ... Additional Information for Healthcare Professionals: FDA recommends that healthcare professionals:  Stop prescribing and dispensing propoxyphene-containing products to patients. Contact patients currently taking propoxyphene-containing products and ask them to discontinue the drug. Inform patients of the risks associated with propoxyphene. Discuss alternative pain management strategies other than propoxyphene with your patients. Be aware of the possible risk of cardiac conduction abnormalities (prolonged QT, PR, and QRS intervals) in patients taking propoxyphene and assess patients for these events if they present with any signs or symptoms of arrhythmia. Report any side effects with propoxyphene to FDA's MedWatch program.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Norpropoxyphene and unchanged propoxyphene are excreted mainly in urine. Approximately 20-25% of an orally administered 65-mg dose of propoxyphene hydrochloride may be recovered in urine as unchanged drug (trace amount) and free or conjugated norpropoxyphene within 48 hours.It appears that the unchanged drug is excreted mainly within 6 hours and the metabolite is excreted in the 6- to 48-hour period following administration.

The aim of this study was to investigate the respective part of each of these two organs in the metabolism of the analgesic d-propoxyphene. Pharmacological doses of d-propoxyphene were given in the duodenum (ID), the portal vein (IP), and the femoral vein (IV) of male Wistar rats. A tracer dose of (14)C-d-propoxyphene was also administered either in IV, IP, or ID as well as in hepatectomized rats or rats with bile duct diversion. In vitro demethylation occurring in liver and intestinal microsomes was also studied. Absolute DP bioavailability obtained after oral administration was two times higher than that observed after portal administration (48.9% vs. 23.2%, respectively), an result opposite (i.e. a lower bioavailability) of that expected on the basis of the existence of a liver enzyme saturation phenomenon. The (14)C-d-propoxyphene cumulative excretion after (14)C-d-propoxyphene administration was significantly lower after IV or ID administration than after injection in the portal vein as a bolus or within 20 min. The biliary excretion of the labeled compound varied in the opposite direction, being greater after IV or ID than after IP administration, suggesting that the metabolism of d-propoxyphene in the liver is influenced by an extrahepatic transformation. This most likely occurs in the gut since the production of (14)C-d-propoxyphene after IV administration was similar to that after ID administration. This transformation did not prohibit d-propoxyphene detection in the systemic blood but was sufficient to increase the part eliminated with bile and to decrease the part demethylated NP. Demethylation mainly occurs in the liver since the production of (14)C-d-propoxyphene was nearly abolished in hepatectomized rats. Furthermore, microsomes of hepatic but not of intestinal origin were able to demethylate d-propoxyphene. Our data suggest that the transformation of d-propoxyphene occurring in gut after oral administration is responsible for changes in the hepatic metabolism of the drug.",

Propoxyphene primarily affects OP3 receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids such as propoxyphene also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.",

Concomitant use of propoxyphene and other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can result in potentially serious adverse effects, including death. Because respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result if CNS depressants are taken in combination with usual dosages of propoxyphene, the dosage of one or both agents should be reduced in patients who require such combined therapy. Patients receiving propoxyphene should be advised not to consume alcohol (including alcohol-containing prescription and nonprescription drugs) concomitantly.",

Propoxyphene concentrations were appreciably higher and norpropoxyphene concentrations were much lower in the patients than in the normal subjects. The ratio of areas under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hr, norpropoxyphene: propoxyphene, was 0.70 +/- 0.46 (x +/SD) in patients and 3.94 +/ 0.83 in normal subjects. A similar decrease in this ratio was observed previously in otherwise healthy dogs after surgical construction of portacaval shunt when propoxyphene was given orally, but not after intravenous injection of the drug. A woman with portacaval shunt and essentially complete renal failure was also studied; she exhibited the highest propoxyphene peak concentration in this investigation and had no detectable norpropoxyphene in plasma. Most of the patients, unlike the normal subjects, experienced considerable sedation after propoxyphene. These results are probably due to increase systemic availability of orally administered propoxyphene in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and possibly to increased receptor response to the drug by these patients. It is concluded that propoxyphene should be administered cautiously and in reduced doses to patients with hepatic dysfunction.",

On November 19, 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that it intends to withdraw propoxyphene from the US market, because new data indicate this drug may cause serious toxicity to the heart, even when used at therapeutic doses. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.0X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates (d)-propoxyphene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase (d)-propoxyphene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.4 hours. Particulate-phase (d)-propoxyphene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. (d)-Propoxyphene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, (d)-propoxyphene is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8.1X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. (d)-Propoxyphene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. (d)-Propoxyphene was classified as non-biodegradable in sewage treatment, indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, (d)-propoxyphene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 260 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 4 years and 160 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively, indicate that hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental process. Occupational exposure to (d)-propoxyphene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where (d)-propoxyphene is produced or used. Exposure to (d)-propoxyphene via ingestion will occur when administered drugs containing this compound; it is a substance of abuse. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to (d)-propoxyphene at well below the therapeutic dose via ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase (d)-propoxyphene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.4 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 9.9X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase (d)-propoxyphene may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC).(d)-Propoxyphene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4), and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Concentrations of P and NP in breast milk and plasma were quantitated by an HPLC method. Plasma P half-lives in mothers averaged 4.40 hr. P and NP breast milk concentrations generally followed plasma levels. NP/P averaged 2.69 in plasma and 2.73 in breast milk. While there was substantial inter- and intrasubject variability, the ratio of drug in the milk and plasma averaged 0.417 and 0.382 for P and NP. These similarities in distribution in breast milk were also reflected in elimination. Clearances of P and NP in milk were of the same order (3.97 mL/hr) as were elimination half-lives in milk in most subjects (mean = 3.68 hr for P and 5.49 hr for NP). Approximately twice as much NP was excreted in the milk, primarily because of the higher NP levels in plasma. Clearance of P and NP in breast milk also correlated strongly with breast milk volume. While little information is available concerning P and NP disposition in neonates, dosage estimates based on kinetic and pharmacologic assumptions suggest that the estimated amounts consumed by the neonate after the mother is given the recommended dose of the drug are not likely to result in toxic plasma levels.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

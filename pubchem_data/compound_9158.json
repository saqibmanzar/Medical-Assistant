ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This has been proven by recording the benz[a]anthracene metabolite profile in the rat liver by means of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) technique. Even a total dose of 3 times 50 micrograms/kg body wt increases the metabolism of benz[a]anthracene by a factor of 2. The formation of the 8,9- as well as the 5,6-dihydrodiol is stimulated to about the same extent, whereas the formation of the 10,11-dihydrodiol is suppressed. After comparatively low doses of the inducer, a metabolite is formed which corresponds in all parameters with the postulated ultimate carcinogen 3,4-dihydroxy-1,2-epoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracene. This metabolite and a number of other primary and secondary oxidation products could be identified after incubation with induced but not with normal microsomes. Therefore, it should be emphasised that metabolite profiles have to be recorded instead of measuring brutto conversions of PAH substrates to evaluate inducing effects.",

Six bands of metabolites of benzo(j)fluoranthene were separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and each band was tested for mutagenicity toward S. typhimurium TA 100 with activation. The major mutagenic band contained two dihydrodiols, one of which was identified as 9,10-dihydro-9, 10-dihydroxybenzo(j)fluoranthene by comparison to a synthetic reference standard. 9,10-Dihydro-9,10-dihydroxybenzo(j)fluoranthene was mutagenic toward S. typhimurium TA 100 with activation, presumably as a result of conversion to the corresponding dihydrodiol-epoxide. The major dihydrodiol metabolite of benzo(k)fluoranthene was identified, by comparison to a synthetic standard, as 8,9-dihydro-8,9-dihydroxybenzo(k)fluoranthene. This dihydrodiol, which could also be converted to a dihydrodiol-epoxide, was mutagenic toward S. typhimurium TA 100 with activation. The results of this study indicate that metabolism to dihydrodiols is one pathway in the activation of benzo(j)fluoranthene and benzo(k)fluoranthene to ultimate mutagens for S. typhimurium TA 100.",

The major metabolites of B[k]F formed in vitro using rat liver S-9 metabolism systems were 8,9-dihydro-8,9-dihydroxyB[k]F, the 2,3-quinone of B[k]F and 3-, 8- and 9-hydroxyB[k]F. Fluorine substitution within the structure of B[k]F substantially altered the types of metabolites formed in vitro. The most pronounced effect was observed with 9-fluoroB[k]F. In contrast to B[k]F, the 8,9-dihydro-8,9-dihydroxy-, 9-hydroxy- and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy derivatives were not detected as metabolites of 9-fluoroB[k]F. However, either the 2,3- or 4,5-dihydrodiol of 9-fluoroB[k]F was detected. In the case of 8-fluoroB[k]F, neither the 8- nor 11-hydroxy- derivatives were detected. The principle dihydrodiols formed from 8-fluoroB[k]F were the 10,11-dihydrodiol and either the 2,3-or 4,5-dihydrodiol. The pattern of metabolites formed with 3-fluoroB[k]F was similar to that observed with B[k]F with the exception that neither the 3- nor 4-hydroxy derivatives were formed. Mass spectral data indicated that fluoro substitution is not lost to any appreciable extent during the metabolism of 3-, 8- and 9-fluoroB[k]F. The mutagenic activity of these B[k]F fluoro derivatives along with B[k]F, 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxyB[k]F, the 2,3-quinone of B[k]F and 8,9-dihydro-8,9-dihydroxyB[k]F were evaluated in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 in the presence of rat liver S-9 metabolism systems. 3-FluoroB[k]F was more mutagenic than B[k]F, while both 8- and 9-fluoroB[k]F were less active. While the 2,3-dihydrodiol and 2,3-quinone were weakly active, the 8,9-dihydrodiol had similar mutagenic potency to B[k]F.",

Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar.

However, in activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a respirator and protective suit (preferably one piece, disposable, closely fitting at the ankles and wrists), including gloves, hair covering, and overshoes. Smoking, eating, and drinking should be prohibited in benzo(k)fluoranthene work areas. Transport of this substance should be in a securely sealed container which is placed in a second unbreakable, leakproof container.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

                                "Description": "In general, the occupational exposure limit (OEL) indicates the level of admissible exposure, for a length of time (usually 8 hours), to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health of a worker. The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Benzo(k)fluoranthene occurs ubiquitously as a product of incomplete combustion. It also occurs in fossil fuels. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. In human breast cancer cells, exposure to 0.1 to 1 uM B(k)F induced CYP1A1/1B1-catalyzed 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)) metabolism, whereas B(k)F levels greater than 1 uM inhibited E(2) metabolism. ANIMAL STUDIES: Intraperitoneal injection of 2.1 umol benzo[k]fluoranthene into newborn mice induced lung adenomas in 6.3% and 16.7% of males and females, respectively, and liver hepatomas and adenomas in 18.8% of males. Benzo(k)fluoranthene produced tumors after lung implantation in mice and when administered with a promoting agent in skin painting bioassays. Intrapulmonary injection of benzo[k]fluoranthene caused lung cancer (squamous-cell carcinoma) in female rats, and subcutaneous injection of benzo[k]fluoranthene caused cancer at the injection site (sarcoma) in mice of both sexes. Benzo(k)fluoranthene was reported to induce mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 (his-/his+) at a concentration of 10 ug/plate and in strain TA98 at a concentration of 5 ug/plate in the presence of an exogenous metabolic system. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Benzo(k)fluoranthene was not phototoxic and presented no toxicity for the three organisms tested up to 300 mg/kg, concentration rarely found in the environment (tested in Daphnia magna, Hyalella azteca, and Chironomus riparius).",

These enzymes metabolize PAH's into their toxic intermediates.

Supplementation of the exposure media with 0.45% dimethyl sulfoxide and 50 ppm of Tween 20 could guarantee the solubilization and stabilization of the PAHs up to 24 hr without affecting the embryos development. The exposure effects were tested by detecting the differential expression of a number of genes related to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor gene battery. Effects were detectable already after 6 hr of exposure. After 24 hr of exposure, all PAHs, except for benzo[a]anthracene, acted as potent inducers of the gene cyp1a1. Benzo[k]fluoranthene was the major inducer; the effect caused by the mixture at the lower concentration tested (1 ng/mL) was dominated by its presence. However, in the mixture at the highest concentration tested (10 ng/mL) it caused less induction and was not dominant. No significant bioaccumulation values were detected on embryos exposed to the PAHs tested in this study; however, the results obtained, indicated that PAHs undergo a very rapid metabolization inside the embryos, and that those biotransformation products yield changes on the expression of genes involved in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway. Future work should focus on identification of the PAH metabolization products and on the effect of these metabolites on toxicity.",

To this end, various biomarkers in the fish [7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD); superoxide dismutase (SOD); malondialdehyde (MDA) and metallothioneins (MT)] were measured after 96 h of exposure. When compared to either treatment with Pb and Zn mixtures or BkF-only treatment, the treatment with BkF combined with Pb and Zn resulted in lower responses of EROD and MT synthesis activity, and higher SOD and MDA increases. These results indicated that the co-exposure of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may cause more severe oxidative stress on fish. However, the effect of these interactions on EROD and MT may lead to an underestimation of the actual exposure in the field and thereby should be carefully considered.",

However, the toxicity of combined exposure to PAHs and phytoestrogen is not well investigated. In the present study, benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and benzo(k)fluorathene (B(k)F), genistein, along with 17 beta-estradiol (E2), were investigated for their single and combined developmental toxicity using zebrafish embryos as model system. We demonstrated that two representative PAHs, both B(a)P (>/= 1 uM) and B(k)F (>/= 10 uM), can cause significant malformation and mortality in developing zebrafish embryos. The toxicity effect of B(a)P was in general higher than that of B(k)F. Developmental exposure to high level of genistein (> 20 uM) or E2 (> 10 uM), also caused significant malformation and mortality in zebrafish larvae at 120 hours post fertilization (hpf). However, different toxic effects were observed for the combined exposure to PAHs and phytoestrogen in zebrafish. Lower doses of genistein (1 and 10 uM) and E2 (0.1 and 1 uM), when used in combination with high concentration of B(a)P (1 uM) or B(k)F (20 uM), can significantly suppress the toxicity effect of B(a)P and B(k)F in developing zebrafish embryos. The beneficial effect of genistein may be due to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes via directly interacting with aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, or disturbing the AhR pathway through interacting with estrogen receptor pathway.",

After 43 days of exposure (overall dose of 1325 ug/plant), celery plants retained only 1.4% of the total dose of ANT and 17.5% of the total dose of BkF. After exposure to a combination of ANT and BkF (1325 ug of each compound per plant), the average ANT concentrations were more than twofold higher in/on leaf blades, whereas BkF levels were insignificantly higher. Under natural photoperiod conditions equivalent to a normal day, the combined application of ANT and BkF to the above-ground parts of celery plants slowed down physicochemical transformations of ANT. A similar effect was observed when PAHs were applied to glass surfaces. The combination of both PAHs probably led to stacking interactions, which decreased volatilization, in particular of ANT. Phytotoxicity of ANT and BkF could not be unambiguously established based on the results of this study. In all analyzed treatments, the chlorophyll content of leaf blades remained unchanged. Foliar application of ANT reduced ascorbic acid levels in all analyzed plant parts and increased the total acidity of celery leaves. In all experimental treatments, the total phenolic content of leaves increased up to 15%. Interestingly, ANT and BkF did not produce cumulative effects when applied in combination (when total PAH concentrations per plant were twofold higher).",

Previously, we established an in vitro assay for TPO activity based on human recombinant TPO (hrTPO) stably transfected into human follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC-238) cells. It is important to determine whether environmental chemicals can disrupt TPO activity because it is an important factor in the TH axis. In this study, we used our assay to examine the changes in TPO activity in response to various chemicals, including benzophenones (BPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Overall, BPs, PAHs, and POPs slightly altered TPO activity at low doses, as compared with the positive controls methimazole (MMI), genistein, and 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxy BP. Benzophenone, benzhydrol, 3-methylchloranthracene, pyrene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(e)pyrene, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and heptachlor decreased TPO activity, while 2,4-dihydroxy BP, 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxy BP, and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene increased TPO activity. From these data, we can predict the disruption of TPO activity by various chemicals as a sensitive TH end point. TPO activity should be considered when enacting measures to regulate environmental exposure to thyroid-disrupting chemicals.",

Genotoxic effects were determined using DNA adduct analysis or analysis of expression of selected AhR-related genes involved in bioactivation of PAHs (CYP1A1, CYP1B1) and transcriptional repression (TIPARP). Sampled localities differing in the extent and source of air pollution did not exhibit substantially different genotoxicity. DNA adduct levels induced by three subtoxic EOM concentrations were relatively low (1-5 adducts/10(8) nucleotides), compared to levels induced by similar concentrations of B[a]P, while B[k]F gave very low DNA adduct levels. Here, we compared genotoxicity and gene deregulation induced by complex mixtures containing PAHs with the effects of the comparable concentrations of individual PAHs. Our results suggested inhibition of formation of B[a]P-induced DNA adducts compared to individual B[a]P, probably attributable to competitive inhibition by other non-genotoxic EOM components. In contrast, induction of AhR target genes appeared not to be antagonized by the components of complex mixtures, as induction of CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and TIPARP transcripts reached maximum levels induced by PAHs."

In this study, we evaluated how particulate PAHs modulated the formation of DNA damage induced by carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). Single strand breaks and alkali labile sites, as well as BPDE-N2-dGuo DNA adducts were measured in the competent HepG2 cells by Comet assay and HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. B[a]P, alone or in binary mixture with other PAHs (1 uM each), led to low amounts of strand breaks. In contrast, formation of BPDE-N2-dGuo adducts was significant and found to be enhanced in HepG2 co-treated for 14 hr by B[a]P in the presence of either benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F), dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DB[a,h]A) or indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IP). Opposite results were obtained with benzo[k]fluoranthene (B[k]F). The same observations were made when cells were pre-incubated with PAH before incubation with B[a]P. These results show that the interactions between PAHs are not direct competition reactions. Emphasis was then placed on the modulation of B[a]P-induced DNA damage by B[b]F and B[k]F. No difference in the time-course formation of DNA damage was observed. However, dose-response relationship differed between these two PAHs with a concentration-dependent inhibition of BPDE-N2-dGuo DNA by B[k]F whereas a constant level of potentiation for B[b]F was observed for concentrations higher than 1 uM. Altogether, these results show that the genotoxicity of B[a]P in binary mixtures with other carcinogenic PAH may be modulated. In such cases, a potentiation of BPDE-N2-dGuo adduct formation is most often observed with exception of B[k]F. Several biological mechanisms may account for these observations, including binding of PAHs to the Ah receptor (AhR), their affinity toward CYP450 and competition for metabolism. These different interactions have to be considered when addressing the intricate issue of the toxicity of mixtures.",

Data in the present paper demonstrate that BkF both increases and inhibits the catabolism of E2 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and that the in vitro BkF increase and inhibition are dependent on the concentration of BkF and the length of the incubation period. A radiometric assay was used to investigate the catabolism of [(3)H]E2 after exposure to 5 concentrations of BkF for 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 hr. The concentration of BkF necessary for maximal increase in catabolism of E2 varied with the incubation period. At 6 hr, a maximal increase was obtained with 0.01 and 0.1 uM, and at 48 hr a maximal increase was obtained with 0.5 uM and 1 uM BkF. The increased rate of E2 catabolism was transient at lower concentrations of BkF but remained maximal at 72 hr with 0.5 and 1 uM BkF. The highest concentration of BkF tested, 5 uM, was inhibitory at all time points. In contrast to BkF, fluoranthene (FL), another PAH frequently detected in environmental samples, did not significantly increase the catabolism of E2 at any of the concentrations or time points tested. Results showing that BkF inhibits the catabolism of E2 induced by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) suggest that the BkF inhibition of cellular E2 catabolism is due to competition between BkF and E2 for the TCDD-induced enzymes. Overall, results from these studies demonstrate that BkF both increases and inhibits the cellular catabolism of E2, and emphasize the importance of considering time as well as concentration when conducting short-term in vitro assays.",

A complex adduct pattern was detected in liver and intestine of exposed fish. For the time-course studies fish were exposed either by oral administration or by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Following a single i.p. injection of the mixture (40 umole/kg body weight of each substance) significantly elevated DNA adduct levels were detected in the liver after 1 day. Adduct levels were higher in liver than in intestine, in which significant elevation were detected from day 3 to 12. Following exposure via food (80 umole/kg body weight of each substance), adduct levels were detected in both liver and intestine 1 day after exposure, and continued to increase until day 3 in liver and day 6 in intestine. Calculation of a binding index, which compensates for differences in dosage, resulted in much higher adduct formation (five times in liver and 22 times in intestine) following oral exposure. Pikes receiving single oral doses of 12.5, 50, 100 or 200 umole/kg body weight of each substance exhibited significantly higher adduct levels in both liver and intestine compared to controls. Hepatic adduct levels were also higher in fish given 100 and 200 umole/kg compared to 12.5 umole/kg. Results from this study show that DNA adducts are rapidly formed in juvenile northern pike following both i.p. injection and feeding of a mixture of BaP, BkF and DBC. A maximum level was reached within a few days, which then persisted at approximately the same level for at least 9-12 days. The results also shows that higher levels of adducts were obtained following oral administration compared to i.p. injection, particularly in the intestine.",

No effects were noted on 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in digestive gland at low concentrations (0.5 and 1 ug/L) of BkF, but BkF increased the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity. At 10 ug/L BkF increased EROD activity significantly, and depressed GST activity. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in digestive gland increased significantly in 0.5 and 1 ug/L BkF. In 10 ug/L concentrations of BkF, the activity of three antioxidant enzymes increased first and reached a peak after a few days, before tapering off towards the end of the 30 day exposure. In high concentrations of BkF, activity of three antioxidant enzymes in gill showed an early peak (12 hr), before dropping off. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels increased along with sampling times, and there were time- and concentration-effects between LPO levels and BkF. The responses of the gills and the digestive gland were not always parallel which can be explained by differences in the bioavailability of the toxicant. The performance of each biomarker is assessed in the context of the role and advantages of selecting a battery of biomarkers for detecting contamination problems. The use of C. ferrari as a sentinel species for biomonitoring potential toxic effects in situ is discussed as well as mechanisms of BKF toxicity and alexipharmic strategies of C. ferrari.",

Sediment quality criteria often use toxicity data for individual PAHs. However, PAHs always occur in field sediments as a complex mixture of compounds. In this study, the toxicity of phenanthrene (P), fluoranthene (FLA) and benzo(k)-fluoranthene (B), alone or in combination, was assessed using monospecific sediment tests of acute toxicity (between 24 hr and 14 days). The test sediments were spiked formulated sediments. Toxicity of PAHs was determined on a freshwater pelagic organism, Daphnia magna, on an epibenthic organism, Hyalella azteca, and on a benthic organism, Chironomus riparius. The phototoxicity of fluoranthene and phenanthrene was verified. Benzo(k)fluoranthene was not phototoxic and presented no toxicity for the three organisms tested up to 300 mg/kg, concentration rarely found in the environment. For all PAHs, the toxicity towards Daphnia magna was two-fold higher in the sediment toxicity tests than in the water-only standard tests, probably due to suspended contaminated particles and contact of daphnids with sediment. For phenanthrene, the LC50s found were 50, 15 and 20 mg/kg dry weight sediment, respectively for Daphnia magna, Hyalella azteca and Chironomus riparius. The bioassays on fluoranthene yielded LC50s of 10, 5 and 15 mg/kg dw respectively for Daphnia magna, Hyalella azteca and Chironomus riparius. LC50s of the PAHs mixture (1/3 of each compound by weight) were around 10 mg/kg dry weight sediment for Hyalella azteca and 20 mg/kg for Chironomus riparius. The effects of PAHs in the mixture seemed to be synergistic. This study gives new data about PAH toxicity and showed that the additivity of PAH effects could be inadequate to assess the environmental risk.",

After 43 days of exposure (overall dose of 1325 ug/plant), celery plants retained only 1.4% of the total dose of ANT and 17.5% of the total dose of BkF. After exposure to a combination of ANT and BkF (1325 ug of each compound per plant), the average ANT concentrations were more than twofold higher in/on leaf blades, whereas BkF levels were insignificantly higher. Under natural photoperiod conditions equivalent to a normal day, the combined application of ANT and BkF to the above-ground parts of celery plants slowed down physicochemical transformations of ANT. A similar effect was observed when PAHs were applied to glass surfaces. The combination of both PAHs probably led to stacking interactions, which decreased volatilization, in particular of ANT. Phytotoxicity of ANT and BkF could not be unambiguously established based on the results of this study. In all analyzed treatments, the chlorophyll content of leaf blades remained unchanged. Foliar application of ANT reduced ascorbic acid levels in all analyzed plant parts and increased the total acidity of celery leaves. In all experimental treatments, the total phenolic content of leaves increased up to 15%. Interestingly, ANT and BkF did not produce cumulative effects when applied in combination (when total PAH concentrations per plant were twofold higher).",

It is found as a constituent of cigarette smoke and as a metabolic product in algae. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.65X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzo(k)fluoranthene will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase benzo(k)fluoranthene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benzo(k)fluoranthene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzo(k)fluoranthene is expected to have no mobility based upon a log Koc range of 6.81-7.91. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.84X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Benzo(k)fluoranthene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Soil half-lives for benzo(k)fluoranthene range from 65 to 1400 days. If released into water, benzo(k)fluoranthene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the log Koc values. The benzo(b,k)fluoranthene concentration was reduced to 1.7 ug/mL from an initial concentration of 2.9 ug/mL following 2 weeks incubation in contaminated groundwater; the final concentration in a sterile control was 2.8 ug/mL, indicating biodegradation had occurred. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated BCFs of 3415-6465 suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure may be through inhalation and dermal contact with benzo(k)fluoranthene at workplaces where coal and petroleum derived substances are produced or used or where combustion processes are extensive. The general population may be exposed to benzo(k)fluoranthene primarily through the smoking of tobacco, inhalation of polluted air and by ingestion of food and water contaminated by combustion effluents.

Benzo(k)fluoranthene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF range of 3415-6465(SRC), from a log Kow range of 5.86-6.28(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Marine organisms which lack a metabolic detoxification enzyme system, tend to accumulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(8). The benzo(b,k)fluoranthene concentration was reduced to 1.7 ug/mL from an initial concentration of 2.9 ug/mL following 2 weeks incubation in contaminated groundwater; the final concentration in a sterile control was 2.8 ug/mL, indicating biodegradation had occurred(9).",

After a 360-day inactive period with no further sludge applications, 29.2% of the total benzo(k)fluoranthene applied during the experiment remained; losses were viewed as resulting from a combination of biodegradation and undefined abiotic mechanisms(1). Average first-order degradation constants of 0.003/day and 0.003 to 0.005/day were measured for benzo(k)fluoranthene in batch reactor studies using uncontaminated Kidman sandy loam and Nunn clay loam, respectively, mixed with petroleum refinery wastes. These correspond to half-lives of 230 days in Kidman sandy loam and 140 to 230 days in Nunn clay loam. Average first-order benzo(k)fluoranthene degradation rates of 0.004-0.0107/day and 0.0025 to 0.0041/day were measured in soil column studies using uncontaminated Kidman sandy loam and Nunn clay loam, respectively, mixed with petroleum refinery wastes(2). These correspond to half-lives ranging from 65 to 170 days in Kidman sandy loam and 170 to 280 days in Nunn clay loam(3). In a 240 day soil microcosm study using Kidman sandy loam, half-lives of 910, 1400, and 910 days at 10, 20, and 30 \u00b0C, respectively, were estimated for benzo(k)fluoranthene(3). In a long-term study in which polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminated sludge was applied to agricultural soils in England, mean half-lives for benzo(k)fluoranthene were calculated to be 8.7 and 2.9 years; biodegradation was suspected to be the most important loss process in these soils(4). In soil microcosms, half-lives of 350, 143, 351, and 359 days were determined for benzo(k)fluoranthene using a sludge-amended rural agricultural soil with no previous sludge application, a sludge-amended rural agricultural soil, a sludge-amended rural coniferous forest soil, and a sludge-amended roadside soil, respectively(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Concentrations of dissolved benzo(k)fluoranthene in water samples collected from various sites in Port Phillip Bay, Australia in May and August 1986 were 0.003-0.013, 0.015-0.016 and 0.007-0.010 ng/L in water with no direct source of hydrocarbons, areas where the main sources of hydrocarbons is urban drainage and sites close to the discharge of a major oil refinery(3). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in 2 of 38 samples collected the winter of 1989-1990 from lakes and rivers in Alessandria, Italy at 2-5 ng/L(4). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in suspended sediment from the Mackenzie River, Canada at 0.019-0.12 ug/g(5). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in both the Neris and Nemunas rivers, Lithuanian in samples collected Oct 2001(6). Water from the Seine Estuary (France) contained 18-70 ng/L of benzo(b,k)fluoranthene in samples collected Nov 2002 to Feb 2005(7). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was not detected in surface water samples collected Oct 2010 from the Chinese cities of Wojin or Chanshu; it was detected at 0.5 ng/L in surface water from Binhu(8).",

Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in sewage sludge at a mean of 0.48 mg/kg dry weight(2). Combined isomers of benzo(b,j,k)fluoranthene were found in sediments from the effluent channel from a coking plant in an unspecified location at 23 ug/g dry weight(3). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in sewage sludge at 0.06-4.57 mg/kg (UK), <1.7 mg/kg (US) and 0.36-0.67 mg/kg (Germany)(4). Effluent from Norwegian sewage treatment plants contained <3 ng/L benzo(j,k)fluoranthene(5). In the National Urban Runoff Program, benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in 2% of the samples (86 samples from 19 cities); 4-10 ppb was detected in runoff at Lake Quinsigamond, MA and Bellevue, WA(6). Average benzo(k)fluoranthene concentrations associated with the solid phase in raw sewage, primary effluent and secondary effluent from the Hamilton Woodward plant, a conventional activated sludge treatment facility, were 7.8, 4.5 and 0.4 ug/g, respectively(7). Mean effluent and influent benzo(k)fluoranthene concentrations were <0.010-0.015 and <0.10-0.29 ug/L, respectively in six municipal waste water treatment plants in the Netherlands(8). Benzo(j,k)fluoranthene was detected in scrubber waste water from an aluminum smelters in Lista, Norway in 1991 at 600 ng/L(9). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was reported at not detected to 317 ng/L in the raw wastewater, treated wastewater and streams of wastewater from treatment plants in Jordan(10). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was reported at 115.07-2138.07 ug/kg in sewage sludge from 6 waste water treatment plants in Beijing, China; multiple samples were collected Feb 2004 to May 2005(11). At 14 sampling points across a sewage treatment network in Maresme, Spain, the concentration of benzo(k)fluoranthene was below detection limit of 4.00 ng/L(12).",

Benzo(b,k)fluoranthene was found in surficial sediments from the St. Mary's River, MI in 1985 at not detected to 67.0 mg/kg dry weight(3). Hamilton Harbor sediment cores collected in 1989 contained benzo(k)fluoranthene at concentrations of, 0-27.8, 0-11.4 and 0-4.6 ug/g at respective depths of 0-2, 2-4 and 10-12 cm(4). Bed sediments collected along a contamination gradient in the Lauritzen Canal, CA in 1993 contained benzo(k)fluoranthene at 59-1400 ng/g; the highest concentration occurring at the head of the canal(5). Bed and suspended sediment samples taken from Suisun Bay, CA contained benzo(k)fluoranthene at not detected to 34 and 34-37 ng/g dry weight, respectively(6). Mean benzo(k)fluoranthene concentrations in sediments from Arthur Kill, Hackensack River, Kill Van Kull, Passaic River, and Newark Bay, NJ were 1.3, 1.3, 0.92, 3.9, and 1.7 mg/kg dry weight, respectively; samples were collected Nov 1991 to March 1993(7). In 18 sediment samples collected Oct 28 to Nov 6, 2002 from 19 locations on the lower Missouri River, benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected at 7.0-470 ng/g dry weight(8). Seven sediment samples collected in the vicinity of a former manufactured gas plant on the Hudson River, NY contained 4.9-57.9 mg/kg of benzo(k)fluoranthene; samples were collected in 2003(9). Benzo(b,k)fluoranthene was detected in sediment samples from 114 sites from 8 historically contaminated locations in New York and North Carolina at 0.02-418 ug/g; samples were collected 2003 to 2005(10). Pore water concentrations of benzo(b,k)fluoranthene from 51 of these samples were not detected to 2.1 ng/g(10). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in sediment samples from one of seven locations on Lake Erie at 0.73 mg/kg; samples were collected in Aug 2006(11). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected at 10.4-44.2 ng/g dry weight in 24 samples collected Aug 16-19, 2011 from the southern part of Lake Michigan(12).",

Benzo(b,j,k)fluoranthene was detected at <0.05-6.3 ug/kg fresh weight in 23 lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. crispa) samples grown in private gardens Sept 1984 in southern Finland(3). Benzo(b,j,k)fluoranthene was detected in the following Finnish fat samples, ug/kg: 80% butter and vegetable oil mixture, 0.15; cooking margarines, 0.05-4.5; table margarines, not detected to 5.0; margarine, 7.2; cold pressed sunflower oil, 0.41; corn oil, 0.09; cold pressed corn oil, 2.5; rapeseed and turnip rapeseed oil, 0.66; soybean oil, 1.3 to 2.4; and coconut fat, 0.15; crude coconut oil, 91; and deodorized coconut oil, 1.0(4). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was qualitatively detected in frankfurters and Frankisch black smoked ham(5). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in uncooked, cooked, caned and frozen carrots, purchased from local markets, at 0.7, 1.8, 0.3 and 0.6 ug/kg dry weight, respectively(6). The core of carrots, grown in soil amended with sewage sludge, contained benzo(k)fluoranthene at <0.1-0.1 ug/kg fresh weight(7). Honey collected May-Oct 2007 from eight sample locations in Italy did not contained benzo(k)fluoranthene (detection limit 0.01 ng/g wet weight)(8). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was not detected in Chinese cabbage (Brassica parachinensis, paitsai (Brassica chinensis), water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica), edible amaranth (Amaranthus tricolor), mustard (Brassica juncea), lettuce (Loctuca satira), asparagus bean (Vigna sesquipedalis), shallot (Allium asclonicum), Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum), balpear (Momordica charantia) or cucumber (Cucumis sativus) samples collected from nine farms located in the Pearl River Delta, South China(9). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected at <0.010-0.201 and <0.01-0.142 ug/kg in the skin and core, respectively, of four varieties of potato and at 0.278-1.194 and 0.094-0.187 ug/kg in the skin and core, respectively, of three varieties of carrot; all vegetables were grown on organic farms in England(10).",

Softshell clams (Mya arenaria) collected June 1976 to August 1979 from a remote site and a site proximal to industry in Coos Bay, Oregon contained 1.1-3.4 and 8.5-10.9 ppb of benzo(k)fluoranthene, respectively(2). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in oysters taken in Texas waters: Galveston Bay 0.1 and 0.4 ppb in waters approved and closed for oyster harvesting, respectively; it was not detected in oysters from Aransas Bay(3). Clams (Corbicula fluminea) collected in 1992 from Orestimba Creek, Dry Creek, Mokelumne River and Stanislaus River contained <0.5 ng/g of benzo(k)fluoranthene(4). Benzo(b,k)fluoranthene isomers were detected at 0.005-1.0 ug/g dry weight in oysters taken from a variety of locations around the US(5). Asian clams (Potamocorbula amurensis) collected from eight sites of Suisun Bay, CA contained benzo(k)fluoranthene at 46-87 ng/g dry weight(6). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in common mussel (Mytlus edulis), periwinkle (Littorina littorea), limpet (Patella vulgata), sponge (Halichondria panicea) at 6-69, 3-20, trace-39 ug/kg dry weight, respectively, in samples collected April 1978 to July 1979 from fjords in Norway(7).

Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in side-stream cigarette smoke and wood smoke at mean concentrations of 1 and 13 ppm, respectively(2). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected at 2.2-5.0 ug/cigarette in mainstream smoke of 10 domestic brands of cigarettes in the US(3). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in a composite sample of three types of petroleum refinery wastes at an average concentration of 86.9 ug/g(4). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in pig and cattle slurry taken from pits on farms located at Swiss Soil Monitoring Network sites at mean concentrations of 3.3 and 6.3 ug/kg dry weight, respectively(5). Samples of compost from 3 different compost piles in Switzerland were found to contain benzo(k)fluoranthene at a range of 52-158 ug/kg dry weight with a mean of 121.3 ug/kg dry weight(5). Benzo(k)fluoranthene has been detected in combustion products from polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene(6). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected at 0.02 ug/10 g standard mineral oil(7). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in both 95% lead-free gasoline and premium leaded gasoline at a mean concentration of 0.003 mg/L(8). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in bulk coal tar at a concentration of <2,500 mg/kg(9). Benzo(j,k)fluoranthene was detected in three different vehicles fueled with gasoline, diesel, gas, and methanol/gasoline at 5.6, 0.10, 2.0 and 94 ppm, respectively(10). Benzo(b,k)fluoranthene was detected in oil collected from four Kuwait oil lakes in Sept 1992, concentration tended to increase with weathering time: initial concentrations were 0.54-23.8 mg/kg, after 21 months concentrations were 0.84-76.1 mg/kg(11).",

Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in breathing zones of a plant producing carbon anodes for aluminum electrolysis at 0.12-4.32 ug/cu m(2). The mean benzo(k)fluoranthene concentration in the breathing zone of workers of a creosote impregnation plant was 0.01 ug/cu m; in a hall where switch elements were assembled was 0.2 ug/cu m; and 0.64 ug/cu m in air near manual metal-arc welding(3). Benzo(k)fluoranthene has been detected in occupational environments at the following airborne concentrations (geometric mean), ug/cu m: coke plant, 2.30; carbon anode plant, 1.003; graphite plant, 0.074; silicon carbide plant, 0.015; metal recycling plant, 0.045; and a bitumen paving plant, 0.008(4). Benzo(k)fluoranthene was detected in the air of upper and lower floors of a Swedish alloy factory at an average of 160 and 69 ng/sample in samples collected Nov-Dec 2007 and at 240 and 140 ng/sample in samples collected Jan 2008(5). In Norwegian aluminum plant benzo(k)fluoranthene and benzo(b)fluoranthene constitute 0.8% of the total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which typically range from 1 to 4000 ug/cu m(6). The general population may be exposed to benzo(k)fluoranthene primarily through the smoking of tobacco, inhalation of polluted air and by ingestion of food and water contaminated by combustion effluents(1).",

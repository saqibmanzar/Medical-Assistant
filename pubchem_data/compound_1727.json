For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Postmarketing reports indicate that the majority of seizures have occurred in patients receiving the recommended dalfampridine dosage (generally within days to weeks after starting the drug) and in patients without a history of seizures. Some patients had been receiving other drugs that could have increased the risk of seizures or lowered the seizure threshold; in addition, age-related renal dysfunction and resultant increases in plasma dalfampridine concentrations could have contributed to the risk of seizures. Use of a high dalfampridine dosage (e.g., 15 or 20 mg twice daily) increases the risk of seizures. In open-label extension studies in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), the incidence of seizures was more than 4 times greater at a dosage of 15 mg twice daily compared with that reported with the recommended dosage (10 mg twice daily).",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Two circulating metabolites were detected in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human plasma: 3-hydroxy-4-AP and 3-hydroxy-4-AP sulfate. Although these metabolites were identified in all species, more extensive metabolism was determined in rats and dogs than in humans. In mouse and rat plasma, it was demonstrated that 4-AP-N-oxide was also a circulating metabolite. In human plasma, two unidentified metabolites were present; however, these metabolites accounted for <2% of the radioactivity.",

                        "Description": "In medicine, the term \"mechanism of action\" (also called MOA) is used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

As a result, there is a leak of potassium ions which results in the repolarization of cells and a decrease in neuronal excitability. The overall impact is the impairment of neuromuscular transmission as it is harder to trigger an action potential.  Dalfampridine inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels in the CNS to maintain the transmembrane potential and prolong action potential. In other words, dalfampridine works to make sure that the current available is high enough to stimulate conduction in demyelinated axons that are exposed in MS patients. Furthermore, it facilitates neuromuscular and synaptic transmission by relieving conduction blocks in demyelinated axons.",

Recent studies indicated that 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) can prevent the attacks in patients with episodic ataxia type 2. However, the cellular mechanism(s) by which 4-AP might be beneficial for the improvement of motor function remain unclear. Here, electrophysiological and behavioral consequences of in vivo co-treatment with 4-AP against 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP)-induced ataxia in rats were assessed. Combined treatment with 4-AP partially improved motor behavior compared to the ataxic rats. Treatment with 3-AP alone induced plastic alterations in the cells' intrinsic properties, so that the latency of the initial neural spike was significantly increased (Pb 0.001); however, both instantaneous firing frequency and amplitude of calcium spikes were significantly (Pb 0.001) suppressed. 3-AP treatment also resulted in significant decrease in the duration of action potential (Pb 0.05) and the amplitude of after hyperpolarization (Pb 0.05) as well as post-stimulus hyperpolarization potentials (Pb 0.001). Purkinje cells in rats co-treated with 4-AP, however, fired predominantly in rhythmic bursts. The mean amplitude of Ca2+ spikes was significantly (Pb 0.001) greater compared to ataxic rats, but similar to control value. As evidenced by a significant decrease (Pb 0.001) in the first spike latency, the cells' intrinsic excitability was also increased. In 4-AP co-treated group, the duration of action potential was also significantly lengthened (Pb 0.001) compared to control and 3-AP group. These results suggest that modulation of intrinsic electrical properties and potentiation of Ca2+ channels function caused by in vivo 4-AP treatment is likely to be partly responsible for its neuroprotective action.",

A Registration Standard Guidance Document was issued in September 1980 ... At the time of the Registration Standard, 4-AP was used on food crops as well as nesting and feeding areas to control nuisance birds. Several ecological toxicity, mammalian, environmental fate, and residue chemistry studies were required in a September 1980 data call-in. ... On October 27, 2004, a Federal Register Notice was published that cancelled 4-AP products with food uses (69 FR 62666) (FRL-7683-7) based on a request from the registrant. A Federal Register Notice published September 21, 2005 announced the revocation of all 4-AP tolerances. The effective date for these revocations was January 15, 2006. Subsequent to the revocation of 4-AP tolerances, the registrant requested a waiver for the outstanding data requirements based on low volume and minor use classification of the subject active ingredient and its use pattern. Based on the low potential for workers reentering the treated area to experience dermal contact with the residues of 4-AP, the Agency granted the waiver request. In 2007 the 4-AP registrant requested voluntary cancellation of all labels for products formulated as powder. Additionally, the registrant has requested voluntary cancellation for the only two 4-AP registrations remaining with uses around growing crops, and the only 4-AP registration with gull species as target pests. Thus, only the 4-AP labels for products formulated as bait have been considered for reregistration.",

In MS, axons are progressively demyelinated which exposes potassium channels. As a result, there is a leak of potassium ions which results in the repolarization of cells and a decrease in neuronal excitability. The overall impact is the impairment of neuromuscular transmission as it is harder to trigger an action potential. \nDalfampridine inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels in the CNS to maintain the transmembrane potential and prolong action potential. In other words, dalfampridine works to make sure that the current available is high enough to stimulate conduction in demyelinated axons that are exposed in MS patients. Furthermore, it facilitates neuromuscular and synaptic transmission by relieving conduction blocks in demyelinated axons.",

Moreover, prior exposure of cord-DRG explants to 0.1 mM 4-AP prevented the depressant effects of 0.1 uM morphine on DRG-evoked dorsal-horn responses, and the effects of 1-10 uM morphine were at least partly antagonized. Increased Ca++ levels (5 uM) attenuated the depression of dorsal horn responses by 1-10 uM morphine and these effects of Ca++ were greatly enhanced in the presence of 4-AP--in some cultures, concentrations of morphine as high as 100 uM were strongly antagonized during test periods up to 2 hours. Receptor assays showed that 0.1 mM 4-AP +/- 5 mM Ca++ had no effect on stereospecific opiate binding, indicating that the antagonist actions of these agents in our cultures do not occur at the level of the opiate receptor. The relevance of our in vitro studies of 4-AP antagonism of opiate-depressant effects on sensory-evoked dorsal-horn network responses for analyses of problems in opiate analgesia has been strengthened by a recent report demonstrating that 4-AP does, in fact, reverse morphine analgesia in rats, as determined by tail flick tests.",

Verapamil, administered as a bolus (0.72 mg/kg) followed by a continuous infusion (0.11 mg/kg/min), decreased cardiac output (CO) ... heart rate (HR) ... left ventricular derivative of pressure with respect to time (LV dP/dt) ... mean aortic pressure (AO) ... and stroke volume. ... 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) increased heart rate, cardiac output, LV dP/dt, and mean aortic pressure. When administered prior to verapamil, 4-AP prevented the development of verapamil toxicity as shown by the significantly higher mean aortic pressure (P less than 0.001), cardiac output (P less than 0.01), and LV dP/dt (P less than 0.01) when 4-AP followed by verapamil was compared to verapamil alone. In conclusion, there does not appear to be a single specific therapy for verapamil toxicity, however it can be partially correctedly presently available pharmacologic therapy and 4-AP.",

It enhances neuronal conduction at synapses and is indicated in the treatment of selected neuromuscular disorders, including multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis, among others. Its documented toxicity generally has been limited to central nervous system (CNS) hyperexcitation and gastrointestinal upset. In this case, a 56-year-old man accidentally overdosed on an unknown amount of generic 4-AP. This history was unknown by his family and unavailable to initial providers. Approximately 1 hr after ingestion, his son found him diaphoretic, vomiting, and having unintelligible speech. In the ensuing 2-3 hr, the patient became moderately hypothermic (32.8 degrees C; 91 degrees F), developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and had neurological changes that were confused with an acute cerebrovascular accident. After a 36-hr stay in the intensive care unit that included mechanical ventilation, cardioversion, passive rewarming, and an extensive medical workup, the patient recovered without sequelae. After extubation he stated that he thought he may have ingested too much 4-AP after rubbing a large amount of it against a sore tooth to take advantage of its local analgesic properties. This case of 4-AP overdose resulting in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypothermia, and acute neurological changes mistaken for an acute cerebrovascular accident is an unusual one. This case shows that overdose of 4-AP can cause or mimic several serious medical conditions, and that a detailed history and physical examination are essential for uncovering unusual diagnoses.",

In rabbits, the median lethal dose was 23 mg/kg (both sexes). In dogs, no toxicities were evident at total daily doses of up to 5 mg/kg four times a day. In general, death occurred short after administration (on the day of dosing). It was noted that findings of the single dose toxicity studies coincided with the short half-life of fampridine and suggested that toxicity is related to peak plasma levels rather than overall exposure. Most notable treatment related acute clinical observations were CNS effects and included excessive salivation, tremor, seizures, convulsions, ataxia, dyspnoea, dilated pupils, prostration, abnormal vocalisation, increased respiration, excess salivation, gait abnormalities and hyper- and hypo-excitability. These findings were in line with those described in overdose reports in humans, including confusion, tremulousness, diaphoresis, seizure, amnesia and rare cases of hallucinations.",

The anatomical pathology, the biochemical and hematological parameters were analyzed and a real-time PCR array analysis was developed with an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The leucocytes number, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzymatic activity were increased at all dose but the erythrocytes number, the hemoglobin concentration, the alkaline phosphatase (FAL) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzymatic activity were increased only at highest dose studied. However, glucose levels decreased at all doses. The biochemical results are indicative of hepatic damage. The anatomy pathology studies showed cell death only on liver and kidney, and the real-time PCR array on liver tissue expressed a gene expression profile of necrotic and apoptotic induced cell death. ...",

There were also some changes in brain weights (increased in rat, decreased in dog) and liver weights (increased in rat). The NOAELs of these two studies were 30 ppm (1.5 mg/kg bw/day) and 1.0 mg/kg bw/day for rats and dogs, respectively.

Most of these symptoms are associated with hypercholinergic activity. In general, onset of signs occurs within 10-15 min and death occurs within 15 min to 4 hr. ... Predators such as raptors, foxes, hawks, cats and dogs die from secondary poisoning after feeding on the dead or dying birds.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.09X10-4 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates 4-aminopyridine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-aminopyridine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 hrs. 4-Aminopyridine absorbs UV light above 290 nm, but it is reported to be stable to direct photolysis. If released to soil, 4-aminopyridine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 39. The pKa of 4-aminopyridine is 9.17, indicating that this compound will exist predominantly in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. In addition, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Although 4-aminopyridine's vapor pressure suggests volatilization from dry soil surfaces will not be an important fate process, a screening study using sterilized soil measured a 14.9% loss of 4-aminopyridine to volatilization over a 64-day observation period. Aerobic and anaerobic degradation occurs very slowly in soil. Aerobic biotic half-lives of 4-aminopyridine in soil are reported to range between 3 and 32 months. If released into water, 4-aminopyridine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. However, 4-aminopyridine cations and reactivity of the amino group may result in some aquatic adsorption. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant.  A measured BCF range of <0.2-7.2 in carp (Cyprinus carpio) suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 4-Aminopyridine is expected to be stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions. Available data indicates biodegradation in water is slow. Sensitized photo-oxidation may occur in shallow natural waters exposed to sunlight with a half-life on the order of one month. Occupational exposure to 4-aminopyridine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-aminopyridine is produced or used. The general population may be exposed through dermal contact with bird repellent products containing 4-aminopyridine. Small children and toddlers could accidentally ingest treated granules when 4-aminopyridine is applied in residential or public areas. 4-Aminopyridine's use as a drug in treatment of multiple sclerosis results in a limited population direct exposure through ingestion.

The pKa of 4-aminopyridine is 9.17(3), indicating that this compound will exist predominantly  in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). In addition, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(5,6), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). Volatilization of 4-aminopyridine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.09X10-4 mm Hg(7), and water solubility, 1.12X10+5 mg/L(7). Although 4-aminopyridine's vapor pressure suggests volatilization from dry soil surfaces will not be an important fate process(SRC), a screening study using sterilized soil measured a 14.9% loss of 4-aminopyridine to volatilization over a 64-day observation period(8). Aerobic and anaerobic degradation occurs very slowly in soil(8,9). Aerobic biotic half-lives of 4-aminopyridine in soil are reported to range between 3 and 32 months(7).",

According to a classification scheme(9), a BCF range of <0.2-7.2 measured in carp (Cyprinus carpio)(10) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A 0% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(10) suggests that 4-aminopyridine is not readily biodegradable under environmental conditions(SRC). Another screening test found very slow biodegradation in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions(11). 4-Aminopyridine is expected to be stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions(8). Aromatic amines are susceptible to sensitized photo-oxidation via peroxy, hydroxyl and singlet oxygen radicals in natural waters exposed to sunlight with shallow surface water half-lives on the order of one month(12); therefore, some sensitized photo-oxidation of 4-aminopyridine may occur in natural water(SRC).",

In a screening test, which utilized 5 mL garden soil suspensions with glucose, yeast extract and mineral salts, 4-aminopyridine completely degraded in greater than 170 days under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions(2). For flooded soils, 76.4 and 79.0% of the original radio labeled 4-aminopyridine was mineralized to CO2 within 60 days in a Fargo clay and Barnes sandy loam soil at 20 \u00b0C and pHs of 7.7, and 7.4, respectively(3).

An acclimated aerobic soil grab sample study demonstrated slow biodegradation of  4-aminopyridine(5). 4-Aminopyridine was added to Fincastle silt loam (Aeric Ochraqualf) with a pH of 6.7 and incubated at 25 \u00b0C(5); within 64 days, 6.1% of the available nitrogen was released to inorganic forms(5); sterilized controls lost 14.9% of the starting material to volatilization, but did not release inorganic nitrogen(5).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 19 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 4-Aminopyridine absorbs UV-light at wavelengths >290 nm(2,3) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). However, 4-aminopyridine is reported to be stable to light(4). Aromatic amines are susceptible to sensitized photo-oxidation via peroxy, hydroxyl and singlet oxygen radicals in natural waters exposed to sunlight with shallow surface water half-lives on the order of one month(5); therefore, some sensitized photo-oxidation of 4-aminopyridine may occur in natural water(SRC). 4-Aminopyridine is expected to be stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 4-aminopyridine is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water surfaces(2). 4-Aminopyridine's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to occur(SRC). Although 4-aminopyridine's vapor pressure suggests volatilization from dry soil surfaces will not be an important fate process(SRC), a screening study using sterilized soil measured a 14.9% loss of 4-aminopyridine to volatilization over a 64-day observation period(3).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).

During DNA synthesis and cellular reproduction, folic acid is reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by the enzyme folic acid reductase. By interfering with the reduction of folic acid, trimetrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Generally, the most sensitive cells to the antimetabolite effect of trimetrexate are those cells which are most actively proliferating such as malignant cells, dermal epithelium, buccal and intestinal mucosa, bone marrow, fetal cells, and cells of the urinary bladder. Because the proliferation of cells in malignant tissues is greater than in most normal tissues, trimetrexate may impair the growth of the malignant tissues without causing irreversible damage to normal tissues. Due to very serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects of this drug, leucovorin must be co-administered for at least 72 hours after the last dose.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

When given with leucovorin, however, trimetrexate has fewer side effects although serum enzyme elevations can still occur. In clinical trials in patients with HIV infection and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, ALT elevations above 5 times ULN occurred in 1% to 8% of patients, but were usually no more frequent than with standard therapy using trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole. The elevations were typically transient, without accompanying symptoms or jaundice and resolved or improved despite continuation of therapy. No instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury attributed to trimetrexate have been reported in the literature. In addition, trimetrexate has not been linked to sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or to reactivation of hepatitis B. Nevertheless, trimetrexate probably has hepatotoxic potential, but because it has limited use, is given for short periods of time and is administered with leucovorin, it has not been convincingly linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.",

Although data are limited, management may be guided by the dose administered, time elapsed since administration, and anticipated severity of neurotoxicity. Regardless of the dose administered, as soon as the overdose is recognized, a repeat lumbar puncture should be performed immediately and CSF allowed to drain to gravity. The efficacy of CSF drainage alone as a means for removing the drug is a function of the dose administered and time elapsed since administration, and decreases as these factors increase. If the dose exceeds 100 mg, prompt neurosurgical intervention with ventriculolumbar perfusion following immediate CSF drainage should be considered; continuous CSF drainage or multiple CSF exchanges may also be considered but are not likely to be as effective. Other treatment measures may include high-dose parenteral leucovorin calcium therapy to minimize systemic toxicity, corticosteroids to minimize CNS inflammatory reactions, and other supportive therapy as necessary. While the addition of leucovorin to the ventriculolumbar perfusion fluid has been suggested and employed, its value is not known and the possibility that it may be epileptogenic via this route of administration should be considered. The possible benefits of prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy are probably outweighed by the potential for obscuring acute neurologic symptoms and causing additional adverse effects. /Methotrexate/",

When large doses or overdoses of methotrexateare given, leucovorin calcium may be administered by iv infusion in doses up to 75 mg within 12 hr, followed by 12 mg im every 6 hr for 4 doses. Other leucovorin calcium dosage regimens are also recommended. When average doses of methotrexate appear to have an adverse effect, 6-12 mg of leucovorin calcium may be given im every 6 hr for 4 doses. Leucovorin calcium has been administered several hr following high-dose methotrexate therapy in an effort to control the duration of exposure of sensitive cells to methotrexate (\"leucovorin rescue\"); the manufacturers warn that this procedure is considered investigational and hazardous. /Methotrexate/",

Adverse effects reported in AIDS patients have included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, reversible liver function abnormalities, skin rash, and fever. In cancer patients treated with trimetrexate (without leucovorin), hematologic toxicities have also been observed.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

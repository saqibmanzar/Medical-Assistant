The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis was significantly stimulated by PK 11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide) and Ro5 4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam), ligands which bind to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors with high affinity. Low-affinity ligands for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor such as Ro15 1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5 alpha][1,4] benzo-3-carboxylate) and clonazepam had no significant effect on the rate of pregnenolone synthesis. Furthermore, the rank order of potency of these compounds as inhibitors of [3H]Ro5 4864 binding was identical to the rank order for steroid production. Since the 86-amino acid peptide diazepam binding inhibitor is also thought to bind to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, four fragments of this peptide, a random sequence and steroidogenesis activator peptide were also evaluated for their ability to interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and to stimulate steroidogenesis in rat brain mitochondria. Steroidogenesis activator peptide and two fragments of diazepam binding inhibitor significantly stimulated pregnenolone biosynthesis. In contrast to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands, no correlation between peptide potency in displacing [3H]Ro5 4864 binding and steroidogenesis was observed.",

They are found in many other tissues too, including liver. We studied the effect of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands PK11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)isoquinoline-3-carboxa mid e], Ro 5-4864 (4-chlorodiazepam), hemin, protoporphyrin IX and N-methyl protoporphyrin IX on cholesterol mitochondrial intermembrane transport of cholesterol in vitro in rat liver. Endogenous cholesterol translocation from outer to inner mitochondrial membranes was significantly increased by PK11195 and N-methyl protoporphyrin IX (140% and 150% increase, respectively, at 1 microM, P<0.01). 5 microM protoporphyrin IX, 1 microM Ro 5-4864 and 5 microM hemin was ineffective. When mitochondria were labeled with exogenous [4-14C]cholesterol, PK11195 and N-methyl protoporphyrin IX were the most effective in increasing total cholesterol incorporation and cholesterol translocation into inner membranes, and their effect was dose-dependent. These data suggest that in liver the binding to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors is related to cholesterol translocation and the interaction of ligands with these receptors may play a role in the complex mechanism of regulation of cholesterol traffic between liver mitochondrial membranes.",

Uteri obtained from all groups developed a spontaneous, rhythmic activity. The spontaneous activity observed in control uterus was either inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by diazepam, 4'-chlorodiazepam, clonazepam or 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxam ide (PK 11195), or was abolished in [Ca2+]o-free solution. Diazepam, 4'-chlorodiazepam, clonazepam and PK 11195 all caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the [K+]o-pre-contracted uterus with the relative order of potency: PK 11195 > 4'-chlorodiazepam > diazepam > clonazepam. Administration of [Ca2+]o (1 microM to 10 mM) caused a concentration-dependent contraction of uterus, bathed in [Ca2+]o-free physiological salt solution obtained from different pre-treatment groups. Incubation with different concentrations (uM) of diazepam, 4'-chlorodiazepam, clonazepam and PK 11195 caused a decrease in response to [Ca2+]o-induced contraction in all groups of rat uteri. These results indicate that micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites exist in rat uterus. Diazepam, 4'-chlorodiazepam, clonazepam and PK 11195 caused relaxation of pre-contracted rat uterus and this effect may involve the inhibition of influx of [Ca2+]o and the relaxing effects of different benzodiazepines observed in this study can be modulated by pre-treatment with different female hormones.",

Cotransfection of human alpha 2, beta 1, and gamma 2 subunits was capable of reconstituting a 4'-chlorodiazepam recognition site as revealed by a dose-dependent potentiation of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]-TBPS) binding to the GABA-activated chloride channel. This site is found on GABAA receptor complexes containing sites for GABA agonist-like benzodiazepines and neuroactive steroids. The importance of the alpha subunit was further demonstrated as substitution of either alpha 1 or alpha 3 for the alpha 2 subunit did not reconstitute a 4'-chlorodiazepam recognition site that was capable of modulating [35S]TBPS binding under the same experimental conditions. The 4'-chlorodiazepam modulatory site was shown to be distinct from the benzodiazepine site, but the phenylquinolines PK 8165 and PK 9084 produced effects similar to 4'-chlorodiazepam, consistent with the previous analysis of the 4'-chlorodiazepam site in brain homogenates. Further analysis of the subunit requirements revealed that coexpression of alpha 2 and beta 1 alone reconstituted a 4'-chlorodiazepam recognition site. It is interesting, however, that the 4'-chlorodiazepam site was found to inhibit [35S]TBPS binding to the GABA-activated chloride channel. Thus, the 4'-chlorodiazepam site may be reconstituted with only the alpha and beta polypeptides.",

Onset of susceptibility to a dose of Ro5-4864 which caused a high frequency of clonic seizures in adults was observed at 10 days of age in DBA/2 mice, but not until 35 days in BALB/c By mice. At 14 days of age an abrupt increase in susceptibility to Ro5-4864-induced tonic seizures was found in DBA/2 but not BALB/c By mice. Both the peak of tonic seizure susceptibility (21 days) and the time course of its subsequent age-dependent decline closely paralleled the change in audiogenic seizure susceptibility in the DBA/2 strain. PK11195 (40 mg/kg) blocked Ro5-4864 (25 mg/kg)-induced, age-dependent tonic seizures but had no effect on clonic seizure induction in the same mice. These observations establish that both the susceptibility to Ro5-4864 in adult mice and the postnatal time course for development of susceptibility to this convulsant are inherently different in these two strains of mice. The lack of coincidence between the developmental onset of susceptibility to Ro5-4864-induced seizures and the onset of supersensitivity to Ro5-4864-induced tonic seizures during the period of peak audiogenic seizure susceptibility in DBA/2 mice implies that more than one neurochemical mechanism is involved in the ability of Ro5-4864 to induce seizures in this strain. However, the blockade of Ro5-4864-induced tonic seizures by PK11195 suggests that peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors may mediate this effect.",

Within the dose range 0.25-0.75 mg kg-1, the triazolo compounds had marked activity, decreasing the number of correct responses and increasing total response time. The triazino was less potent and the imidazo compounds were the least likely to disrupt performance. Smaller doses (0.005, 0.01 and 0.05 mg kg-1) of triazolam did not impair performance on the tasks, and larger doses of imidazo (1.0, 3.0 and 7.5 mg kg-1) were without effect on delayed alternation. Within the dose range 1.0-10.0 mg kg-1, 4'- chlorodiazepam was without effect and only the largest dose of diazepam and 2'- chlorodiazepam impaired performance. 2'- Chloronordiazepam decreased the number of correct responses at all doses (1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mg kg-1) and with the largest dose, the total response time was increased. The studies suggest that the effects of a drug on higher nervous function in the monkey cannot easily be predicted from standard pharmacological tests in other animals or other species of monkey.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

At doses of 900 mg/kg bw, the insoluble polyureas usually lined the stomach, slowing down or preventing the migration of stomach contents into the intestine. At a 60 mg/kg dose level, these results were not observed. Most 2,6-TDI-derived materials were eliminated in the feces or were found in the GI tract 72 hr after dosing. Approx 12% of the low dose (60 mg/kg bw) and only 5% of the high dose (900 mg/kg bw) were excreted in the urine (24 hr after treatment). Increased urinary excretion of 2,6-TDI metabolites with decreasing dosage was consistent with the lower concentration of the compound in the stomach permitting increasing amounts of the 2,6-TDI to be hydrolyzed completely to monomeric 2,6-diaminotoluene rather than forming polymers. The 2,6-diaminotoluene could than be absorbed, acetylated, and excreted in the urine. Materials derived from 2,6-TDI were not concentrated in any tissue.",

The toluene diisocyanate, concentrations in air varied between 0.4 and 4 ug/cu m in one plant and in the other between 10 and 120 ug/cu m. In one of the plants, the plasma 2,4-toluene diamine levels were 0.4-1 ug/mL before a 4-5 week holiday and 0.2-0.5 ug/mL afterwards. The corresponding plasma levels of 2,6-toluene diamine were 2-6 and 0.5-2 ug/mL, respectively. In the other plant, the plasma 2,4 toluene diamine concentrations were 2-23 ng/mL before the holiday and 0.5-6 ng/mL afterwards and those of 2,6-toluene diamine were 7-24 ng/mL before and 3-6 ng/mL afterwards. The plasma concentrations of 2,4-toluene diamine were, 2-24 ng/mL before a 12 day holiday, and 1-14 ng/mL afterwards. The corresponding values for plasma 2,6-toluene diamine were 12-29 and 8-17 ng/mL, respectively. The urinary elimination rates for 2,4-toluene diamine before the, holiday were 0.04-0.54 and 0.02-0.18 ug/hr afterwards. The corresponding values for 2,6-toluene diamine were 0.18-0.76 ug/hr before and 0.09-0.27 ug/hr after the holiday. The half life in urine ranged from 5.8 to 11 days for 2,4 and 2,6 toluene diamines. The differences in exposure were reflected by the plasma toluene diamine concentrations. The mean half life in plasma was 21 (range, 14-34) days for 2,4-toluene diamine and 21 (16-26) days for 2,6-toluene diamine, The study showed that the half life in plasma of chronically exposed workers for 2,4- and 2,6-toluene diamine was twice as long as for volunteers with short term exposure. An indication of a two phase elimination pattern in urine was found. The first phase was related to the more recent exposure and the second, much slower one was probably related to release of toluene diamines in urine from toluene diisocyanate adducts in the body.",

The toluene diisocyanate atmospheres were generated by a gas-phase permeation method, & the exposures were performed in an 8-cu m stainless-steel test chamber. The effective exposure period was 4 hr. The isomeric composition of the air in the test chamber was 30% 2,4-toluene diisocyanate & 70% 2,6-toluene diisocyanate. The concentration of toluene diisocyanate in air of the test chamber was determined by an HPLC method using the 9-(N-methyl-amino-methyl)-anthracene reagent & by a continuous-monitoring filter-tape instrument. Following the hydrolysis of plasma & urine, the related amines, 2,4-toluenediamine & 2,6-toluenediamine, were determined as pentafluoropropionic anhydride derivatives by capillary gas chromatography using selected ion monitoring in the electron impact mode. In plasma, 2,4- & 2,6-toluenediamine showed a rapid-phase elimination half-time of ca 2-5 hr, & that for the slow phase was >6 days. A connection was observed between concn of 2,4- & 2,6-toluene diisocyanate in air & the levels of 2,4- & 2,6-toluenediamine in plasma. The cumulated amount of 2,4-toluenediamine excreted in the urine over 24 hr was ca 15%-19% of the estimated inhaled dose of 2,4-toluene diisocyanate, & that of 2,6-toluenediamine was ca 17%-23% of the inhaled dose of 2,6-toluene diisocyanate. A connection was found between the cumulated (24 hr) urinary excretion of 2,4- & 2,6-toluenediamine & the air concentratio of 2,4- & 2,6-toluene diisocyanate in the test chamber.",

TDIs have been documented as the leading cause of occupational asthma. Skin exposure to TDI in the workplace is common. However, no studies in the literature have investigated the exact biomarker concentration profile for skin TDI absorption through any in vivo animal studies. In this study a rat model was used to evaluate the TDI skin absorption to explore the dose-response pattern and to determine the kinetic characteristics of urinary toluene diamine (U-TDA) during skin exposure. TDIs were topically exposed on the dorsum of rat skin at 0.2%, 1% and 5%. Consecutive urine samples were collected for 6 days and U-TDA were analysed using GC/ECD. It was demonstrated in this rat study that absorption of 2,4- and 2,6-TDI through skin contact is possible. A clear dose-dependent skin absorption relationship for 2,4- and 2,6-TDI was demonstrated by the AUC, Cmax findings and accumulative amounts (r > or = 0.968). U-TDA concentration profiles in 6-day consecutive urine samples fit well in the first-order kinetics, although higher order kinetics could not be excluded for the high dose. The apparent half-lives for excretory urinary TDA were about 20 hr consistent at various skin exposures. It is concluded that skin absorption of TDI was confirmed in a rat model and a clear dose-dependent skin absorption relationship for 2,4- and 2,6-TDI was demonstrated. Excretory U-TDA concentrations in 6-day consecutive urine samples via skin exposure reveal the first-order kinetics and the half-lives were about 20 hr.",

The device is constructed from a 37 mm aerosol cassette. The collection medium used in the dosimeter is 0.5% sulfuric acid. Membranes of both the permeation and diffusion types were evaluated for use in the dosimeter. Microporous teflon diffusion membranes exhibited superior performance in terms of surface effects (mass transfer coefficient <0.006 ug/ppb/hr) and residual TDI (not detected) and were chosen for use. Collected TDI is determined as toluenediamine by either colorimetry using a modification of the Marcali technique or fluorometry using fluorescamine reagent. The manufacturer claims an accuracy of + or - 15%. A significant dependence on wind speed was minimized by use of a second microporous membrane as a wind screen. The mass transfer rate of TDI was found to be approximately 0.0152 ug/ppb/hr and was equivalent for the 2,4- and 2,6- isomers of TDI.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

In all cases RAST and/or skin-test investigations revealed the presence of IgE antibodies reacting specifically with HSA conjugated with those isocyanates to which workers were exposed as well as with other isocyanates with which they had not been in contact. By the RAST inhibition technique, moderate to strong mutual cross-reactivities between all tested isocyanate-HSA conjugates--even between aromatic and aliphatic ones--could be demonstrated in tests with five sera. The magnitudes of cross-reactivities differed, however, from one patient to another. One serum contained IgE antibodies that were almost completely specific to TDI-HSA; with this serum only weak cross-reactivities with other isocyanate conjugates could be demonstrated. These results indicate the predominance of closely related antigenic determinants in HSA conjugated with different isocyanates. The common antibody-binding regions are obviously recognized to different extents by antibodies of clinically sensitized workers, indicating individual differences in specificities and avidities of antibody populations. Nearly complete lack of IgE binding of ovalbumin-bound TDI in RAST and RAST inhibition indicates carrier-specific antigenicity of isocyanate-protein conjugates. In addition, since unmodified HSA did not bind IgE, antigenic determinants of the conjugates studied should be predominantly formed by the isocyanate-protein bond regions and concurrently by neighboring amino acid residues of the HSA molecule. /Isocyanates/",

These compounds are potent pulmonary sensitizers which cause bronchospasm, even in patients without prior airway hyperreactivity. Diisocyanate compounds act either as inducers of nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity or as direct pharmacologic agonists. Isocyanates apparently have the potential to sensitize certain segments of the population. Elevated humoral antibodies (ie, specific IgE antibodies to the p-tolyl determinant but not the diisocyanate conjugate) were detected in sensitized workers, but cell-mediated immunity also may produce hypersensitivity reactions. In the absence of renewed exposure, radioallergosorbent titers may not distinguish sensitive from nonsensitized workers. At high doses, toluene diisocyanate may act directly on bronchial mucosa by interfering with cholinergic and adrenergic mechanisms. /Isocyanates/",

An isocyanate-exposed worker may first develop an asthmatic condition (i.e., become sensitized) after a single (acute) exposure, but sensitization usually takes a few months to several years of exposure. The asthmatic reaction may occur minutes after exposure (immediate), several hours after exposure (late), or a combination of both immediate and late components after exposure (dual). The late asthmatic reaction is the most common, occurring in approximately 40% of isocyanate sensitized workers. After sensitization, any exposure, even to levels below an occupational exposure limit or standard, can produce an asthmatic response that may be life threatening. Experience with isocyanates has shown that monomeric, prepolymeric and polyisocyanate species are capable of producing respiratory sensitization in exposed workers. /Isocyanates/",

Groups of 50 male F344/N rats received 30 or 60 mg/kg and groups of 50 male B6C3F1 mice received 120 or 240 mg/kg on the same schedule. Dosage analyses of toluene diisocyanate indicated that the chemical had reacted in the corn oil vehicle, resulting in actual gavage concentrations 77% to 90% of theoretical values. Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex received corn oil only and served as vehicle controls. Survival in all groups of dosed rats in the 2-year studies was shorter (P less than or equal to 0.005) than that of the controls; depressions in mean body weight gain relative to controls were greater than 10% in all dosed rat groups throughout most of the study. A dose-dependent pattern of cumulative toxicity began at 70 weeks and culminated in excessive mortality, indicating the estimated maximum tolerated dose had been exceeded for rats. Acute bronchopneumonia occurred at increased incidences in groups of dosed male and female rats (males: control, 2/50; low dose, 6/50; high dose, 14/50; females: 1/50, 10/50, 25/49). /Results indicated that/ commercial grade toluene diisocyanate in corn oil was carcinogenic for F344/N rats, causing subcutaneous fibromas and fibrosarcomas (combined) in males and females, pancreatic acinar cell adenomas in males, and pancreatic islet cell adenomas, neoplastic nodules of the liver, and mammary gland fibroadenomas in females. Toluene diisocyanate was not carcinogenic for male B6C3F1 mice. TDI was carcinogenic for female B6C3F1 mice, causing hemangiomas or hemangiosarcomas (combined), as well as hepatocellular adenomas.",

Commercial toluene diisocyanate (TDI) typically contains 20% of 2,6-toluene diisocyanate. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.02 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,6-toluene diisocyanate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,6-toluene diisocyanate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 hrs. Atmospheric degradation may also occur through contact with clouds, fog or rain. 2,6-Toluene diisocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to moist soil, 2,6-toluene diisocyanate is not expected to adsorb to solids and sediments due to its rapid degradation reaction with water. Based upon data for the mixture, if spilled on wet land, 2,6-toluene diisocyanate is rapidly degraded by reaction with moisture. In one experiment simulating a spill, 5.5% of the original material remained after 24 hours and in a field situation; the concentration of TDI had declined to the ppm level in 12 weeks. If released to water, 2,6-toluene diisocyanate is not expected to leach or adsorb to solids due to its rapid degradation reaction with water. If released into water in a spill situation, a crust forms around the liquid TDI mixture and <0.5% of the original material remains after 35 days. At low concentrations, TDI hydrolyzes in the aqueous environment in approximately one day; therefore, bioconcentration is not expected to be an important environmental fate process. Occupational exposure to 2,6-toluene diisocyanate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,6-toluene diisocyanate is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 2,6-toluene diisocyanate via use of consumer products, such as polyurethane, containing this compound. (SRC)",

Ten days after a spill of 13 tons of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (2,4- plus 2,6-isomers) onto a swampy, wet forest soil, TDI and toluenediamines were found in the soil(2,3). The TDI solidified and the area was covered with sand. The soil concentration of TDI and toluenediamine combined declined from the parts per thousand to parts per million range between 10 days and 12 weeks after the spill(3). One year later, neither TDI nor toluenediamine could be found in soil samples(4). After 6 years, only TDI-derived polyureas were found at the site in soil samples at depths to 100 cm(4). In a simulated spill, 5 kg of TDI in a container was covered with 50 kg of sand and 5 kg of water at ambient temperatures and samples were taken from the top and bottom of the sand pile(3); after 24 hours, 5.5% of the TDI remained unreacted and after 8 days 3.5% remained(3); the reaction product was largely polyureas(3).",

Since 2,6-toluene diisocyanate hydrolyzes rapidly(1), bioconcentration is not likely to occur(SRC). Based upon data for the mixture, 2,6-toluene diisocyanate may not be persistent in the environment(SRC). When low concentrations of TDI (2,4- plus 2,6-isomers) are released into model river or seaway systems, it is hydrolyzed within a day(3). In order to simulate a spill of TDI in stagnant water, 0.5 liters of TDI was poured into 20 liters of water at pH 5, 7, or 9 at 20 \u00b0C. A hard compact crust formed at the water-TDI interface(2). This crust thickened over a period of 30 days until no liquid TDI remained. The solid crust contained <0.5% of the original TDI after 35 days(2). Another experiment was performed to simulate a spill into running water by pouring 0.5 liters of TDI into 20 liters of slowly overflowing water. Trace amounts of toluenediamine were present in the overflow samples. As in the stagnant water simulation, a crust formed that contained <0.5% of the original TDI after 35 days(2).",

Experiments were performed in an environmental chamber to assess the importance of photolysis, reaction with free radicals, and adsorption onto particulate matter as atmospheric removal processes(3); the loss rate of TDI (2,4- plus 2,6-isomers) in irradiated clean air was first order with a half-life of 3.3 hr(3); it was shown that free radicals, and not photolysis, was responsible for the removal(3); the half-life was consistent with estimated reaction rates via hydroxyl radicals(3); adsorption to particulate matter was negligible(3). In order to simulate a spill of TDI in stagnant water, 0.5 liters of TDI was poured into 20 liters of water at pH 5, 7, or 9 at 20 \u00b0C. A hard compact crust formed at the water-TDI interface(4). This crust thickened over a period of 30 days until no liquid TDI remained. The solid crust contained <0.5% of the original TDI after 35 days(4). Another experiment was performed to simulate a spill into running water by pouring 0.5 liters of TDI into 20 liters of slowly overflowing water. Barely detectable amounts of toluenediamine were present in the overflow samples. As in the stagnant water simulation, a crust formed that contained <0.5% of the original TDI after 35 days(4). /Toluene diisocyanate/",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Concentration ranges of worker exposure in a polyurethane foam plant were 8 to 138 ug/cu m in gases and not detected to 137 ug/cu m in aerosols(2). Workplace air of a factory manufacturing polyurethane coated wire contained TDI (2,4- plus 2,6-isomers) levels ranging from <1-740 ug/cu m(3). While 2,4-toluene diisocyanate constitutes 80% of TDI, and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate 20%, the 2,4-isomer is more reactive so that the concentration of the 2,6-isomer is higher in work place air(2). TDI levels of 1.3-2.8 ppb were detected in the air inside a factory manufacturing polyurethanes(4). Mean TDI levels (2,4- plus 2,6-isomers) of 0.7-180 ug/cu m were reported for workplace air in USA factories (1973-8) manufacturing TDI(5).

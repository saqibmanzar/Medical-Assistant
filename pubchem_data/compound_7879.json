PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.6X10-17 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride will exist only in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1X10+10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the (estimated) Koc. Dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride biodegradation in river water is found to take place in 4.9-13.8 days. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 71 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride is produced or used. The general population may be exposed via the use of consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 71(SRC), from a log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride biodegradation in river water is found to take place in 4.9-13.8 days(7,8), and an OECD and Zahn-Wellens screening test found degradation takes place in 2-10 days(2).",

Dimethyldioctadecylammonium degradation in rapid creek river water, in Rapid City, SD, was measured with a half life of 4.9-13.8 days(3). In an OECD screening test, at a 2.5 mg/l concentration, dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride degradation reaches over 90% in 2-4 days and at 10 mg/l concentration, a Zahn-Wellen test found degradation is nearly complete in 10 days(2). A 91-95% dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride removal rate was observed in a continuous flow activated sludge system(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

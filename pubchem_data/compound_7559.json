When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In the majority of cases, the selected esters were hydrolyzed rapidly by pancreatin. Additional investigations were undertaken on 8 esters (isoamylacetate, ethylacetate, allyltiglate, 1,3-dimethylbutylacetate, benzyltiglate, methyl-N-methylanthranilate, methylanthranilate and dimethylbenzylcarbinyl acetate) not rapidly hydrolyzed using whole homogenates of pig jejunum and liver. There was wide variation in the degree of in vitro hydrolysis of flavoring esters depending on the source of enzymes used. Those esters hydrolyzed rapidly in vitro will possibly also be degraded readily in the intact animal.",

Its use in the manufacture of synthetic perfumes may result in its direct release to the environment. Methyl phenylacetate is a component of various plant species and some Mycobacterium species. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.13 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates methyl phenylacetate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl phenylacetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8.6 days. Methyl phenylacetate does not absorb UV light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methyl phenylacetate is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 74. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl phenylacetate has a vapor pressure of 0.13 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, methyl phenylacetate may volatilize from dry soil. Utilizing the Closed Bottle test, 75% degradation was reached in 28 days indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, methyl phenylacetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 28 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 7.5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Methyl phenylacetate may undergo slow hydrolysis in alkaline soils and waters. Occupational exposure to methyl phenylacetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl phenylacetate is produced or used. Limited monitoring data and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methyl phenylacetate via ingestion of food, smoking cigarettes and inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing methyl phenylacetate.

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

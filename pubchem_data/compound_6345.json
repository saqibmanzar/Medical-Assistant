It has been evaluated by standard studies of toxicity, developmental toxicity, and genotoxicity. In addition, the metabolism and disposition of HFC32 was investigated and a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PB-PK) model constructed /using rats and rabbits/. ... The pharmacokinetics of [(14)C]difluoromethane (10,000 to 50,000 ppm/6 hr) revealed that about 2.1% of the inhaled HFC32 was absorbed and that steady state blood levels were achieved within 2 hr and were proportional to dose. Carbon dioxide was the major metabolite of HFC32 at all exposure levels. Carbon monoxide was not detected. The in vivo data were used to validate a PB-PK model to describe the uptake and metabolism of HFC32. Absorption and distribution are adequately described using rat blood:air and tissue:air partition coefficients. Metabolism, which was linear across the dose range, was described by a first order rate constant (Kf = 8.98 hr-1). Of the absorbed HFC32, about 63% was metabolized at all doses; however, when metabolism was expressed as a percentage of the inhaled dose it was much lower, being about 1.4% of the HFC32 entering the airways. ...",

The metabolism and disposition of [(14)C]-difluoromethane ([(14)C]-HFC32) was determined in male Swiss mice as a consequence of a single 6 hr inhalation exposure to atmospheres of 10,000 ppm. Of the inhaled dose, about 1-2% was recovered in expired air, urine, feces and carcass suggesting that systemic absorption of this hydrofluorocarbon from the alveolar air space of the lung into blood is poor. Upon cessation of exposure the majority of the systemically absorbed HFC32 was exhaled within 1 hr. Carbon dioxide was a major metabolite of HFC32. Carbon dioxide measured post-exposure accounted for about 0.3% of the inhaled dose. Urinary and fecal excretion of non-volatile metabolites accounted for about 0.34% and 0.07% of the inhaled dose, respectively. Carbon monoxide could not be detected. Total metabolism, measured as the sum of the radioactivity recovered in urine, feces, as carbon dioxide and that retained in the carcass, amounted to about 0.8% of the inhaled dose, equivalent to 64% of the total radioactivity recovered. Analysis of a range of tissues at 4 days post-exposure showed a relatively uniform distribution of radioactivity with the highest concentration in the lung, liver and kidney. There was no evidence of a specific retention in any organ or tissue.",

The pharmacokinetics of [(14)C]difluoromethane (10,000 to 50,000 ppm/6 hr) revealed that about 2.1% of the inhaled HFC32 was absorbed and that steady state blood levels were achieved within 2 hr and were proportional to dose. Carbon dioxide was the major metabolite of HFC32 at all exposure levels. Carbon monoxide was not detected. The in vivo data were used to validate a PB-PK model to describe the uptake and metabolism of HFC32. Absorption and distribution are adequately described using rat blood:air and tissue:air partition coefficients. Metabolism, which was linear across the dose range, was described by a first order rate constant (Kf = 8.98 hr-1). Of the absorbed HFC32, about 63% was metabolized at all doses; however, when metabolism was expressed as a percentage of the inhaled dose it was much lower, being about 1.4% of the HFC32 entering the airways. ... /rat, rabbit/",

The metabolism and disposition of [(14)C]-difluoromethane ([(14)C]-HFC32) was determined in male Swiss mice as a consequence of a single 6 hr inhalation exposure to atmospheres of 10 000 ppm. Of the inhaled dose, about 1-2% was recovered in expired air, urine, feces and carcass suggesting that systemic absorption of this hydrofluorocarbon from the alveolar air space of the lung into blood is poor. Upon cessation of exposure the majority of the systemically absorbed HFC32 was exhaled within 1 hr. Carbon dioxide was a major metabolite of HFC32. Carbon dioxide measured post-exposure accounted for about 0.3% of the inhaled dose. Urinary and fecal excretion of non-volatile metabolites accounted for about 0.34% and 0.07% of the inhaled dose, respectively. Carbon monoxide could not be detected. Total metabolism, measured as the sum of the radioactivity recovered in urine, feces, as carbon dioxide and that retained in the carcass, amounted to about 0.8% of the inhaled dose, equivalent to 64% of the total radioactivity recovered. Analysis of a range of tissues at 4 days post-exposure showed a relatively uniform distribution of radioactivity with the highest concentration in the lung, liver and kidney. There was no evidence of a specific retention in any organ or tissue.",

Both liquid-phase halogen exchange in the presence of catalysts, such as antimony(V) or tin(IV) chlorofluorides and vapor phase reactions using solid-phase catalysts based on chromium are employed. Preferred starting materials are chloroform for HFC 23, dichloromethane for HFC 32, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane for HFC 143a. The conversion of tetrachloroethylene to HFC 125 and trichloroethylene to HFC 134a involves initial HF-addition across the double bond followed by a series of chlorine-fluorine exchange reactions.",

Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. CAUTION: For LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972), DO NOT apply water, regular or alcohol-resistant foam directly on spill. Use a high-expansion foam if available to reduce vapors. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed.

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 12,600 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates difluoromethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase difluoromethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 years. Atmospheric life-times for difluoromethane have been reported as 5.28-7.3 years. Difluoromethane has estimated 20-, 100- and 500-year Global Warming Potentials of 1800-2920, 550-889 and 180-276, respectively. Difluoromethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, difluoromethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 22. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.29 atm-cu m/mole. Difluoromethane will volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Difluoromethane, present at 3.38 mg/L, reached 8% of its Theoretical oxygen demand in 28 days using an activated sludge inoculum in the OECD 301D screening test, indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, difluoromethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to difluoromethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where difluoromethane is produced or used. With increasing emissions of difluoromethane, the general population may be exposed via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Gas-phase difluoromethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 years(SRC), calculated from the preferred rate constant value of 1.1X10-14 cu cm/molecule-sec(3). The reaction of difluoromethane with hydroxyl radicals will form carbonyl difluoride(4). Atmospheric life-times for difluoromethane have been reported as 5.28-7.3 years(4-8). Difluoromethane has estimated 20-, 100- and 500-year Global Warming Potentials of 1800-2920, 550-889 and 180-276, respectively(4-7). Difluoromethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(9) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

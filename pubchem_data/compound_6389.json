When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Total expired gases were collected during fluorocarbon exposure and afterward until no radioactivity was detectable. Expired (14)CO2 and (14)C-fluorocarbon were assayed. Urine was collected for 72 hours and assayed for nonvolatile radioactivity. Total recoveries of FC-11 were 99.5 and 79.4 per cent in the woman and the man, respectively. Total recoveries of FC-12 were 95.4 and 103.2 per cent. Traces of radioactivity were found in urine (FC-11, 0.07 and 0.09 per cent; FC-12, 0.02 and 0.03 per cent) and in exhaled carbon dioxide (FC-11, 0.13 and 0.10 per cent; FC-12, 0.08 per cent in both subjects).

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /Chlorofluorocarbons and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons/",

The PEL can be given in three ways. [1] Time-weighted average (PEL-TWA): average exposure based on an 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Short-term exposure limit (PEL-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday. [3] Ceiling limit (PEL-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.",

                                "Description": "The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical is an airborne concentration at which a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effect.  There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The original Montreal Protocol was agreed on 16 September 1987 and entered into force on 1 January 1989. The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Trichloromonofluoromethane is found on List D. Case No: 4042; Pesticide type: insecticide; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): Trichloromonofluoromethane; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin & countershock may be effective. Cryogenic dermal injuries should be treated by water bath rewarming at 40-42 \u00b0C until vasodilatory flush has returned. Elevation of the limb & standard frostbite management with late surgical debridement should be utilized. Ocular exposure requires irrigation & slit lamp evaluation for injury. /Freons/",

Forced expiratory volume, a measure of bronchial tone, was measured in 18 children with a history of asthma, before and after inhaling aerosols of the B2-receptor agonist, fenoterol, or a mixture of CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-114, and in the absence of treatment. The levels of exposure were not reported. Exposure to the chlorofluorocarbon mixture significantly reduced forced expiratory volume for 2 hr, relative to no treatment, and for 8 hr relative to exposure to fenoterol (containing CFC-11 and CFC-12). The results suggest that chlorofluorcarbons can decrease bronchial tone in asthmatic patients, but that this effect is transient and of a sufficiently small magnitude to be superseded by the dilating effects of fenoterol when both fenoterol and chlorofluorcarbon propellants are inhaled together.",

The refrigerants used were mainly CFC-12 (in 56% of the cases) and HCFC-22 (32%), the rest being CFC-11, CFC-500 (a mixture of CFC-12 and HCFC 152a), CFC-502 ( a mixture of CFC-115 and HCFC 22). The mean exposure time was 10 min. Chlorofluorocarbon concentrations in the breathing zone were measured for each person individually. The levels exceeded 750 ppm at least once (as one min mean values) for 60 of the 89 individuals. Cardiac arrhythmias were registered before, during, and after the exposure by means of a portable ECG instrument connected to a tape recorder. No statistically significant difference was found between exposed and nonexposed period, nor was there any dose related trend for different individuals when grouped into different exposure groups. In this study, possible effects on the central nervous system were also studied by means of simple reaction time measurements before and after the exposure. No impairment was seen.",

The bioassay of technical grade trichlorofluoromethane for possible carcinogenicity was conducted using Osborne-Mendel rats and B6C3F1 mice. /The cmpd/ in corn oil was admin by gavage, at either of two dosages, to groups of 50 male and 50 female animals of each species, 5 days/wk, over a period of 78 wk. The time weighted avg high and low dosages of trichlorofluoromethane in the chronic bioassay were, respectively 977 and 488 mg/kg for male rats, 1,077 and 538 mg/kg/day for female rats, and 3,925 and 1,962 mg/kg/day for mice of both sexes. After a 78 wk dosing period, rats were observed for an additional period of up to 33 wk and mice were observed for an additional period of up to 13 wk, For each species, 20 animals of each sex were placed on test as vehicle controls. These animals were gavaged with corn oil at the same time dosed animals were gavaged /with the cmpd/. Twenty animals of each sex were placed on test as untreated controls for each species. These animals were not gavaged. A high rate of early deaths occurred among male and female rats in this bioassay. An insufficient number of rats of either sex survived long enough to be at risk from late developing tumors. Survival of mice was adequate for meaningful statistical analysis of late developing tumors. ... The results of the bioassay of trichlorofluoromethane in Osborne-Mendel rats for possible carcinogenicity are not conclusive because of inadequate numbers of rats survived sufficiently long enough to be at risk from late developing tumors. Under the conditions of this bioassay, trichlorofluoromethane was not carcinogenic to male or female B6C3F1 mice.

Aerosol propellant use was banned in the US on December 15, 1978. Trichlorofluoromethane has been identified in emissions from volcanoes. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 803 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates trichlorofluoromethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Trichlorofluoromethane is very stable in the troposphere having a half-life of 52-207 yrs. As a result of its stability, trichlorofluoromethane is transported long distances and its concentration is fairly uniform around the globe away from known sources. Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine. These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer. If released to soil, trichlorofluoromethane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 16. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.70X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Trichlorofluoromethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation in soil and water is not expected under aerobic conditions, but may proceed slowly under anaerobic conditions. If released into water, trichlorofluoromethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 4.6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 22 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since the rate of chlorodifluoromethane hydrolysis is very low, <0.005 g/L-yr at 30 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to trichlorofluoromethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where trichlorofluoromethane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may have been exposed to trichlorofluoromethane via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing trichlorofluoromethane.

Trichlorofluoromethane was released as emissions or in wastewater during its production, storage, transport and use as a foaming agent for polyurethane foams, degreaser and solvent, especially in the aerospace and electronics industries, and as a fire extinguishing agent(3-5). In the early 1970's the largest release of trichlorofluoromethane was from aerosols (75%) with refrigerants and foaming agent use coming next by contributing 14 and 21%, respectively(5). Because its release into the atmosphere was believed to cause depletion of the ozone layer, production was curtailed, from a maximum of 1.58X10+5 metric tons in 1974(5), and declining through 1982(5-10). Production of trichlorofluoromethane-containing propellants was banned after Dec 15, 1978 in the USA(5).",

Trichlorofluoromethane is very stable in the troposphere having a half-life of 52-207 years(3,4). Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine. These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer(5). In the stratosphere this compound will slowly photolyze to release chlorine atoms which in turn participates in the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone(6); the ozone depletion potential for trichloroflouromethane is 1.0(7).",

In anaerobic microcosms using different types of organic waste and anaerobic digested sludge as inoculum, 590 ug/L of trichlorofluoromethane was degraded to less than 5 ug/L within 15 to 20 days(2). Trichlorofluoromethane, present at 8 mg/cu m, degraded to approximately 0.7 mg/cu m in 100 days using a lab-scale anaerobic digester and municipal solid waste inoculum from Hamburg, Germany(3). Trace amounts were still detected at 340 days(3). Samples of anaerobic peat soil from a conifer swamp and a temperate bog in New York were shown to have the capacity to serve as a sink for atmospheric trichlorfluoromethane(4). Headspace concentrations decreased by 34% in 7 days, and by 70% in 10 days in swamp peat and bog peat, respectively(4). Samples from the subsurface anoxic zones of the Black Sea and from Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, Canada showed a depletion of dissolved trichlorofluoromethane, with the removal rate ranging from 0.26-0.48/yr(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 88 years an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). Trichlorofluoromethane does not absorb UV radiation >290 nm(3) nor does it react appreciably with reactive atmospheric species such as hydroxyl radicals or singlet oxygen atoms(4). The compound does not degrade under photochemical smog conditions(5). Estimates of tropospheric half-lives based on time series concentration measurements, etc. range from 52-207 yrs(6,7). Photochemical decomposition of trichlorofluoromethane irradiated with UV light (>300 nm) from a high pressure mercury lamp resulted in mineralization products CO2, CO and HCl(8). Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen(10). In the stratosphere this compound will slowly photolyze to release chlorine atoms(8,10) which in turn participates in the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone(11); the ozone depletion potential for trichloroflouromethane is 1.0(12). Heterogeneous photolysis occurs when trichlorofluoromethane is adsorbed on silica gel with 23% degradation occurring in 170 hr when exposed to sunlight(8), however it is difficult to assess the effect this has on the lifetime. The rate of chlorodifluoromethane hydrolysis is very low, <0.005 g/L-yr at 30 \u00b0C, and is not expected to be an important degradation pathway in the environment, however the rate is greatly affected by the presence of metals such as steel which act as catalysts(9).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

A mean concentration of 0.5 ug/cu m was measured for trichlorofluoromethane in 32 12-hour ambient air samples collected during August to December 2000 from various locations in Perth, Western Australia(2). During a 16-month (July 1996-October 1997) recording period of atmospheric concentrations of trichlorofluoromethane measured in Palisades, NY, mean concentrations ranged from 281.9 to 300.0 ng/cu m(3). Trichlorofluoromethane was detected in ambient air samples at mean concentrations of 1.6, 1.6, and 1.5 ug/cu m, during 24-hour, 7-day, and 4-week sampling periods, respectively, in February 1999 in Chiba City, Japan(4). In the US, 903 samples contained 100-4900 parts/trillion trichlorofluoromethane with a median concentration of 380 parts/trillion(5). Mean concentrations in the US were as follows (ppb, location, date): 0.025, Seagirt, NJ, 6/74; 1.44, New York, NY, 6/74; 0.28, Sandy Hook, NJ 7/74; 0.13, Delaware City, DE, 7/74; 0.24, Baltimore, MD, 7/74; 0.14, Wilmington, OH, 7/74; and 1.34, Bayonne, NJ, 3/73-12/73(6). In Tubingen and Leipzig in Germany, median levels were elevated by approximately 50% compared to background levels; a maximum concentration of 100 ug/cu m was detected in Tubingen(7). Using national and United Nations statistics for 1986, it was determined that almost 75% of the total CFC emissions come from developed countries(8). Monitoring evidence suggests that trichlorofluoromethane emissions in Europe have declined to about one third of the 1987 levels to the end of 1990(9).",

For the US (1977-1980, 431 samples) results indicated a 120 parts/trillion median, 230 parts/trillion maximum concentration(2); South Pole (1975-1980) 90-166 parts/trillion, average annual concentration increase 8-12%(3); US Pacific NW (1975-1980) 125-188 parts/trillion, average annual concentration increase 8-12%(3); Harwell England (1/78-6/81) 207-272 parts/trillion monthly average, annual rate of increase between 1975-1981 10-11 parts/trillion rate of increase slowing down(4); Southern Hemisphere Background: 182 parts/trillion average in 1981 with an annual growth 11.5 parts/trillion for 1979-1981 as measured at Cape Point, South Africa(5) and 130 parts/trillion in June 1977 with an increase of nearly 20% in the previous 12 months as measured at Cape Grim, Australia(6). For Point Barrows, Alaska, trichlorofluoromethane was reported at 192.3-202.6 parts/trillion with the highest concentration during the winter(7). The source of the trichlorofluoromethane is anthropogenic in the mid-latitudes(7). Concentration measurements as a function of latitude show that the concentration decreases with altitude in the troposphere followed by a sharper decrease through the tropopause and into the stratosphere(8). Mean concentration in troposphere over Southern France, June-Sept 1977, 130 parts/trillion(9). Concentrations at three altitudes over Pacific Ocean, Hawaii to Alaska, Oct-Nov 1974, 6 locations (km altitude, range parts/trillion) were as follows: 15.2, 65-106; 18.3, 29-96; 21.3, 5.5-86(10). Concentrations in the Northern stratosphere, sampled April 1974 - Nov 1976 were: 49-90 parts/trillion, 65.3 average; upper troposphere, May-Nov 1976, 115-126 parts/trillion, 122 average(11). A tropospheric concentration range of 127-149 parts/trillion, May 1975 - April 1977, from 4 samples sites between California and Alaska was reported(12). Trichlorofluoromethane was detected, not quantified at Point Barrow, Alaska, showing seasonal variations that parallel that of Arctic haze(13). Samples from ground-level atmosphere in Antartica contained average concentrations of 254 and 269 parts/trillion volume, sampled during Austral summer 1989/90 and 1990/91, respectively(14). Trichlorofluoromethane levels at Caparica, Portugal on the Atlantic coast are approximately 20% lower than at 3 remote forest areas in Germany, Berchtesgaden, Erzgeirge, and Freudenstadt(15). The mean concentration at Whiteface Mountain, New York was 0.13 ppb, sampled from Sept 16 through Sept 19, 1974(16).",

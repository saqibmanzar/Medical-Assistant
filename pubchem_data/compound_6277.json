It may also be found as the tetrahydrate. Cobalt is a metallic element with the atomic number 27. It is found naturally in rocks, soil, water, plants, and animals. In small amounts cobalt is an essential element for life, as it is part of vitamin B12. However, excess exposure is known to exhibit toxic effects. (L29, L30)",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

DNA strand breaks accumulated and repair was inhibited in irradiated HeLa cells exposed to cobaltous acetate. ANIMAL STUDIES: Following administration to rats by gastric intubation acute effects included sedation, diarrhea, and decreased body temperature. Gross pathology exam revealed hemorrhages and dystrophic changes in the liver, kidney, and heart. Oral exposure in rats led to increase in the hemoglobin and hematocrit as well as in the plasma proteins. There was significant hyperglycemia and also significant changes in the lipid parameters such as triglycerides and cholesterol. The neurological signs were observed in rats after acute cobaltous acetate intoxication under mild ischemic conditions. It was not reported to be teratogenic in hamsters or rats. Oxidative DNA base damage has been described.",

It produces oxygen radicals and may be oxidized to ionic cobalt, causing increased lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and inducing certain enzymes that lead to cell apoptosis. Cobalt has also been shown to block inorganic calcium channels, possibly impairing neurotransmission. Cobalt can also chelate lipoic acids, impairing oxidation of pyruvate or fatty acids. In addition, cobalt may inhibit DNA repair by interacting with zinc finger DNA repair proteins, and has also been shown to inhibit heme synthesis and glucose metabolism. Cobalt may activate specific helper T-lymphocyte cells and interact directly with immunologic proteins, such as antibodies (IgA and IgE) or Fc receptors, resulting in immunosensitization. (L29)",

Although available for use in animal feed supplements, cobaltous acetate is prohibited from direct addition or use in human feeds(2); cobaltous acetate is permitted for indirect food contact applications including adhesives for use in packaging, transporting, or holding food and as a components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods(2). Former use as a foam stabilizer in malt beverages is now prohibited(2) which eliminates human exposure through ingestion of treated beverages(SRC).

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this musty-smelling liquid may occur from its use as an intermediate in the production of chloroform and hexafluoroacetone. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, and irritation of the mucous membranes. If contact should occur, immediately flush affected eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, and wash skin with soap and water. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. While hexachloroacetone does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of irritating and poisonous gases. Also, heating of this substance may give rise to toxic thermal decomposition products such as chlorine or phosgene. Fires involving hexachloroacetone may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, fog, or standard foam. Hexachloroacetone should be stored in well-ventilated areas, away from heat and sources of ignition. Containers for international shipment by air and by water must bear the labels, \"Keep away from food\" and \"Poison\", respectively. Small spills of hexachloroacetone may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. Before implementing land disposal of waste hexachloroacetone, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Ketones are incompatible with isocyanates, aldehydes, cyanides, peroxides, and anhydrides. They react violently with aldehydes, HNO3, HNO3 + H2O2, and HClO4.",

The dose range-finding study was conducted at concns of 0, 39, 156, 625, & 2,500 ppm of HCA in the drinking water for 2 wks. However, the 2,500 ppm animals were euthanized on /study day/ 9 as a result of extreme decreases in body weight, & feed & water consumption. Based on decreased body weight & water consumption in the 625 ppm males & females, the dose levels of 0, 25, 100, & 400 ppm were selected for the main study, which utilized one group of male rats (10/dose level) & 2 groups of female rats designated as Group A (peri-conception exposure, 10/dose level) & Group B (gestational exposure, 13/dose level). Control animals received deionized water, the vehicle. During the treatment period, all animals survived to the scheduled necropsy & there were no clinical signs of general toxicity noted at any dose level. At most intervals during the study, water consumption was decreased in all of the 400 ppm animals by 21-51%. The 25 ppm males water consumption was decreased on /study day/ 8 & 33 by 14-25%, while the 100 ppm males consumption was decreased on /study day/ 21-33 by 15-24%. The overall calculated consumption of HCA for Groups 2-4 was 2.8, 10.8, & 32.2 mg/kg/day, respectively. Male & female mean absolute body weights, feed consumption, clinical observations, & gross findings were comparable across dose groups. Female & male reproductive findings were also comparable with the exception of a 16% decr in the number of corpora lutea in the 400 ppm Group A females, a 32% incr in the number of live male pups in the 400 ppm Group B females, & an incr of 25%, 27%, & 29% in the circular sperm, circular over all sperm, & circular over motile sperm, respectively, in the 400 ppm male computer-assisted sperm analysis. The 16% decr in 400 ppm number of corpora lutea was accompanied by a decr (p>0.05) in pre-implantation loss (33%). These findings may suggest that hexachloroacetone may inhibit ovulation, but due to the limited number of females, this result requires replication before being relied on, & furthermore, there is effectively no change in the Group A or B female litter size. Although there was an incr of 32% in the Group B live male pups, the proportion of males/total pups (0.54) is not statistically significant & is well within historical control data (0.42 - 0.61)... . Computer-assisted sperm analysis in the 400 ppm males revealed an incr of 25-29% in circular sperm, % circular over all sperm, & % circular over motile sperm, but with the lack of other male reproductive findings & lack of literature on these parameters, the real meaning of this effect is undetermined. Male organ weights, organ-to-body weight ratios, & clinical chemistry & hematology endpoints were also unaffected by HCA treatment. Results of this study indicate that HCA treatment reduced water consumption in the 400 ppm dose levels in males & females without affecting reproductive function. A max tolerated dose in both males & females was achieved at 400 ppm HCA based on a >20% reduction in water consumption. From these data, HCA may be taste-aversive at 400 ppm in male & female rats & is not a reproductive toxicant in males; however, HCA is a reproductive toxicant in females at a dose level of 400 ppm when rats are exposed to HCA for < or =35 days.",

It can artificially be released to the environment through its application as a weedkiller or through chlorination processes involved in sewage treatment and pulp mill effluents. If released to water, hexachloroacetone is expected to evaporate into the atmosphere with a volatilization half-life of 6.5 hours from a model river. In water, some hexachloroacetone is expected to partition to sediment. In soil, hexachloroacetone should evaporate from dry soil surfaces, but its high Koc value suggests low soil mobility. In the ambient atmosphere, hexachloroacetone is not expected to react with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. There are no data which suggest that the general population is exposed to hexachloroacetone, but workers involved in the previous application of hexachloroacetone as a weedkiller were probably exposed through inhalation or through dermal contact.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on a vapor pressure of 0.376 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C(1) and a water solubility of 154.7 mg/L(2), the Henry's Law constant is estimated to be 8.33X10-4 atm cu-m/mole at 25 \u00b0C(SRC). This value of Henry's Law constant suggests that hexachloroacetone will volatilize significantly, but not rapidly from water. Based on this value, the volatilization half-life of hexachloroacetone from a model river 1 m deep flowing 1 m/sec with a wind velocity of 3 m/sec has been estimated to be approximately 6.5 hours(3,SRC).",

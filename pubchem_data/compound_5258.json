Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Both sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol are highly protein bound and therefore unlikely to enter milk in clinically important amounts. If sodium phenylbutyrate with or without taurursodiol is required by the mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. Until more data become available, these products should be used with caution during breastfeeding, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. Monitoring the breastfed infant for neurotoxicity (excessive sedation, vomiting) during maternal therapy may be advisable.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

To evaluate novel upstream pathways that regulate placental sFlt1 production, we screened a library of natural compounds (n=502) in human placental cell lines. Here, we report 3 compounds in the cardiac glycoside family, ouabain, gitoxigenin, and digitoxin, that inhibit placental sFlt1 production at nanomolar concentrations in vitro. We further characterized ouabain and demonstrated that it inhibits sFlt1 mRNA and protein expression in human placental cytotrophoblasts and explant cultures in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Ouabain down-regulated sFlt1 production by inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1alpha) protein expression in the placenta. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27) was necessary for ouabain to inhibit HIF-1alpha translation. In a rat model of pregnancy-induced hypertension, ouabain reduced mean arterial pressure and enhanced placental HSP27 phosphorylation without any adverse effects on pups ...",

The levels of integrin proteins in response to ouabain were determined by western blotting. Anchorage-independent growth and migration behaviors were performed by the wound healing assay and colony formation assay, respectively. Herein, the results suggested that exposure of the lung cancer cells to physiological concentrations of ouabain significantly altered the level of integrins. Ouabain suppressed integrin alpha-4, alpha-5, alpha-v, beta-3 and beta-4, whereas it had no significant effect on integrin beta-1 and beta-4. According to the switch patterns of integrins, ouabain treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction of cell colony size and inhibition of cancer cell migration. However, ouabain-induced integrin switch had only a slight effect on chemotherapeutic drug susceptibility. Ouabain may have a role in suppressing cancer metastasis via integrin regulation.",

In addition, plasma ouabain is increased in several hypertension models, and the acute or chronic administration of ouabain increases blood pressure in rodents. These results suggest a possible association between ouabain and the genesis or development and maintenance of arterial hypertension. One explanation for this association is that ouabain binds to the alpha-subunit of the Na(+) pump, inhibiting its activity. Inhibition of this pump increases intracellular Na(+), which reduces the activity of the sarcolemmal Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger and thereby reduces Ca(2+) extrusion. Consequently, intracellular Ca(2+) increases and is taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which, upon activation, releases more calcium and increases the vascular smooth muscle tone. In fact, acute treatment with ouabain enhances the vascular reactivity to vasopressor agents, increases the release of norepinephrine from the perivascular adrenergic nerve endings and promotes increases in the activity of endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme and the local synthesis of angiotensin II in the tail vascular bed. Additionally, the hypertension induced by ouabain has been associated with central mechanisms that increase sympathetic tone, subsequent to the activation of the cerebral renin-angiotensin system. Thus, the association with peripheral mechanisms and central mechanisms, mainly involving the renin-angiotensin system, may contribute to the acute effects of ouabain-induced elevation of arterial blood pressure.",

Ouabain, an endogenous cardiac glycoside produced by the adrenal gland, has been previously reported to have anti-tumor activities; however, its role in the regulation of cancer cell migration remains unknown. The present study has revealed that treatment with ouabain at physiological concentrations is able to inhibit the migratory activities of human lung cancer H292 cells. The negative effects of ouabain were found to be mediated through the suppression of migration regulatory proteins, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (Akt), and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42). We found that the observed actions of ouabain were mediated via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism because the addition of ROS scavengers (N-acetylcysteine and glutathione) could reverse the effect of ouabain on cell migration. Furthermore, ouabain was shown to inhibit the spheroidal tumor growth and decrease the cancer cell adhesion to endothelial cells. However, the compound had no significant effect on anoikis of the cells. ...",

Here, we have demonstrated that incubation of HeLa cells during 24 hr with nanomolar concentrations of ouabain or digoxin causes apoptotic death of 30-50% of the cells. Ouabain caused the activation of caspases-3/7 and -9; however, caspase-8 was unaffected. The fact that compound Z-LEHD-FMK reduced both apoptosis and caspase-9 activation elicited by ouabain, suggest a mitochondrially-mediated pathway. This was strengthened by the fact that ouabain caused ATP depletion and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol. Furthermore, upon ouabain treatment mitochondrial disruption and redistribution into the cytosol were observed. A mitochondrial site of action for ouabain was further corroborated by tight co-localization of fluorescent ouabain with mitochondria. Finally, in ouabain-treated cells the histamine-elicited elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]c) suggests an additional effect on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leading to Ca(2+) store depletion. We conclude that fluorescent ouabain is taken up and tightly co-localizes with mitochondria of HeLa cells. This indicates that apoptosis may be triggered by a direct action of ouabain on mitochondria.",

Recently, ouabain was shown to affect various immunological processes. We have previously demonstrated the ability of ouabain to modulate inflammation, but little is known about the mechanisms involved. Thus, the aim of the present work is to evaluate the immune modulatory role of ouabain on zymosan-induced peritonitis in mice. Our results show that ouabain decreased plasma exudation (33%). After induction of inflammation, OUA treatment led to a 46% reduction in the total number of cells, as a reflex of a decrease of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which does not appear to be due to cell death. Furthermore, OUA decreased TNF-alpha (57%) and IL-1beta (58%) levels, without interfering with IL-6 and IL-10. Also, in vitro experiments show that ouabain did not affect endocytic capacity. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) shows that zymosan treatment increased (85%) NF-kappaB binding activity and that ouabain reduced (30%) NF-kappaB binding activity induced by zymosan. Therefore, our data suggest that ouabain modulated acute inflammatory response, reducing the number of cells and cytokines levels in the peritoneal cavity, as well as NFkappaB activation, suggesting a new mode of action of this substance.",

It has been  used as medication and as a veterinary drug. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Ouabain-induced reactive oxygen species generation and cell apoptosis on human glioma cells has been described. The number of ouabain binding sites, detected using (3)H ouabain, were significantly increased in the borderline hypertensive subjects irrespective of heredity. Endogenous ouabain levels increase in human essential hypertension. ANIMAL STUDIES: Retinal activity measured by electroretinography in animals and in isolated retinas has been shown to be rapidly reduced by exposure to ouabain. Intravitreal injection in rabbits has caused rapid loss of vision. In cats circumferential artery of iris is reported to be constricted by ouabain. Ouabain is an endogenous Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor whose chronic administration induces hypertension. Ouabain treatment in rats produced cognitive deficits independent of locomotor effects associated with bipolar disorder. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Ouabain inhibited the efflux of ammonia (from the basolateral to the apical side) in preparation of isolated Carcinus gills.",

Bipolar mania has been known to be associated with dysfunctions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain area critically involved in mental functions; however, the exact mechanism underlying these dysfunctions is not yet clear. The present study investigated synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and dopamine release in Sprague-Dawley rat mPFC following ICV administration of ouabain (5 uL of 1 mM ouabain). The electrophysiological results demonstrated that ouabain depressed the short- and the long-term synaptic plasticity, represented by paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation, respectively, in the mPFC. These ouabain-induced alterations in synaptic plasticity can be prevented by pre-treatment with lithium (intraperitoneal injection of 47.5 mg/kg lithium, twice a day, 7 days), which acts as an effective mood stabilizer in preventing mania. The electrochemical results demonstrated that ICV administration of ouabain enhanced dopamine release in the mPFC, which was not affected by pre-treatment with lithium. These findings suggested that alterations in synaptic plasticity and dopamine release in the mPFC might underlie the dysfunctions of mPFC accompanied with ouabain administration-induced bipolar mania.",

Most biological effects of BDNF are mediated by the activation of TrkB receptors. This neurotrophin regulates several neuronal functions as cell proliferation, viability, and differentiation. Ouabain is a steroid that binds to the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, inducing the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways. Previous data from our group described that ouabain treatment increases retinal ganglion cells survival (RGC). The aim of the present study was to evaluate, if this cardiac glycoside can have a synergistic effect with BDNF, the classical trophic factor for retinal ganglion cells, as well as investigate the intracellular signaling pathways involved. Our work demonstrated that the activation of Src, PLC, and PKCdelta participates in the signaling cascade mediated by 50 ng/mL BDNF, since their selective inhibitors completely blocked the trophic effect of BDNF. We also demonstrated a synergistic effect on RGC survival when we concomitantly used ouabain (0.75 nM) and BDNF (10 ng/mL). Moreover, the signaling pathways involved in this synergistic effect include Src, PLC, PKCdelta, and JNK. Our results suggest that the synergism between ouabain and BDNF occurs through the activation of the Src pathway, JNK, PLC, and PKCdelta.",

Wistar rats received Li, VPA, or saline twice a day for 13 days. On the 7th day of treatment, the animals received a single intracerebroventricular injection of ouabain or aCSF. After the ICV injection, the treatment with mood stabilizers continued for 6 additional days. The locomotor activity of rats was measured using the open-field test. In addition, we analyzed oxidative stress parameters, specifically levels of phosphorylated p53 (pp53), BAX and Bcl-2 in the brain of rats by immunoblot. Li and VPA reversed ouabain-related hyperactivity. Ouabain decreased Bcl-2 levels and increased the oxidative stress parameters BAX and pp53 in the brains of rats. Li and VPA improved these ouabain-induced cellular dysfunctions; however, the effects of the mood stabilizers were dependent on the protein and brain region analyzed. These findings suggest that the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase can be an important link between oxidative damage and the consequent reduction of neuronal and glial density, which are both observed in BD, and that Li and VPA exert protective effects against ouabain-induced activation of the apoptosis pathway.",

We investigated whether DHA-enriched avian glycerophospholipids (GPL-DHA) exert cardioprotection in ouabain-treated rats after 4 weeks of dietary supplementation with 10, 35 or 60 mg DHA per kg body weight versus none (DHA10, DHA35, DHA60 and control groups, respectively). The contractile responsiveness to different doses of ouabain (10(-7) to 10(-4) M), ouabain intoxication (at 3 X 10(-4) M), and relative variations in cardiac energy metabolism were determined using (31)P NMR in isolated perfused rat hearts. The fatty acid composition of cardiac membranes was analyzed by gas chromatography. DHA accretion in the heart was dose-dependent (+8%, +30% and +45% for DHA10, DHA35 and DHA60, respectively). The cardiac phosphocreatine content significantly increased at the baseline in DHA35 (+45%) and DHA60 groups (+85%), and at the different doses of ouabain in the DHA60 group (+73% to 98%). The maximum positive inotropy achieved at 10(-4) M ouabain was significantly increased in all DHA groups versus control (+150%, +122.5% and +135% for DHA10, DHA35 and DHA60, respectively), and ouabain intoxication was delayed. The increase in myocardial phosphocreatine content and the improved efficacy of ouabain on myocardial contraction without toxicity suggest the potential of GPL-DHA as a dietary supplement or ingredient for functional food, and possibly as a co-treatment with digitalis drugs in humans.",

The medical pretreatment of the various donor patients was similar but differed with regard to the duration of preoperative digitalization ranging from several days to months. Whereas the maximal contraction induced by noradrenaline was not influenced by prior digitalization, the contracture evoked by ouabain showed a strong dependency on the duration of preoperative digitalization. In patients without or with only short-term preoperative digitalization the spasm exerted by ouabain amounted to 48.8% and 49.2%, respectively, of the maximal contraction induced by noradrenaline, and decreased to zero in patients with long-term digitalization. From this result it is concluded that, in patients after coronary artery bypass grafting who did not receive cardiac glycosides for long-term treatment, the acute administration of glycosides may be a mechanism responsible for the early occlusion of saphenous vein bypass grafts.",

Here, we have demonstrated that incubation of HeLa cells during 24 hr with nanomolar concentrations of ouabain or digoxin causes apoptotic death of 30-50% of the cells. Ouabain caused the activation of caspases-3/7 and -9; however, caspase-8 was unaffected. The fact that compound Z-LEHD-FMK reduced both apoptosis and caspase-9 activation elicited by ouabain, suggest a mitochondrially-mediated pathway. This was strengthened by the fact that ouabain caused ATP depletion and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol. Furthermore, upon ouabain treatment mitochondrial disruption and redistribution into the cytosol were observed. A mitochondrial site of action for ouabain was further corroborated by tight co-localization of fluorescent ouabain with mitochondria. Finally, in ouabain-treated cells the histamine-elicited elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]c) suggests an additional effect on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leading to Ca(2+) store depletion. We conclude that fluorescent ouabain is taken up and tightly co-localizes with mitochondria of HeLa cells. This indicates that apoptosis may be triggered by a direct action of ouabain on mitochondria.",

Herein, we demonstrate that sub-toxic concentrations of ouabain facilitate cancer cell detachment from the extracellular matrix in human lung cancer cells. Ouabain at concentrations of 0-10 pM significantly enhanced cell detachment in dose- and time- dependent manners, while having minimal effect on cell viability. The detachment-inducing effect of ouabain was found to be mediated through focal-adhesion kinase and ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase pathways. Alpha-5 and beta-1 integrins were found to be down-regulated in response to ouabain treatment. Since detachment of cancer cells is a prerequisite process for metastasis to begin, these insights benefit our understanding over the molecular basis of cancer biology.",

Retinoic acid (RA) is commonly used to induce neuroblastoma differentiation in cultures. Upon RA administration, human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH demonstrated neurite extensions, which is an indicator of neuronal cell differentiation. Here we report that ouabain-induced signaling is altered under the action of 1 uM RA in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. RA increased the expression of p110alpha subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt and beta1 subunit of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Ouabain activated Akt and ERK 1/2 in differentiated SK-N-SH cells; this effect was not observed in non-differentiated SK-N-SH cells. Long-term incubation of non-differentiated SK-N-SH with 1 uM ouabain led to a decrease in the number of cells; this effect was reduced in differentiated SK-N-SH cells. Taken together, these results suggest that ouabain leads to cell death in neuroblastoma cells rather than neuronal cells due to the different response to ouabain manifested by activation of Akt and ERK 1/2. RA increases the expression of p110alpha subunit of PI3K, Akt and beta1 subunit of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Ouabain induces activation of Akt and ERK 1/2 in differentiated SK-N-SH cells but not in non-differentiated cells. 1 uM ouabain leads to a decrease in the number of cells in non-differentiated SK-N-SH. Reduction of ouabain-induced cell death in differentiated SK-N-SH.",

Guinea pigs of 1-5 days old tolerated 75% more ouabain than the young adults without significant alteration in the maximal inotropic response. Sodium-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake was substantially lower in the vesicles isolated from hearts of 3-day-old animals, which was characterized by a lower rate of 45Ca2+ uptake (60% Vmax), as compared to the young adults. There was no significant difference in the affinity for 45Ca2+ (Km). The apparent rate of Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux was also lower in the vesicles from 3-day-old guinea pigs. However, the percent extrusion of 45Ca2+ appeared to be unchanged.",

The pancreas was hemodynamically isolated in situ and perfused at a constant flow rate with the animal's own blood conducted from the left femoral artery by means of a peristaltic pump. Drugs were introduced into the blood perfusing the pancreas. Secretin (0.03 to 0.3 units) was injected as a bolus; its effects lasted for 15 min. The volume of pancreatic juice excreted during this period was measured and expressed as an incremental output after subtraction of the resting output for 15 min. Then, ouabain was injected 2 min before the injection of a second dose of secretin. The effects of the drugs were then deduced by comparing the secretory response to the second dose of secretin with that to the first. The pancreatic juice secretion rate following secretion injections alone was 11.3 +/- 0.7 uL/min. Ouabain (10 ug) addition to the perfusion circulation inhibited about 36%, 32%, and 32% of control values of pancreatic secretion induced by 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 units of secretin, respectively. A combination of ouabain (10 ug) and acetazolamide (10 mg) inhibited pancreatic secretion more than either drug alone, 54%, 53%, and 46% of control values for the three doses of secretin, respectively. Bicarbonate concentration in pancreatic juice was increased by the ouabain dose (10 ug) from 20 mmol/L in the control to about 70 mmol/L. Chloride concentration was decreased by the ouabain dose from 120 mmol/L in the control to about 75 mmol/L. Sodium and protein concentrations were not altered by drug addition.",

Acute volume expansion resulted in the elevation of blood pressure associated with an increase in cardiac output. In some dogs the blood pressure remained elevated with gradual increase in total peripheral resistance (Group I) or with sustained high cardiac output (Group II), and in other dogs (Group III) it returned to the control level. Ouabain administration elevated the blood pressure and total peripheral resistance in these groups and sham dogs which did not have volume expansion. And these effects of ouabain were not correlated with the degree of blood pressure or vasoconstriction produced by volume expansion. Thus, it is not likely that endogenous Na+-K+-ATPase inhibitors increased to produce vasoconstricted hypertension after acute volume expansion.",

Adding 10(-4) M amiloride to the solution bathing the gill preparations reduces the efflux of ammonia by 29% relative to the control value. Under experimental conditions, it appears that only about 1% of the amiloride-sensitive influx of Na+ (Ja----b) can be exchanged with NH4+ on an equimolar basis. The ammonium ion is apparently transported at the basolateral side by a carrier-mediated process. Kinetic analyses of the influx of ammonium ions revealed a Km of 36.99 uM and a maximum velocity (Vmax) equal to 19.6 umol/g/h. Basolaterally applied ouabain (5 x 10(-3) M) and NaCN (10(-3) M) reduced the efflux of ammonia by 46.7 and 42.2%, respectively, suggesting an interaction of NH4+ with the basolaterally located Na+/K+ exchanger in which NH4+ appears to be able to substitute for K+.",

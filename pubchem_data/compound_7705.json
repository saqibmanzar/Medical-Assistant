PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Male rats were treated with acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl n-propyl ketone, methyl n-butyl ketone, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, or n-butylbenzene. The methyl n-alkyl ketones induced the metabolic activities of hepatic microsomes toward aminopyrine, 7-ethoxycoumarin, and aniline. n-Alkylbenzenes induced aminopyrine and 7-ethoxycoumarin metabolic activities. ...Testosterone 16 beta-hydroxylation activity  was induced by n-alkylbenzenes. These results indicate that the levels of multiple forms of cytochrome P450 were changed by treatment with these chemicals. P450IIE1, an acetone-inducible form, was induced by methyl n-alkyl ketones or n-alkylbenzenes. The inducibility did not depend on the length of the side chain of these chemicals. P450IIB1 and IIB2, both phenobarbital-inducible forms, were induced with methyl n-alkyl ketones and n-alkylbenzenes to an extent depending on the length of the side chain of these chemicals. Thus, the hydrophobicity of the inducer affected phenobarbital-type induction but not the induction of P450IIE1. /The authors/ further investigated the interactions of ketone and benzene derivatives with cytochrome P450 in vitro. Testosterone hydroxylation activities of hepatic microsomes were measured in the presence of methyl n-alkyl ketones and n-alkylbenzenes. Methyl n-alkyl ketones inhibited testosterone 16 beta-hydroxylation activity. n-Alkylbenzenes inhibited 2 beta-, 6 beta-, 15 alpha-, 16 alpha-, and 16 beta-hydroxylation activities. Testosterone hydroxylation activities were inhibited by these chemicals depending on the length of the side chain. n-Alkylbenzenes were stronger inhibitors than methyl n-alkyl ketones, n-Butylbenzene was the strongest inhibitor of these activities. These results indicate that hydrophobicity was important in the interaction of these chemicals with cytochrome P450, and that there is some relationship between the inducibility of cytochrome P450 and its interaction with inducers.",

When phenylbutane (1 ) was incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 hr with S-9, asymmetric oxidation occurred regioselectively at benzylic and omega-1 positions to afford preferentially (R)- and (S)-alcohol (2, 4), respectively. This enzymatic propensity was the case for the production of 1, 3-diols. (1R, 3S)- or (1R, 3R)-Butanediols(3a, 3b) were also obtained at 87% and 27%, respectively. This oxidation was induced by phenobarbital (PB) or beta-napthoflavone(beta-NF), and significant sex-related differences in control and PB pre-treated rats have been observed. Since these oxidations were inhibited with SKF-525A and CO, it was inferred that cytochrome P-450 was responsible for the oxidation.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

We found that hydrocarbons induce ROS formation in a concentration-dependent manner and that the ROS-inducing potency increases with increasing number of carbon atoms in the structure. In general, aromatic hydrocarbons were less potent inducers of ROS than aliphatic and cyclic hydrocarbons. The most potent compound in each group, t-butylcyclohexane, n-decane, and n-butylbenzene, were chosen for mechanistic studies. ROS formation was inhibited by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erbstatin-A, and the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin. The involvement of the ERK1/2 pathway was confirmed by Western blot analysis of phosphorylated ERK1/2. The study revealed only small differences in the mechanisms involved for the three compounds. The responses were not affected by Pertussis toxin, indicating that Gi-protein coupled receptors are not involved in neutrophil activation after hydrocarbon exposure. Based on these findings we propose a mechanism involving tyrosine kinases, PI3 kinase, and the ERK1/2 pathway, leading to activation of the NADPH oxidase and production of ROS in neutrophils stimulated by organic solvents.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.06 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-butylbenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-butylbenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.8 days. n-Butylbenzene does not absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm, and is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, n-butylbenzene is expected to have slight mobility based upon Koc values ranging from 2,450-2,510. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.016 atm-cu m/mole. n-Butylbenzene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. A persistence of 3 months to 1 year in unadapted soils indicates that biodegradation in soil is may not be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, n-butylbenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon n-butylbenzene's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 and 110 hours, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 470 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to n-butylbenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-butylbenzene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-butylbenzene via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(7) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.016 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 1.06 mm Hg(8), and water solubility, 11.8 mg/L(9). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(7), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 and 110 hours, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 16 days if adsorption is considered (10). According to a classification scheme(10), an estimated BCF of 470(SRC), from its log Kow of 4.38(12) and a regression-derived equation(13), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). n-Butylbenzene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(14). Biodegradation data in water were not located(SRC). n-Butylbenzene biodegradation in aquatic systems may be slow based on it being difficult to degrade in unadapted soils(15).",

Vapor-phase n-butylbenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.8 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.7X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). n-Butylbenzene does not absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm(4), and is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that n-butylbenzene is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 3.5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 4.6 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 16 days if adsorption is considered(4). n-Butylbenzene's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of n-butylbenzene from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.06 mm Hg(1). However, volatilization is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to soil(SRC).",

Nine urban studies of shallow groundwater carried out as part of the US Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program; n-butylbenzene was detected in fewer than 5% of the wells(3). Groundwater samples from existing wells at 30 industrial sites in Taiwan (8 chemical and petrochemical industrial districts, 2 technology industrial parks, 11 general industrial districts, 2 metal processing areas, 2 oil refinery plants, 1 pesticide manufacturing plant, and 4 landfills) were monitored for 60 volatile organic chemicals; n-butylbenzene was detected, along with 7 other organic chemicals, with a frequency of approximately 2.5% of 214 samples(4). Ambient groundwater samples were collected as part of the National Water-Quality Assessment Program of the US Geological Service from 2,948 well from around the US in 1985-1995; n-butylbenzene was detected in wells in urban areas (n=406) and rural areas (n=2,542) with a frequency and range of 1.7% and approximately 1-8 ug/L, and 0.1% and approximately 0.3-5 ug/L, respectively(5). Three groundwater samples collected near 2 underground coal gasification sites in northeastern Wyoming were analyzed for dissolved organic contaminates; n-butylbenzene concns ranged from 27-51 ppb(6). n-Butylbenzene was detected at 0.59 ug/L in 1 groundwater sample from the Orange County Landfill in Orlando, FL collected in 1992-1993; it was not detected in 3 other samples at this site(7). n-Butylbenzene was detected at 0.015 mg/L in groundwater samples (15.5 ft below land surface) in 1990 from a site in Galloway Township, NJ where an underground gasoline storage tank leaked(8). Concns of various organic compounds were measured in groundwater at three creosote contaminated sites in Denmark(9). At a former asphalt factory in Ringe, Denmark that operated from 1915 to 1954, n-butylbenzene concns in groundwater were not detected, 12, and 1 ug/L at 0, 25, and 25 meters from the source(9). At Holte Sollerod Gasworks (1907-1963) in Denmark, n-butylbenzene concns were 324, 259, 10 ug/L at 0, 5, and 10 meters from the source(9). At Frederica Gasworks (1866-1966) in Denmark, n-butylbenzene was not detected at the limit of detection 1 ug/L(9).",

Emissions from light-duty vehicle traffic were measured at the Caldecott Tunnel in the San Francisco Bay area during August and October 1994, between these 2 periods the average oxygen content of gasoline sold in this area increased from 0.3 to 2.0% by weight; n-butylbenzene composed 0.66 and 0.55% of the total volatile organic compounds measured during August (low oxygenate) and October (high oxygenate), respectively(5). n-Butylbenzene concns ranged from 0.004 to 0.024 ppb volume in ambient air in the Los Angeles basin(6). According to a national survey of ambient air, which included five site types (remote, rural, suburban, urban, and source dominated) the average daily atmospheric concns of n-butylbenzene was 0.051 ppb volume for 52 samples(7).",

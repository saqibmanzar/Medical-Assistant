When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

TBT /was administered/ to rats and guinea pigs intragastrically at a dose of 100 mg/kg and analyzed metabolites of TBT in glucuronidase-sulfatase-treated urine using gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric methods. In this study, p-tert-butylbenzoic acid and its alcohol derivative, 2-(p-carboxyphenyl)-2-methylpropan-1-ol, were identified as the major (17-22% of dose) urinary metabolites in rats, whereas p-tert-butylbenzoylglycine was found to be the most prominent metabolite (34% of dose) in guinea pigs. Minor metabolites (2-4% of dose) found in rat urine were 2-methyl-2-p-tolyl-propan-1-ol and p-tert-butylbenzoylglycine , while those in the guinea pig were p-tert-butylbenzoic acid, 2-methyl-2-p-tolylpropan-1-ol, and 2-methyl-2-p-tolylpropionic acid which was not detected at all in rats. Trace amounts (<0.5% of dose) of p-tert-butylbenzyl alcohol were found both in rat and guinea pig urine. 2-(p-Carboxyphenyl)-2-methylpropionic acid, a trace amount, was detected only in rat urine. Similar metabolism of TBT was also found when the chemical was given by inhalation. In this case, trace amounts of 2-(p-carboxyphenyl)-2- methylpropan-1-ol, which was not identified after intragastric administration, was detected in the urine of guinea pigs.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to the atmosphere, 4-t-butyltoluene will degrade in the vapor-phase by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of 2.2 days). If released to water, volatilization will be an important process. Volatilization half-lives ranging from 3.6 hours to 13 days can be estimated for an model environmental river and pond. If released to soil, low mobility is expected since 4-t-butyltoluene adsorbs strongly (estimated Koc of 1700-1900). Evaporation from dry surfaces should occur. A single biodegradation screening study suggests that 4-t-butyltoluene does not biodegrade easily. Occupational exposure to 4-t-butyltoluene may occur through dermal contact and inhalation of vapor.

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Name": "MolGenie Organic Chemistry Ontology",
                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

It is a non-sedating, selective antagonist of the histamine 1 (H1) receptor, a mast cell stabilizer, and it suppresses the migration of eosinophils into inflamed tissues to prevent tissue damage and worsening of allergic inflammation of the conjunctiva.

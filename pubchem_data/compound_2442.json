Upon administration, bromhexine increases lysosomal activity and enhances hydrolysis of acid mucopolysaccharide polymers in the respiratory tract. This increases the production of serous mucus in the respiratory tract, which makes the phlegm thinner and decreases mucus viscosity. This contributes to its secretomotoric effect, and allows the cilia to more easily transport the phlegm out of the lungs. This clears mucus from the respiratory tract and may aid in the treatment of respiratory disorders associated with abnormal viscid mucus, excessive mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Mucus clearance is necessary for lung health; bromhexine aids in mucus clearance by reducing the viscosity of mucus and activating the ciliary epithelium, allowing secretions to be expelled from the respiratory tract.  Recent have studies have demonstrated that bromhexine inhibits the transmembrane serine protease 2 receptor (TMPRSS2) in humans. Activation of TMPRSS2 plays an important role in viral respiratory diseases such as influenza A and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Inhibition of receptor activation and viral entry by bromhexine may be effective in preventing or treating various respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. In vitro studies have suggested the action of ambroxol (a metabolite of bromhexine) on the angiogensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2), prevents entry of the viral envelope-anchored spike glycoprotein of SARS-Cov-2 into alveolar cells or increases the secretion of surfactant, preventing viral entry.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat.",

Using an ex vivo gastric chamber model, various concn (l0-80 mg/ml) of the two agents were applied to the gastric mucosa prior to exposure to 40% ethanol. Both agents significantly reduced ethanol induced damage in a dose dependent manner. When given orally (80 mg/kg) both agents significantly reduced gastric damage induced by subsequent oral administration of absolute ethanol. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not significantly affect the protection afforded by FPL-52694, but did cause a partial reversal of the protective effect of sodium cromoglycate. Changes in gastric leukotriene C4 synthesis did not correlate with the protective effects of the two agents. Both mucosal and connective tissue mast cell numbers were significantly reduced following oral ethanol administration. In the groups pretreated with FPL-52694 or sodium cromoglycate, mucosal mast cell numbers were not significantly different from those in rats not treated with ethanol. Furthermore, the connective tissue mast cell numbers were significantly lower than in ethanol treated control rats, despite a greater than 95% reduction of ethanol induced hemorrhagic damage. These results therefore suggest that stimulation of gastric prostaglandin synthesis is not important in the mechanism of action of FPL-52694, and neither agent appears to reduce damage through a mechanism related to effects on gastric leukotriene C4 synthesis. The present studies further suggest that the protection afforded by pretreatment with sodium cromoglycate or FPL-52694 may be unrelated to effects of these agents on the connective tissue mast cell population in the stomach. /Sodium cromoglycate/",

In the asthmatic group histamine inhalation led to a mean 24% reduction in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second but had no effect on the normal subjects. When compared with the inhaled placebo, histamine incr the initial pulmonary absorption of cromolyn without influencing the total amount of drug absorbed in both asthmatics and normals. These observations suggest that the pharmacokinetics of the inhaled drug may be altered significantly by inflammatory mediators present at the site of drug absorption from the airways. /Cromolyn sodium/",

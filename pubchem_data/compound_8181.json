When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Methyl palmitate is found naturally as a flavor component of some foods. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.00006 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl palmitate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl palmitate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 hours. Particulate-phase methyl palmitate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, methyl palmitate is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 18,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.009 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Methyl palmitate is expected to rapidly biodegrade in aerobic soils as suggested by results of screening studies. If released into water, methyl palmitate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Methyl palmitate is expected to rapidly biodegrade in aerobic waters. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 160 hours, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is estimated to be about 60 hours ignoring adsorption; when considering maximum adsorption the volatilization half-life increases to 150 days. An estimated BCF of 620 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. An estimated base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 0.030 L/mole-sec corresponds to half-lives of 7.3 years and 270 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to methyl palmitate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl palmitate is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to methyl palmitate due to its occurrence in some foods. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.009 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 160 hours, respectively(SRC), using an estimation method(3). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is estimated to be about 60 hours ignoring adsorption; when considering maximum adsorption the volatilization half-life increases to 150 days(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 620(SRC) from a log Kow of 7.38(10) regression-derived equation(7) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Methyl palmitate is expected to rapidly biodegrade in aerobic waters(8). An estimated base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 0.030 L/mole-sec(9,SRC) corresponds to half-lives of 7.3 years and 270 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(9).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

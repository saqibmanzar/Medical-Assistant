Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Values for K* decreased with increasing carbon number of alkanals; eg, at 25 \u00b0C apparent partition coefficients between air and seawater range from 3710 for formaldehyde and 13.1 for acetaldehyde to 0.181 for decanal. log K* was found-to be highly temperature dependent, varying linearly with l/T for all compounds studied. The salinity effect on K* increases with increasing molecular weight; K* (seawater)/K*(freshwater) ratios range from close to 1 for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to less than 0.3 for nonanal and decanal. The effect of pH in the range of 4-8 on K* as found to be negligible.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

End products of this phenomenon include low molecular weight, water-soluble aldehydes, compounds that covalently modify proteins and nucleic acids, thereby altering function. Aliphatic aldehydes (C3-C10) are generated during lipid peroxidation, along with alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes, including acrolein and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). The Hantzsch reaction was used to produce heterocyclic aldehyde derivatives that can be conveniently analyzed with mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatographic analyses revealed increasing retention times from derivatized methanal to octanal. HNE derivatives were observed to elute between heptanal and octanal derivatives, while the acrolein derivatives had a retention time similar to the propanal derivative. Smaller aliphatic aldehyde derivatives fragmented in a similar manner to produce a base peak of m/z 273, while the larger derivatives yielded m/z 274 as the base peak. Acrolein and HNE derivatives fragmented in a slightly different manner compared to their aliphatic counterparts. Calibration plots of aliphatic and unsaturated aldehydes were linear (r2 >/= 0.99) in the concentration range explored (approximately 5-1500 pg on column). The LC-MS/MS methodology developed here will be used in subsequent studies to determine aldehyde concentrations for comparing age-matched controls to AD tissues from human subjects.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is employed in the perfume industry for the preparation of synthetic citrus oils and for the synthesis of alpha-hexylcinnamaldehyde. HUMAN STUDIES: In vitro in human A549 cells octanal affects the expression of several chemokines and inflammatory cytokines and increases the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 released. Microarray analysis identified 15 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in octanal-exposed A549 human alveolar cells. ANIMAL STUDIES: It induced a significant decrease in the number of live pups in rats but only at a dose which causes maternal toxicity. Octanal was tested in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 with and without metabolic activation. No cytotoxic or genotoxic effects were observed. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: A membrane damage mechanism involving membrane peroxidation might contribute to the antifungal activity of octanal against P. digitatum spores. Aflatoxin production by the fungus Aspergillus parasiticus was stimulated by octanal.",

When P. expansum spores were inoculated into apple juice broth, some alkenals, including 2-propenal, (E)-2-butenal, (E)-2-pentenal, and (E)-2-hexenal, inhibited fungal growth and patulin production. Their minimal inhibitory concentrations were 5, 50, 80, and 80 ug/mL respectively. Vital staining indicated that these alkenals killed mycelia within 4 hr. Treatment of the spores with these aldehydes also resulted in rapid loss of germination ability, within 0.5-2 d. On the other hand, aliphatic aldehydes with 8-10 carbons significantly enhanced patulin production without affecting fungal growth: 300 ug/mL of octanal and 100 ug/mL of (E)-2-octenal increased the patulin concentrations in the culture broth by as much as 8.6- and 7.8-fold as compared to that of the control culture respectively. The expression of the genes involved in patulin biosynthesis in P. expansum was investigated in mycelia cultured in apple juice broth containing 300 ug/mL of octanal for 3.5, 5, and 7 d. Transcription of the msas gene, encoding 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase, which catalyzed the first step in the patulin biosynthetic pathway was remarkably high in the 3.5-d and 5-d-old cultures as compared with the control. However, octanal did not any increase the transcription of the msas in the 7-d-old culture or that of the other two genes, IDH and the peab1, in culture. Thus the enhanced patulin accumulation with supplementation with these aldehydes is attributable to the increased amount of the msas transcript.",

In this study, we aimed to identify octanal (OC)-sensitive miRNAs and to characterize the relationships between miRNAs and expression of candidate genes involved in OC-induced toxicity. Microarray analysis identified 15 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in OC-exposed A549 human alveolar cells. Integrated analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles identified significant miRNA-mRNA anti-correlations. GO analysis of 101 putative target genes showed that the biological category 'MAPK signaling pathway' was prominently annotated. Moreover, we detected increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the OC-exposed group. By integrating the transcriptome and microRNAome, we provide evidence that OC can affect MAPK-induced toxicity signaling. Therefore, this study demonstrates the added value of an integrated miRNA-mRNA approach for identifying molecular events induced by environmental pollutants in an in vitro human model.",

Octanal is distributed ubiquitously in the environment and is a component of indoor air pollutants. We investigated whether octanal exposure enhances the inflammatory response in the human respiratory system by increasing the expression and release of cytokines and chemokines. The effect of octanal in transcriptomic modulation was assessed in the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 using oligonucleotide arrays. We identified a set of genes differentially expressed upon octanal exposure that may be useful for monitoring octanal pulmonary toxicity. These genes were classified according to the Gene Ontology functional category and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis to explore the biological processes related to octanal-induced pulmonary toxicity. The results show that octanal affects the expression of several chemokines and inflammatory cytokines and increases the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 released. In conclusion, octanal exposure modulates the expression of cytokines and chemokines important in the development of lung injury and disease. This suggests that inflammation contributes to octanal-induced lung damage and that the inflammatory genes expressed should be studied in detail, thereby laying the groundwork for future biomonitoring studies.",

Tissue activities calculated on the basis of the administered dose and on the radiolabel retained until the animal was killed indicated a redistribution of the radiolabel as metabolic products after 20 min. The labeled carbon was eliminated in a biphasic manner as (11)CO2, which accounted for essentially all of the activity lost by the exposed rats.",

We wished to predict which residues in OR-I7 bind octanal and how the biophysical properties of these residues determine the receptor's odor selectivity. Building on our previous work on aldehyde interactions in olfactory receptors, we constructed a molecular model of OR-I7 based on the 7.5 A resolution three-dimensional map of rhodopsin. Octanal was automatically docked in the model. The results predicted an odor-binding pocket approximately 10 A from the extracellular surface, in a location similar to the epinephrine-binding pocket of the beta-adrenergic receptor and the odor-binding pocket of a previous olfactory receptor model. A lysine on TM4 and an aspartate on TM5 interacted with the aldehyde moiety of octanal. Hydrophobic residues formed Van der Waals contacts with the hydrocarbon portion of octanal. We docked related odor compounds and found that the predicted affinities compared favorably with experimental results. We also tested a number of amino acid substitutions in order to predict their effects on octanal affinity and provide leads for future experimental work.",

Octylaldehyde occurs in several citrus oils, such as orange oil and has been detected in the essential oils of sweet orange, bitter orange, mandarin, tangerine, grapefruit, Mexican lime, lemon, Taiwan citronella, rose, lemongrass, Pinus sabiniana, P. jefferyi, Xanthoxylum rhesta, lime petigrain, clary sage, and lavandin. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.6 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates octylaldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase octylaldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours. Octylaldehyde does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, octylaldehyde is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 290. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.14X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Octylaldehyde has a vapor pressure of 0.6 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, octylaldehyde may volatilize from dry soil. Utilizing the Zahn-Wellens test, 77% degradation was reached using an activated sludge inoculum after 28 days indicates this compound is expected to biodegrade under certain environmental conditions in soil and water. If released into water, octylaldehyde may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 60 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to octylaldehyde may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where octylaldehyde is produced or used. Monitoring data and use information indicate that the general population may be exposed to octylaldehyde via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound or other products containing octylaldehyde.

Activated sludges obtained from the Columbus and Hilliard, Ohio municipal treatment plants were able to oxidize octylaldehyde; Columbus sludge, acclimated to octylaldehyde, had an oxygen uptake of approximately 10 mg/L over 18 hours. By 24 hours, however, this culture had an oxygen uptake of over 100 mg/L indicating that further acclimation was occurring. Hilliard sludge samples rapidly utilized octylaldehyde with oxygen uptake values of over 100 mg/L within the first 6 hours of incubation(2); therefore, this compound is expected to biodegrade under certain environmental conditions(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Octylaldehyde was identified as an ozone disinfection by-product in drinking water samples from a pilot plant in Jefferson Parish, LA which uses Mississippi River as the raw water source; samples were collected following 4 rounds of ozonation treatment performed in January, 1994, August 1994, May 1995, and September 1996(2). Octylaldehyde was not detected when using ozone, ozone with bromide, chloramination, chloramination with bromide, chlorine dioxide, chlorine dioxide with bromide, chlorine, and chlorine with bromide treatments; it was suggested that the bromine consumes some of the disinfectants and results in a small reduction in oxidizing power(3).",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

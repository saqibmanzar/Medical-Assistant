PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Based on a measured vapor pressure of 2.14X10+4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C, chlorotrifluoromethane is expected to exist solely in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase chlorotrifluoromethane is extremely stable in the troposphere. The half-life for the reaction of this compound with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals is about 63 years. This compound will gradually diffuse into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will slowly degrade due to direct photolysis from UV-C radiation and contribute to the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone. The half-life for this reaction has been estimated to range from 180 to 450 years. Chlorotrifluoromethane is expected to have moderate mobility in soils based upon an estimated Koc value of 188. This compound is expected to volatilize rapidly from dry soil surfaces based on its vapor pressure. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon the Henry's Law constant of 1.38 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation is not expected to be an important environmental fate process. In water, chlorotrifluoromethane is not expected to adsorb to sediment or particulate matter given its estimated Koc value. This compound is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces given its Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 97 hours, respectively. Bioconcentration is expected to be low based upon an estimated BCF value of 10. Occupational exposure may be through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chlorotrifluoromethane is produced or used. The general population is exposed to chlorotrifluoromethane through inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase chlorotrifluoromethane is slowly degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 62 years(3,SRC). This compound will gradually diffuse into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will slowly degrade due to direct photolysis from UV-C radiation and contribute to the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone(4,SRC). The half-life for this reaction has been estimated to range from 180 to 450 years(4).",

Chlorotrifluoromethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis or direct photolysis in the troposphere due to the lack of functional groups to hydrolyze or photodegrade due to lack of absorption of light at environmentally significant wavelengths. This compound will gradually diffuse into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will slowly degrade due to direct photolysis from UV-C radiation and contribute to the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone(2,SRC).

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

HUMAN EXPOSURE: The major route of exposure of the general public is from drinking water, as chloral hydrate is formed when drinking water is disinfected with chlorine. Since chloral hydrate is a metabolite of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, people will be exposed to chloral hydrate if they are exposed to these chemicals. The public will be exposed to the metabolites of chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid, as these chemicals are also formed when drinking water is disinfected with chlorine. In its use as a sedative for people, the metabolite trichloroethanol is responsible for the pharmacologic effect. No quantitative information is available from occupational exposure. Chloral hydrate is irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and often causes gastric distress, nausea and vomiting at the recommended clinical dose. An overdose of this drug produces (in order of progression) ataxia, lethargy, deep coma, respiratory depression, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia. There is some evidence of hepatic injury in people surviving near lethal acute overdoses. Despite its long use in human medicine there is no published information on toxicity in controlled studies in humans following extended exposure. Chloral hydrate is completely absorbed and rapidly metabolized following oral admin. In humans the half-life of trichloroethanol and its glucuronide is about 8 hr; the half-life of trichloroacetic acid is about 4 days. Some data suggest that half-life of trichloroethanol is incr several fold in pre-term and full term infants compared with toddlers and adults. The major routes of excretion of the metabolites of chloral hydrate is elimination in the urine.Chloral hydrate and its metabolites have been found in milk from women treated with this drug. There no carcinogenicity data from humans. ANIMAL STUDIES: Acute administration of chloral hydrate to mice causes loss of coordination (ataxia). A 90 day study in mice shows no evidence of behavioral changes or other neurotoxicity. Chronic studies in rats and mice show no evidence of behavioral changes and no evidence of histopathological changes in the nervous tissue. A slight detriment in humoral immunity was observed following exposure of mice for 90 days. This drug has been tested for developmental effects in rats and mice. No structural abnormalities were observed. In a neurodevelopmental study in mice, there was a slight effect in passive avoidance learning. Two bioassays in rats show no incr in tumors at any site. Three separate bioassays in male mice showed an incr incidence of liver tumors. The most definitive of these studies shows an incr incidence and multiplicity of liver tumors at each of three exposures. These data show suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity in male mice but are not considered appropriate for conducting a human health risk assessment with a linear response at low exposure. A variety of results show that chloral hydrate is a weak gene mutagen and clastogen. Chloral hydrate induces aneuploidy in a wide variety of cell types.",

Under the 1996 proposed guidelines (EPA) for carcinogen risk assessment, chloral hydrate shows suggestive evidence of human carcinogenicity by the oral route of exposure. There are no carcinogenicity data from humans. Two bioassays in rats in which chloral hydrate was administered by drinking water show no increase in tumors at any site. Because only minimal toxicity was observed in the livers of the rats in these bioassays, the tests were not conducted at the maximum tolerated dose. A chronic bioassay in female mice showed a slight increase in the severity grade of hyperplasia and a slight increase in the incidence of adenoma in the pituatary gland pars distalis at the highest exposure tested. There is some evidence that chloral hydrate causes hepatocellular tumors in male mice. An earlier study showing an increase of hepatocellular adenomas or trabecular carcinomas following a single bolus exposure could not be confirmed in a study using more animals and higher exposures. Three separate 2-year bioassays in male mice show an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma. There are no data identifying a lesion that is a precursor to the hepatocellular tumors. The strain of mice used has a very high spontaneous incidence of hepatocellular tumors. Two of the matabolites of chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid, have been shown to cause hepatocellular tumors in rodents. Trichloroacetic acid causes hepatocellular tumors only in mice. Dichloroacetic acid causes hepatocellular tumors in both rats and mice. There is an extensive database on genetic toxicity. A variety of results show that chloral hydrate is a weak gene mutagen and clastogen. Chloral hydrate induces aneuploidy in a wide variety of cell types. These latter effects are thought to arise by disruption of the spindle apparatus. A high concentration of chloral hydrate is required to cause observable effects. Although these data suggest that genotoxicity may play a role in the toxicity of chloral hydrate, the data indicate that these effects require concentrations that are unlikely to occur under physiological conditions at the exposures typically encountered from the environment. Collectively, these data provide suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but the weight of evidence is not sufficient to conduct a risk assessment assuming a linear response at low exposure. HUMAN CARCINOGENICITY DATA: None. ANIMAL CARCINOGENICITY DATA: Limited.",

In one analysis of 14 newborns who had nonhemolytic direct hyperbilirubinemia, 10 did not have an identified cause of direct hyperbilirubinemia, and all 10 had received chloral hydrate. In the second retrospective study, all newborns who received chloral hydrate were divided into groups according to whether or not direct hyperbilirubinemia had developed. The newborns with direct hyperbilirubinemia, compared with those without direct hyperbilirubinemia, had received a higher total accumulative dose of chloral hydrate (1035 + or - 286 vs 183 + or - 33 mg/kg + or - 1 SEM, respectively). In the patients with direct hyperbilirubinemia, the direct serum bilirubin levels increased 6.8 + or - 0.8 days after the chloral hydrate administration began and resolved after the chloral hydrate was discontinued or markedly decreased. These data support the hypothesis that prolonged use of chloral hydrate in newborns can be associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia.",

High dose levels of oral chloral hydrate /are defined as/ 80-100 mg/kg, with a maximum total dose of 2 g. High dose chloral hydrate sedation was administered orally to 295 children for 326 computed tomographic examinations. Adverse reactions occurred in 7% of the children, with vomiting being the most common (4.3% of children). Hyperactivity and respiratory symptoms each occurred in less than 2% of children.

Symptoms begin with ataxia and lethargy and progress to deep coma often within 1 to 2 hours of ingestion. Pupils usually are miotic but dilate in the deeper stages of coma. The peculiar pearlike odor of chloral hydrate may help distinguish it from other sedative-hypnotics.",

Selected rats were killed 0, 3, 6, 12, or 24 hr after injection and the stomachs were removed. Strips of the gastric wall were cut from the forestomach to the pylorus through the entire glandular mucosa and examined for mucosal ulcers. Ulcer indices, the total length of all mucosal ulcers per rat, were computed. Ulcers were first detected 6 hr after dosing. The maximum values of the ulcer index, 12.6 mm for ip injection and 6.8 mm after sc injection, occurred at 12 hr. The minimum effective dose for inducing ulcers was 400 mg/kg for ip injection and 600 mg/kg for sc injection. In ip doses of 500 mg/kg or greater and sc doses of 700 mg/kg or greater caused mortality within 12 hr. The authors conclude that chloral hydrate induces gastric ulcers in rats when injected ip or sc. The mechanism of ulcer induction is unknown.",

In regimen A, groups of 48 female mice received 0, 25, 50 or 100 mg chloral hydrate/kg body weight 5 days/wk for 104 wk beginning when they were 28 days old. In regimen B, 24 female mice received 0 mg/kg and three groups of 48 female mice 100 mg/kg 5 days/wk when they were 28 days old.Eight mice from the 0 and 100 mg/kg groups were killed at 3, 6 or 12 months. The remaining mice were held without further dosing for the duration of the 2 yr study. In regimen C, groups of 48 female mice received a single dose of 0, 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg when they were 28 days old and were held for 104 wk. In regimens D and E groups of 48 female and 48 male mice, respectively, received a single dose of 0, 10, 25, 50 mg/kg when they were 15 days old and were held for 104 wk. ... CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this 2 yr gavage study, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of chloral hydrate in female B6C3F1 mice treated continuously for 2 yr based on the incr incidences of pituitary gland pars distalis adenomas. No incr incidences of neoplams were seen in female B6C3F1 mice that recieved a single dose of chloral hydrate at 15 or 28 days of age or in male B6C3F1 mice that received a single dose of chloral hydrate at 15 days of age. No hepatocarcinogenicity was seen under any dosing condition.",

Chloral hydrate was shown to produce chromosomal damage in mammalian cells. It induced significant increases in sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without S9. Results of sexlinked recessive lethal (SLRL) tests in Drosophila melanogaster were inconclusive. Chloral hydrate, administered by feeding, produced an inconclusive increase in SLRL mutations in the germ cells of male flies. Results of an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test with chloral hydrate were positive.",

Each dose group was divided into two dietary groups of 60 mice. The ad libitum-fed mice had free access to feed, and the dietary-controlled mice received feed in  measured daily amounts calculated to maintain body weight on a previously computed idealized body weight curve. Twelve mice from each diet and dose group were evaluated at 15 months. ... CONCLUSIONS Under the conditions used in this 2-year gavage study, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of chloral hydrate in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in ad libitum-fed mice and on increased incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma in dietary-controlled mice. In the dietary-controlled mice, induction of enzymes associated with peroxisome proliferation was observed at higher doses.",

One male rat receiving 800 mg/kg died after five doses. Two 800 mg/kg female rats died after dosing ended but before study termination. One male mouse in each group except the 400 mg/kg group died before the end of the study. Two 800 mg/kg female mice also died before the end of the study.

The mean body weight gains of all groups of dosed male mice were significantly greater than that of the vehicle control group. The only clinical finding in rats and mice attributed to chloral hydrate treatment was light sedation in the 400 mg/kg groups and heavy sedation in the 800 mg/kg groups; sedation subsided within 30 minutes or 3 hours, respectively. The liver weights of 400 mg/kg male mice and 800 mg/kg male and female mice were significantly greater than those of the vehicle control groups.

In summary, due to the absence of chloral hydrate-induced histopathologic lesions in rats and mice, no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were based on body weights of rats and liver weights of mice. The NOAELs for rats and mice were 200 mg/kg.",

Chloral hydrate's production in organic synthesis and use as a sedative may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 15 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chloral hydrate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase chloral hydrate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 days. The related aldehyde chloral is readily photolyzed in sunlight based on its atmospheric half-life of 4.5-6 hours; therefore, atmospheric photolysis of chloral hydrate may be a major degradation pathway. If released to soil, chloral hydrate is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 82. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.7X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data for chloral hydrate were not available. In water, chloral hydrate is formed from the exothermic reaction of chloral with water, in which chloral hydrate is in equilibrium. Chloral hydrate hydrolyzes to form chloroform at high pH. Chloral hydrate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Chloral hydrate hydrolyzes to form chloroform at high pH. Occupational exposure to chloral hydrate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chloral hydrate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to chloral hydrate via ingestion of chlorinated drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound when swimming in chlorinated pools; limited exposure is expected from its use as a sedative.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.1X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 15 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 7.93X10+5 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 days and 88 days, respectively(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

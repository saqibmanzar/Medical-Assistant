If there are any indications of weakness, ataxia, or other neurologic impairment, clothing should be removed and a complete bath and shampoo given while the victim is recumbent, using copious amounts of soap and water. Attendants should wear rubber gloves. Surgical green soap is excellent for this purpose, but ordinary soap is about as good. The possibility of pesticide sequestered under fingernails or in skin folds should not be overlooked. Contaminated clothing should be promptly bagged and not returned until it has been thoroughly laundered. Contaminated leather shoes should be discarded. The possibility that pesticide has contaminated the inside surfaces of gloves, boots, and headgear should be considered. /Solid organochlorine insecticides/",

The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

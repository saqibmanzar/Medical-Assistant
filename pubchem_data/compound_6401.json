The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,2-dibromo-1,1-dichloroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,2-dibromo-1,1-dichloroethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 890 days. If released to soil, 1,2-dibromo-1,1-dichloroethane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 97. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. 1,2-Dibromo-1,1-dichloroethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 1,2-dibromo-1,1-dichloroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.5 and 9 hrs, respectively. An estimated BCF of 50 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis is expected with half-lives of 52 and 5 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to 1,2-dibromo-1,1-dichloroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2-dibromo-1,1-dichloroethane is produced or used.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.5 hrs and 9 days, respectively(SRC). Under basic conditions, however, hydrolysis of 1,2-dibromo-1,1-dichloroethane will compete with volatilization from surface waters(SRC). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 1.5 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(5); this corresponds to half-lives of 52 and 5 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 50(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 3(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Preservation of hepatic functional integrity was assessed through analysis of perfusate constituents and animal survival after perfusion. Flow to the liver during perfusion was greater than 1 ml/min/g with one-third of total flow provided through the hepatic artery and two-thirds through the portal vein. Perfusion duration was 3 h. The pO2 gradient across the liver indicated that oxygen was consumed during perfusion at both temperatures. The expected rise in pCO2 and decrease in pH of the outflow perfusate is consistent with active aerobic metabolism. Perfusate chemistries lactate, pyruvate, glucose, urea, total alpha-amino acids, ketone bodies and SGPT demonstrated that hepatic functional integrity was maintained during perfusion. Significant differences (p less than 0.05) between temperatures occurred in the perfusate levels of lactate, pyruvate, L/P ratios, glucose and total alpha-amino acids. Animal survival after a 3-hour perfusion was 3/4 at 37 degrees C, and 2/5 at 43 degrees C. After perfusion, SGPT levels were significantly higher in dogs subjected to perfusion at 43 degrees C. The success of these experiments demonstrates that perfusion of the liver with Fluosol-43 was not in itself hepatotoxic, and that Fluosol-43 may allow perfusion of the liver at 43 degrees C with only mild toxicity. /oxypherol (FC-43)/",

At 10 days after implantation, control animals had a macrotumor weighing about 100 mg with large part of central necrosis. The tumor-bearing rats for 10 days after implantation were randomly divided into 4 groups; a control group, a Fluosol-43 treatment group, a BCNU treatment group, and a Fluosol-43 plus BCNU treatment group. Control animals had mean survival time of 19.94 +/- 2.41 (S.D.) days, and mean survival time of Fluosol-43 treatment group was 19.47 +/- 1.36 days. BCNU treatment alone prolonged the mean survival time to 28.36 +/- 7.94 days (p less than 0.001). Fluosol-43 plus BCNU treatment group showed 36.00 +/- 10.15 days, which was significantly greater than that of BCNU treatment alone group (p less than 0.005). The long survivals lived over 50 days after implantation were 7 out of 27 rats in Fluosol-43 plus BCNU treatment group, in contrast to one out of 25 rats in BCNU treatment alone group. Perfluorochemicals (Fluosol-43) may have the synergistic effect on BCNU chemotherapy for brain tumors. /fluosol-43/",

It was injected into the vitreous of 38 rabbit eyes after mechanical vitrectomy or gas compression of the vitreous with perfluoropropane. The eyes were observed for periods of up to 5 months. Clinically the liquid occupied the lower vitreous space but gradually dispersed into smaller fluorochemical droplets. In the upper vitreous clusters of cells appeared within 3-4 weeks which precipitated on the posterior lens surface and in the cortical vitreous. In eyes with experimental retinal detachment perfluorotributylamine had physical properties which provided mechanical retinal tamponade. Its interfacial tension prevented passage through iatrogenic retinal breaks. Histopathologic findings showed irregularly shaped defects in the outer segment disks as early as 2 days after vitreous replacement. These changes appeared to reverse if perfluorotributylamine was removed after 2 days. The cellular response in the vitreous consisted primarily of monocyte-derived macrophages capable of ingesting fluorochemical (foam cells).",

Twenty eight eyes were divided into three groups. In the first group (n=14), which was used as a control, only vitrectomy was performed. In the second group (n=6), the vitreous was temporarily substituted with perfluorotributylamine after the vitrectomy. One hour after the operation, the injected perfluorotributylamine was again replaced with a balanced salt solution (SM-A2). In the third group (n=8), the injected perfluorotributylamine was left in the eye until the time of enucleation. The eyes were evaluated both electrophysiologically and histopathologically, at predetermined time intervals ranging from 1-4 weeks after operation. All the eyes in the second group did not show any histopathological changes until 4 weeks after the operation. The ERGs obtained from these eyes exhibited dominant a- and b-waves similar to those of the control group at all intervals after operation. However, the eyes in the third group showed progressive deterioration with elapsed of time. At the 2 wk after operation, b-wave amplitudes moderately decreased in 2 eyes. These eyes showed an initial slight degeneration in the outer segment layer. At 4 wk after the operation, the a- and b-waves further decreased in amplitude with a significantly prolonged peak latency. The outer segments were severely damaged, and the histopathological changes extended to the inner segment layer as well as the RPE layer.",

It was shown that perfluorodecaline is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P-450 system in the liver. The sharp increase of the cytochrome P-450 content and of the enzymatic activity was observed within 5 months. The biological effect of perfluorotributylamine on the monooxygenase system of the liver was much less pronounced. A slight inhibition of the cytochrome P-450 system was observed at short times after the injection followed by its slight stimulation after 2 weeks; 30 days thereafter all the parameters under study returned to control values.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.552 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates perfluorotributylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Fluorinated organic compounds are resistant to hydrolysis and photolysis. If released to soil, perfluorotributylamine is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.2X10+9. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10+4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Perfluorotributylamine is confirmed to be non biodegradable. If released into water, perfluorotributylamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.3 hrs and 10 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. A BCF range of 3-34 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to perfluorotributylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where perfluorotributylamine is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that perfluorotributylamine is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 2.6 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 10 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 4.1X10+4 years if adsorption is considered(3). Perfluorotributylamine's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC); however, this will be attenuated by adsorption. Perfluorotributylamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.552 mm Hg(4).",

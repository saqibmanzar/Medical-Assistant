When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The results suggest a partial saturation in the dealkylation process at high dose levels in three patients. A rough approximation of the Michaelis-Menten constants for different enzymatic processes was attempted. On the basis of the results obtained, the p-hydroxylation may be a saturable process. The dose-dependent kinetics of ethotoin in man seem to be explicable by the existence of partly saturable enzymatic pathways.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Decontamination: administer activated charcoal orally if conditions are appropriate. Gastric lavage is not necessary after small to moderate ingestions if activated charcoal can be given promptly.

Mean (+/- S.E.) maternal serum concentrations of PHT, MPH, and ETH 1 hr after dosing on gestational day 18 were 16.0 +/- 3.3, 10.7 +/- 3.0, and 65.2 +/- 10.45, respectively, and free fractions were 16%, 18%, and 11% respectively. The free fraction for PHT is similar, but was lower for both MPH and ETH than that seen in humans. Preweaning mortality for PHT, MPH, ETH, HYD, and controls was 25%, 6.3%, 12.5%, 2.0% and 0.8%, respectively. The MPH and ETH exposed animals weighed approximately 6.6% less than controls throughout the study; the other groups did not differ significantly. PHT offspring showed incr early locomotor activity. Only PHT exposed animals (27%) exhibited abnormal circling behavior after weaning. PHT-circlers accounted for higher levels of activity in an open field test and for longer straight channel swimming times. PHT-circlers and noncirclers differed from one another and controls on performance of a complex (Cincinnati) maze and on the development of the air-righting reflex. Offspring prenatally exposed to MPH showed an early delay in air-righting. ETH and HYD offspring were not consistently different from controls in behavior. The data suggest the following ordinal relationship among the drugs for behavioral teratogenesis: PHT much greater than MPH greater than ETH congruent to HYD congruent to CON. The effects of PHT are consistent with previous findings. Data on the other drugs suggest that other hydantoins do not possess the behavioral teratogenic efficacy of PHT and that PHT may be unique in its effects on CNS development.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

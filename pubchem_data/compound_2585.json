When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in angina patients following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers. The last 2 complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. As with other beta-blockers, when discontinuation of carvedilol is planned, the patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum. Carvedilol should be discontinued over 1 to 2 weeks whenever possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that carvedilol be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue therapy with carvedilol abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension or heart failure.",

In a placebo-controlled trial of patients with severe heart failure, worsening heart failure during the first 3 months was reported to a similar degree with carvedilol and with placebo. When treatment was maintained beyond 3 months, worsening heart failure was reported less frequently in patients treated with carvedilol than with placebo.

Here, /investigators/ determined the significance of this phenomenon on human beta-ARs in vitro and in vivo. Experiments were conducted on human atrial trabeculae (n=8 to 10 per group). In the presence of metoprolol, isoproterenol potency was reduced compared with controls (P<0.001). In the presence of carvedilol, isoproterenol identified 2 distinct binding sites of high (36+/-6%; -8.8+/-0.4 log mol/L) and low affinity (-6.5+/-0.2 log mol/L). After beta-blocker washout, isoproterenol potency returned to control values in metoprolol-treated muscles, whereas in carvedilol-treated preparations, isoproterenol potency remained decreased (P<0.001 versus control). In vivo studies were performed in 9 individuals receiving metoprolol succinate (190 mg/d) or carvedilol (50 mg/d) for 11 days in a randomized crossover design. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (5 to 40 ug x kg(-1) x min(-1)) was performed before, during, and 44 hours after application of study medication. Beta-blocker medication reduced heart rate, heart rate-corrected velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, and cardiac output compared with baseline (P<0.02 to 0.0001). After withdrawal of metoprolol, all parameters returned to baseline values, whereas after carvedilol, all parameters remained reduced (P<0.05 to 0.001) despite complete plasma elimination of carvedilol. Carvedilol but not metoprolol inhibits the catecholamine response of the human heart beyond its plasma elimination. The persistent beta-blockade by carvedilol may be explained by binding of carvedilol to an allosteric site of beta-ARs.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Carvedilol causes reductions in cardiac output, exercise-induced tachycardia, isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and reflex orthostatic tachycardia. Clinically important beta-adrenergic blocking activity of carvedilol usually is evident within 1 hour of oral administration, and the drug's hypotensive effect is similar to that of metoprolol. Carvedilol's alpha1-adrenergic blocking effects, which contribute to the drug's hypotensive effects, generally are evident within 30 minutes of oral administration and include reductions in phenylephrine-induced pressor effects, vasodilation, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. The dose-dependent hypotensive effect of carvedilol results in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) reductions of 5-46% with little, if any, reflex tachycardia. This hypotensive effect occurs approximately 30 minutes after oral administration and has a maximum effect 1.5-7 hours after oral administration.",

Since the two enantiomers differ in pharmacological properties, it is necessary to individually measure their plasma concentrations in order to evaluate the pharmacological effects of racemic carvedilol after oral administration. In this study, a sensitive, stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatographic assay was used to determine the plasma concentration of each enantiomer. The assay involves the diastereomeric derivatization of racemic carvedilol with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate as a chiral reagent. After oral administration of racemic carvedilol to humans, the mean Cmax and AUC infinity values for R(+)-enantiomer were 2.6 and 2.8 times greater, respectively, than those for the more active S(-)-enantiomer. Similarly, in monkeys, the respective R:S enantiomer ratios for Cmax and AUC infinity were 1.5 and 1.2. The difference in AUCoral between these enantiomers is ascribed to the greater intrinsic clearance of S(-)-enantiomer than that of the R(+)-enantiomer in the liver, and to a lower plasma protein binding of the S(-)-enantiomer.",

If peripheral vasodilation dominates, it may be necessary to administer adrenaline or noradrenaline with continuous monitoring of circulatory conditions. For therapy-resistant bradycardia, pacemaker therapy should be performed. For bronchospasm, beta-sympathomimetics (as aerosol or iv) or aminophylline iv should be given. In the event of seizures, slow iv injection of diazepam or clonazepam is recommended. In the event of severe intoxication where there are symptoms of shock, treatment with antidotes must be continued for a sufficiently long period of time consistent with the 7- to 10-hour half-life of carvedilol.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.9X10-14 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates carvedilol will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase carvedilol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Carvedilol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, carvedilol is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 790. The estimated pKa1 of carvedilol is 8.77 (secondary amine), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an cation and cations do not volatilize. Carvedilol may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, carvedilol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The estimated pKa indicates carvedilol will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces and bioconcetration are not expected to be an important fate processes. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to carvedilol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where carvedilol is produced or used. Use data indicate that limited general population exposure to carvedilol will be via ingestion of pharmaceutical products containing carvedilol, an antihypertensive. (SRC)",

Carvedilol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 5.9X10-14 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(6).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

                                "Description": "Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPGs) are air concentration guidelines for single exposures to agents, developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.23X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzoic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. However, the pKa of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid is 0.65, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.62X10-14 atm-cu m/mole. After 180 minutes, very little oxygen consumption by phenol-adapted biological cultures occurred with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant and its pKa. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid may occur through inhalation of mists and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid is produced or used.

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

HLPC analysis of hepatocyte incubations revealed that phenols were the major metabolites in both cases. P1NA formed one phenolic metabolite only, while incubation with P2NA yielded two phenols identified as 6-hydroxy-P2NA and 4'-hydroxy-P2NA by chromatography with authentic samples. beta-Naphthylamine, a metabolite indicating dephenylation of P2NA was not detectable. Metabolism studies with microsomes revealed that the phenols were formed by cytochrome p450 dependent monooxygenases. Pretreatment of animals with phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene both incr the rate of microsomal metabolism of P1NA and P2NA, indicating that more than one p450 enzyme mediate the oxygenation reaction. Animal pretreatment with single and repeated doses of P1NA and P2NA did not markedly stimulate metabolism, but induced ethylmorphine demethylation in males and females and benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation in females.",

In addition, this section contains information on appropriate engineering controls (e.g., use local exhaust ventilation, or use only in an enclosed system) as well as recommendations for personal protective measures to prevent illness or injury from exposure to chemicals, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., appropriate types of eye, face, skin or respiratory protection needed based on hazards and potential exposure).",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

In the atmosphere, it should exist in the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor phase N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine is expected to degrade rapidly (estimated half-life of 55 minutes) by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. Particulate-phase N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine may be removed via dry deposition. If released to soil, N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine may undergo a covalent chemical bonding with humic materials which can result in its chemical alteration to a latent form and prevent leaching. In the absence of covalent bonding, N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine will be immobile in soil. Photolysis may be important on soil surfaces. N-Phenyl-2-naphthylamine should rapidly biodegrade to beta-naphthylamine at concns <5 ppm in soil and water; however, the apparent covalent bonding and adsorption may reduce biodegradation. In water, covalent bonding with humic materials in the water column and sediments may result in partitioning from the water column to sediments. By analogy to the aromatic amine chemical class, N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine may be susceptible to photolysis and photooxidation via hydroxyl and peroxy radicals in water. Experimental data suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms will not be an important fate process. Hydrolysis and volatilization from water should not be important. In occupational settings, workers may be exposed to N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine through inhalation and through eye and skin contact. (SRC)",

Because N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine absorbs UV light >290 nm(3), photolysis may be important if N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine is spilled on terrestrial surfaces(SRC). By analogy to other aromatic amines(1), when released to soil, N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine may undergo covalent chemical bonding with humic materials which can result in its chemical alteration to a latent form and result in tight adsorption. When covalently bound in this latent form, leaching in soil systems is not expected to occur. This covalent bonding proceeds in two steps: a rapid and reversible bonding followed by a slower and much less reversible reaction(1,SRC). In the absence of covalent bonding, leaching would not be possible based on an estimated Koc of 12,500(4-6).",

Because N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine abosorbs UV light >290 nm(4), photolysis may be important in near-surface water. A BCF value of 147(3,SRC) suggests that N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine will have low potential to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC).

According to a suggested classification scheme(2), this vapor pressure value suggests that N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine will probably be removed from air via dry deposition. Vapor-phase N- phenyl-2-naphthylamine is degraded rapidly in an average ambient atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals at an estimated half-life of about 55 minutes(3,SRC).",

An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

As a class, aromatic amines react relatively rapidly in sunlit natural water via reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals and peroxy radicals(3); typical half-lives for hydroxyl radical and peroxy radical reaction are on the order of 19-30 sunlight hours(3); however, rate data specific to N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine were not located(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In the absence of covalent bonding, one can estimate the adsorption potential based on the Koc value. Based on an experimental log octanol-water partition coefficient of 4.38(2) and a recommended regression-derived equation(1), the Koc value for N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine can be estimated to be 12,500(SRC). According to a suggested classification scheme(3), this Koc value indicates that N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine will be immobile in soil.",

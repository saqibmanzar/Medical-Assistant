When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Due to a high rate of mortality (3/5) among the 250 mg/kg females during the initial study, a second trial in 5 female rats receiving 250 mg/kg was conducted with data combined for 10 high-dose females. All animals were necropsied on the 29th day of study. Females of the high dose group only (4/10) died during the 28-day treatment period. Clinical signs, observed intermittently in this group between study days 11 and 24 and mainly among the intercurrent decedents, included hypoactivity, stilted gait, swollen abdomen, and labored breathing. A solitary high-dose male demonstrated impaired respiration. Bodyweights, organ weights, food and water consumption, urinalyses, and hematological and clinical chemistry evaluations did not deviate significantly from those of controls in any dose group. Upon necropsy, discolored lungs with surface red spots and foamy content, and a solitary small spleen characterized the gross pathology, identified solely in the decedent females. Microscopic examination revealed distinct lesions among these animals, which included organ congestion, hemorrhagic and/or edematous lungs, and profound loss and atrophy of splenic lymphatic follicles and lymphoid sheath, respectively. One symptomatic male of a 250 mg/kg dose group exhibited focal epithelial degeneration of the forestomach which authors claimed was likely due to an irritative effect of the compound.",

Following the 7-day induction, 48-hour challenge was administered with a 0.3 mL topical application of 1% solution in distilled water under occluded patch covering the entire test area. A second 48-hour challenge was performed 21 days later with a 0.3 mL topical application of 5% solution and another of vehicle alone, each on either side of the dorsal midline to cover triplet test sites. Although pretest irritation results were not provided, the authors concluded that positive reaction in 93% (14/15) of the test animals, relative to 0% response (0/6) in the vehicle/FCA control group and 100% response in the dinitrochlorobenzene (positive control) group following 5% N,N-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine second challenge, established a maximization grading of \"extreme\" sensitization.",

Iodine has a high atomic density, which gives it the ability to attenuate X-rays. The intravascular administration of iodine compounds, such as ioversol, enhances the contrast between vessels in the path of the flow of the contrast medium and normal tissue, allowing the visualization of internal structures. Ioversol is a highly hydrophilic agent considered to be generally safe; however, serious adverse reactions have been reported due to the inadvertent intrathecal administration of ioversol, which is only indicated for intra-arterial and intravenous use.  Ioversol was approved by the FDA in 1989 and is currently indicated for computed tomographic (CT) imaging and contrast enhancement in peripheral arteriography, coronary arteriography, and left ventriculography.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Immediately after ioversol is injected, a peak in iodine plasma levels can be detected. However, depending on the organ being imaged, the time to maximum contrast will vary. The time to maximum contrast enhancement will range from the time iodine plasma levels reach their highest concentration to one hour after intravenous bolus administration. The delay between a peak in iodine plasma levels and maximum contrast enhancement is partly due to the accumulation of iodine-containing medium within a lesion and outside the blood pool.  For angiographies, the maximum contrast enhancement of ioversol occurs almost immediately (15-120 seconds). Following rapid intravenous injection, ioversol can be visualized in the renal parenchyma within 30 to 60 seconds. In patients with normal renal function, opacification of the calyces and pelves takes place within 1-3 minutes, with an optimum contrast within 5-15 minutes.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

However, in patients with a disrupted blood-brain barrier, ioversol accumulates in the interstitial space of the disrupted region.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

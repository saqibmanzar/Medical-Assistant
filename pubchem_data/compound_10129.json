If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The major metabolites were as follows: (-)-trans-verbenol from (+)-, (-)-, and (+/-)-alpha-pinenes; (-)-10-pinanol and (-)-1-p-menthene-7,8-diol from (-)-beta-pinene; (-)-alpha-terpineol and (-)-trans-sobrerol from (-)-cis-pinane; (-)-m-mentha-4,6-dien-8-ol, 3-caren-9-ol, (-)-3-carene-9-carboxylic acid, and 3-carene-9,10-dicarboxylic acid from (+)-3-carene; carane-9,10-dicarboxylic acid from (-)-cis-carane; and myrcene-3(10)-glycol, myrcene-1,2-glycol, uroterpenol, and p-cymene-9-carboxylic acid from p-cymene. These metabolisms include allylic oxidation, epoxidation, stereoselective gem-dimethyl hydroxylation and its oxidation, cleavage of a conjugated double bond by epoxidation, and regioselective oxidation, some of which are not found usually in chemical reactions, and due to which various new compounds were determined. This biotransformation of the monoterpene hydrocarbons gave some insect pheromones in high yield.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dihydropinene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dihydropinene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 29 hr. Dihydropinene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dihydropinene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.35 atm-cu m/mole. Dihydropinene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, dihydropinene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hr and 4.7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 450 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Dihydropinene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to dihydropinene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dihydropinene is produced or used. Use data suggests that the general population may be exposed to dihyropinene via inhalation of and dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase dihydropinene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 29 hr(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.34X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Dihydropinene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

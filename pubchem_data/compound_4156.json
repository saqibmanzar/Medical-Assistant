ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This altered base, however, has been postulated to be indirectly deleterious to cells due to the increased lability of the /glycosyl/ bond, leading to the formation of noninstructive apurinic sites in the DNA template. Another abundant lesion formed is 3-methyladenine. This product has been shown to block nucleic acid synthesis, but direct evidence that it is a lethal moiety in mammalian cells is lacking. The primary promutagenic lesions formed by methylating agents are O6-methylguanine and O-4-methylthymine, both of which can cause base transitions in newly synthesized DNA. O-Methylguanine is formed to a higher extent than O-4-methylthymine, and it has been demonstrated that guanines preceded at 5' by adenine are twice as likely to be methylated at the O6 position as those preceded by thymine, indicating the existence of base sequence effects on adduct formation. Another lesion formed by methylating agents is the methylphosphotriester. This persistent adduct clearly slows nucleic acid synthesis in cell-free systems, but its effect on gene expression or mutagenesis in cells is not clear. ... Longer chain alkylating agents produce similar spectra of damage, but the relative proportions of the adducts formed are significantly different. The lesions formed in the greatest quantities are the alkylphosphotriesters, which represent more than 50% of the total damage to the DNA. The promutagenic lesion that becomes increasingly important with these agents is O4-alkylthymine. It is produced in amounts five- to tenfold greater than occur with methylating agents, and, although it is slowly removed from DNA, its half-life is significantly longer than that for O6-alkylguanine, making it potentially more important in causing point mutations following DNA synthesis.",

In other experiments cells were simultaneously treated with methyl methanesulfonate at a concentration of D20 and ethyl methanesulfonate at various concentrations for 3, 6 or 9 hr. The mathematical analysis of the combined effects of both chemicals for cell killing (cytotoxicity) and 6-thioguanine resistant mutations indicates that synergistic interactions were observed for both cell killing and mutations induced by methyl methanesulfonate and ethyl methanesulfonate. The frequency of chromosome aberrations induced by simultaneous treatment with methyl methanesulfonate at a concentration of D20 and ethyl methanesulfonate at various concentrations for 3 hr was additive. However, the frequency of chromosome aberrations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate at a concentration of D20 and methyl methanesulfonate at various concentrations for 3 hr was not significantly different from those induced by methyl methanesulfonate alone.",

Clinical symptoms were correlated with DNA repair parameters measured in fibroblasts grown from skin biopsies. Classification according to the international complementation groups revealed that of the 61 patients 3 belonged to group A, 26 to group C, 16 to group D, 3 to group E, and 2 to group F; 11 were of the xeroderma pigmentosum variant type. A striking clinical aspect was the frequency of histogenetically different skin tumors varying from one xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group to the other: squamous and basal cell carinomas predominated in xeroderma pigmentosum group C; lentigo maligna melanomas were most frequent in group D; basal cell carcinomas occurred preferentially in group E and xeroderma pigmentosum variants. Three DNA repair parameters were determined for 46 fibroblast strains: colony forming ability; DNA repair synthesis; and DNA incising capacity. Dose response experiments with up to 13 dose levels were performed throughout to achieve sufficient experimental accuracy. DNA damaging treatments included UV light, the UV like carcinogen N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene, and the alkylating carcinogens methyl methanesulfonate and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Comparison of clinical signs and repair data was made on the basis of colony forming ability, DNA repair synthesis, and DNA incising capacity values of both individual cell strains and weighted means of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups. Despite considerable clinical and biochemical heterogeneity within complementation groups distinctive features emerged. In general, colony forming ability, DNA repair synthesis, and DNA incising capacity values of all xeroderma pigmentosum strains investigated, including xeroderma pigmentosum variants, were found to be reduced upon treatment with UV light or N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene. After treatment with UV light or N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene, cell strains in which DNA incising capacity was reduced also showed a similar reduction in both colony forming ability and DNA repair synthesis. Consequently, the weighted mean colony forming ability, DNA repair synthesis, and DNA incising capacity values of complementation groups and xeroderma pigmentosum variants correlated with each other. Furthermore, the onset of both early dermatological symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum and tumor growth correlated with the extent of DNA repair defects. Of 45 xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblast strains checked for colony forming ability after treatment with methyl methanesulfonate only 3 cell strains from group D were found to be more sensitive than normal controls, suggesting that overall repair in xeroderma pigmentosum strains was equal to that in controls. Weighted means of DNA repair synthesis of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups, however, showed reductions hinting at impaired excision of distinct alkylated bases. This held true for complementation groups, D, A, E, and F. Upon treatment with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, the weighted mean DNA repair synthesis values of the complementation groups did not differ significantly from that of controls, ... However, the weighted mean colony forming ability value of complementation group D was significantly reduced, ...",

Transformed epithelial cell lines with the non-tumorigenic phenotype could be converted to a progressively growing tumor phenotype following treatment with either methylmethane sulfonate or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. In contrast, sarcoma derived cell lines with a non-tumorigenic phenotype could be converted to a progressively growing tumor phenotype only with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. SV40 immortalized HET-1A non-tumorigenic phenotype cells could be converted to a progressively growing tumorigenic phenotype, infrequently, when treated with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, but not methylmethane sulfonate. Progressively growing tumors produced by either methylmethane sulfonate or N- methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine treated non-tumorigenic phenotypes exhibited metastatic potential in nude mice. Chemically treated HET-1A cells acquired the abilty to produce tumor in mice but the tumor did not exhibit metastatic potential. In contrast, populations of tumorigenic cells were not rendered more biologically aggressive after treatment with either methylmethane sulfonate or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; ie, the latency period for tumor development was not accelerated and the tumors did not exhibit metastatic potential. ...",

Tertiary cultures, isolated from 3 separate individuals, were exposed to the direct acting experimental carcinogen, methyl methanesulfonate.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl methanesulfonate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl methanesulfonate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 70 days. Methyl methanesulfonate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methyl methanesulfonate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 12. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl methanesulfonate is expected to hydrolyze rapidly in the presence of water with measured half-lives of 4.56 hours, 9.66 hours, and 77 hours and this is expected to be the major fate process for this compound in water and moist soil environments. Methyl methanesulfonate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, methyl methanesulfonate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. While volatilization from water surfaces may occur based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant, the hydrolysis of methyl methanesulfonate is expected to be the major fate process for this compound in water. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since methyl methansulfonate is no longer produced or used in the US. In the past, methyl methanesulfonate was used as a research chemical and it is expected that inhalation and dermal exposure to this compound would be minimized under these circumstances. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase methyl methanesulfonate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 70 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.3X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

This section also includes information on whether the chemical is considered as a potential carcinogen according to authoritative sources such as the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens and the International agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs.",

Bleeding of nose and gums, ulceration of the nasal and oral mucosa, pulmonary edema, chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia may also occur. If the eyes have come in contact with dimethyldichlorosilane, irritation, pain, swelling, corneal erosion, and blindness may result. Dermatitis (red, inflamed skin), severe burns, pain, and shock generally follow dermal exposure. Inhalation irritates mucous membranes. Severe gastrointestinal damage may occur. Vapors cause severe eye and lung injury. Upon short contact, second and third degree burns may occur. Signs and symptoms of acute ingestion of dimethyldichlorosilane may be severe and include increased salivation, intense thirst, difficulty swallowing, chills, pain, and shock. Oral, esophageal, and stomach burns are common. /Dimethyldichlorosilane/",

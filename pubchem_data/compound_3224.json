Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Also, they may be incompatible with many amines, nitrides, azo/diazo compounds, alkali metals, and epoxides. As an ester, it will hydrolyze to form sulfur dioxide and diol; reaction is more rapid under basic conditions.",

The Agency has completed its assessment of the dietary (food and drinking water), ecological and occupational risks associated with the use of currently registered pesticides containing the active ingredient endosulfan. Based on a review of these data and public comments on the Agency's assessments for the active ingredient endosulfan, EPA has sufficient information on the human health and ecological effects of endosulfan to make decisions as part of the tolerance reassessment process under FFDCA and reregistration under FIFRA, as amended by FQPA. The Agency has reassessed all 80 tolerances for endosulfan and can make a FQPA safety determination ... The Agency has determined that agricultural use of endosulfan, based on the currently approved labeling, pose occupational and ecological risks that constitute unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. However, the Agency believes that these risks can likely be acceptably mitigated through routine changes to pesticide labeling and formulations. Accordingly, the Agency has determined that endosulfan is eligible for reregistration provided that: (i) additional data that the Agency intends to require confirm this decision for occupational exposures associated with the application of dip treatment to roots or whole plants and ecological risks; and (ii) the risk mitigation measures outlined in this document are adopted, and label amendments are made to reflect these measures. ... Further mitigation measures and additional data requirements, however, may be warranted following the completion of the stakeholder process outlined in this document. Based on its evaluation of endosulfan, the Agency has determined that endosulfan products, unless labeled and used as specified in this document, would present risks inconsistent with FIFRA. Accordingly, should a registrant fail to implement any of the risk mitigation measures identified in this document, the Agency may take regulatory action to address the risk concerns from use of endosulfan.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer saftey standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Endosulfan is found on List A, which contains most pesticides that are used on foods and, hence, have a high potential for human exposure. List A consists of the 194 chemical cases (or 350 individual active ingredients) for which EPA issued registration standards prior to FIFRA '88. Case No: 0014; Pesticide type: Insecticide (Acaricide); Registration Standard Date: 04/01/82; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document.; Active ingredient (AI): Endosulfan; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 05/10/94, 10/13/95; AI Status: The producers of the pesticide has made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

Livers of /New Zealand white/ rabbits were examined grossly and histopathologically, and caspase-3 activity was detected by immunohistochemical methods. A total of twenty-four rabbits were divided into four groups (n=6). Rabbits in Group I (endosulfan (END)) were daily given a sublethal dose of endosulfan (1mg/kgbw) in corn oil by oral gavage for 6 weeks. Group II (END+C) received the same dose of endosulfan and additionally Vit C (20mg/kgbw) every other day during this period. Group III (OIL+C) received corn oil daily by oral gavage and vitamin C every other day for 6 weeks. Group IV (OIL), the control group, received only corn oil daily, by oral gavage throughout the experiment. The concentration of alpha-endosulfan in the END group was higher in livers (0.102+/-0.012 ppb) than the beta-endosulfan (0.072+/-0.001 ppb). Decreased accumulation of alpha and beta endosulfan was observed in the END+C group (0.025+/-0.003 and 0.016+/-0.002 ppb, respectively) (p<0.0001). The most prominent gross findings at the necropsy were seen in the END group, in which swollen and pale livers were commonly observed. Hemorrhages, degenerations, necrosis, and in some rabbits bile duct hyperplasia were the marked histopathological findings of the END group. Caspase-3 positive reaction was more severe in this group than in the others. An ameliorating effect of Vit C on gross, histopathological and immunohistochemical findings was observed in the END+C group. The results revealed that endosulfan is highly toxic for rabbit livers. However, toxicity was decreased by Vit C treatment, which reduced the accumulation of endosulfan in livers four-fold.",

Aspirate oral and pharyngeal secretion, and when possible, insert an oropharyngeal airway to maintain an open passage unobstructed by the tongue. Minimize noise and any manipulation of the patient that may trigger seizure activity. Seizures in patients caused by organochlorine toxicity are likely to be prolonged and difficult to control. Status epilepticus is common. For this reason, patients with seizures that do not respond immediately to anticonvulsants should be transferred as soon as possible to a trauma center and will generally require intensive care admission until seizures are controlled and neurologic status is improved. Initial therapy with benzodiazepines should be instituted. /Solid organochlorine insecticides/"

Acute intoxication with endosulfan involves two stages: gastrointestinal symptoms, tonic-clonic convulsions, respiratory depression, metabolic acidosis, and hyperglycemia and hemodynamic instability appear within 4 hours of ingestion.

A high blood endosulfan level and initial hypotension indicate poor prognosis. The doses required to produce death are relatively large, and reports of death in humans were found only in cases of accidental or intentional ingestion of large quantities of endosulfan-containing pesticides.  ...",

The pesticide caused hypertension, pupillary dilatation and an increase in cardiac output and peripheral resistance. Since these changes coincided with spike discharges in the EEG, and since there was also a profuse salivation indicating augmentation of parasympathetic activity as well, endosulfan was apparently acting within the brain to increase autonomic activity. The microsphere technique revealed that the cardiac output was preferentially redistributed to the heart and the brain at the cost of the fraction going to the kidneys, lungs, muscles and large intestine. There was an increase in cerebral blood flow which was more marked in diencephalon and cerebral hemispheres.",

Endosulfan was admin in the feed at either two concn, to groups of 50 male and 50 female animals of each species. The time weighted avg high and low dietary concn of endosulfan, were, respectively, 952 and 408 ppm for the male rats, and 445 and 223 ppm for the female rats. In mice the high and low time weighted avg concn were, respectively, 6.9 and 3.5 ppm for the males and 3.9 and 2.0 ppm for the females. Twenty animals of each sex and species were placed on test as controls. The bioassay of high dose male rats was terminated at wk 82, and the bioassay of low dose male rats was determined during wk 74. After a 78 wk period of chemical admin, observation of female rats continued for 33 additional wk and observation of mice continued for 14 additional wk. At the doses admin to rats in this study endosulfan was toxic, inducing a high incidence of toxic nephropathy in both sexes and testicular atrophy in males. In both species early mortality was observed in the male groups and no conclusions concerning the carcinogenicity of endosulfan can be drawn from this part of the bioassay. However, survival among females of both species was sufficient for meaningful statistical evaluation of the incidence of late developing tumors. It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, technical grade endosulfan was not carcinogenic in female Osborne-Mendel rats or in female B6C3F1 mice.

Compared to the control, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at 0.64 mg/L, dicofol at 0.8 and 1.2 mg/L, endosulfan at 7.0 mg/L, and lindane at 14.0 mg/L all significantly decreased the population growth rate of the rotifers. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at concentrations higher than 0.16 mg/L, dicofol at concentrations higher than 0.025 mg/L, endosulfan at concentrations higher than 0.875 mg/L, and lindane at 14.0 mg/L all significantly decreased the mictic rate of the rotifers. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at 0.24 and 0.32 mg/L increased significantly the fertilization rate, but DDT at 0.64 mg/L inhibited completely the occurrence of fertilized mictic females. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at 0.32 and 0.64 mg/L, dicofol at 1.2 mg/L, and endosulfan at 7.0 mg/L all significantly decreased the ratio of ovigerous females to nonovigerous females, but the reverse was true for lindane at 7.0 mg/L. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at 0.0025 and 0.01 mg/L increased significantly the ratio of mictic females to amictic females, but the reverse was true for dicofol at 0.8 mg/L. Both population growth rate and mictic rate of the rotifers were suitable endpoints for assessing the effects of the four organochlorine insecticides on the reproduction of the rotifers, and the latter was more sensitive.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.73X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates endosulfan will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase endosulfan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Particulate-phase endosulfan will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Endosulfan may undergo direct photolysis, but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown. If released to soil, endosulfan is expected to have moderate to no mobility based upon Koc values of 350 to 19,953. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.5X10-5 atm-cu m/mole, however, adsorption to soil may attenuate volatilization. Endosulfan is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process with reported half-lives of 32 and 150 days in aerobic and anaerobic soils, respectively. If released into water, endosulfan is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Biodegradation in water is expected to be an important fate process with reported half-lives of 2 and 8 days in aerobic and anaerobic waters, respectively. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 33 hours and 16 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. Measured BCF values of 2,650 and 11,583 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process with half-lives of 9 to 533 hours in river water. Occupational exposure to endosulfan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where endosulfan is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to endosulfan primarily via ingestion of food. (SRC)",

The parenthetical numbers refer to the percentage of the applied endosulfan recovered as a metabolite. Sixteen of 28 soil fungi, 15 of 49 soil bacteria and 3 of 10 actinomycetes metabolized > 30% of the applied C-14 labeled endosulfan(2). Endosulfate was the major metabolite formed by the fungi, and endodiol was the predominant product of bacteria(2). Only a small amount of C-14 labeled carbon dioxide was detected, indicating minimal mineralization(2). Controls showed that chemical hydrolysis was only significant in a limited number of cultures. Biodegradation of alpha- and beta-endosulfan in soil-applied form, after incubation with bacterial cells for 21 days, was 62% and 45%, respectively(3).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2 days at an atmospheric concn of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Hydrolysis rate constants of 19.6X10-3 and 18.5X10-3 days-1 at pH 7 and 4.6X10-3 and 3.7X10-3 days-1 at pH 5.5 were measured for alpha-endosulfan and beta-endosulfan, respectively(2). Hydrolysis half-lives of 35.4 and 37.5 days for alpha-endosulfan and beta-endosulfan at pH 7 and 150.6 and 187.3 days for alpha-endosulfan and beta-endosulfan at pH 5.5 were calculated from these rate constants(SRC). In the presence of ferric hydroxide, a higher rate of hydrolysis was observed at pH 7 and 20 \u00b0C. In a solution of ferric hydroxide, the hydrolysis rate constants of alpha-endosulfan and beta-endosulfan were 5.73X10-2 and 4.48X10-2 days-1, respectively(2). Hydrolysis half-lives of 12.1 and 15.5 days were calculated from these rate constants for alpha-endosulfan and beta-endosulfan, respectively(SRC). Hydrolysis rate constants of 5.9X10-4 to 550X10-4 hours-1 were measured for alpha-endosulfan in water obtained from rivers in Australia(3). These rate constants correspond to hydrolysis half-lives of 13-1,174 hours(SRC). Hydrolysis rate constants of 13X10-4 to 800X10-4 hours-1 were measured for beta-endosulfan in water obtained from rivers in Australia(3). These rate constants correspond to hydrolysis half-lives of 9-533 hours(SRC). Irradiation of alpha-endosulfan in hexane solution and a dioxane-water solution of beta-endosulfan with light greater than 300 nm resulted in partial dechlorination of the isomers(4,5). Irradiation of a thin film of alpha-endosulfan and beta-endosulfan using germicidal lamps (254 nm) produced mainly endosulfandiol(6) but this may not be environmentally relevant(SRC). The alpha-hydroxy ether, lactone and ether of endosulfan were produced in lesser amounts(6). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of endosulfan with ozone has been estimated as 3.6X10-20 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 320 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(7).",

A BCF value of 11,583 was measured for endosulfan in yellow tetra fish exposed to 0.3 ug/L of endosulfan for 21 days in a flow-through aquarium(2). It was noted in both sets of experiments that endosulfan depuration by fish was rapid, with approximately 81% total endosulfan elimination within 120 hours when the fish were placed in a tank of pure water containing no endosulfan(1,2). According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF data suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC).",

After 28 days, the combined residues had concentrated 2249X and 2755X in edible tissues and whole fish, respectively(1). Mean endosulfan residues in two species of mussels exposed to the chemical for 36 days were 2.75X and 2.85X the level in water(2). Prior to 36 days, no beta-endosulfan was detected. The authors suggested this was due to the differential uptake of the isomers. Endosulfan accumulated 600X in the Pelecypod, Mytilus edulis after 50 hr(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

A mean concn of 0.1 ng/L was reported for both the alpha- and beta-endosulfan isomers in the Lower Niagara River, Canada(2). In the Rhine River, alpha- and beta-endosulfan were detected at concns of less than 0.01 ug/L(3) and in the Meuse River, Netherlands alpha-endosulfan was detected at 0.09, 0.03 and 0.01 ppb in 1969, 1970 and 1973, respectively(4). alpha-Endosulfan was detected in the Rhine River, Netherlands at 0.81 (1969), 0.40 (1970), 0.25 (1971), 0.03 (1972), 0.10 (1973), 0.02 (1974), 0.02 (1975), and 0.03 (1976) ppb(4). beta-Endosulfan was detected in the Rhine River, Netherlands at 0.24 and 0.03 ppb in 1969 and 1970, respectively(4). The detection limit in these studies was 0.01 ppb(4). alpha-Endosulfan was detected in the Rhine River, Netherlands at 0.02-0.33 ppb and beta-endosulfan was detected at 0.2-0.19 ppb(5). The concns increased the deeper the samples and the greater the amount of silt present(5). alpha-Endosulfan was reported in the Niagara River, Canada at concns of not detected-0.0204 ppb(6). Endosulfan was detected in 1 of 4 samples at a concn of 0.1 ug/L for Swedish stream waters in Apr 1985-1987(7). Of 1400 surface water samples taken across western Canada in 1973, beta-endosulfan was detected once in the Souris River, Manitoba at a concn of 0.011 ug/L(8). In 1981-85, water from the Grand River, Ontario, Canada contained endosulfan in 5 samples for 4.8% of the total with an average concn of 0.009 ug/L(9). Endosulfan was detected in 4 of 6 samples from the Segre River, Spain at 0.01 ug/L(10). Endosulfan was detected in 6 of 9 surface water samples obtained off the coast of Africa at concns of 1.3-1.9 ug/L(11). In October 2002, endosulfan was detected at a concentration of 0.01 ppm in one of 7 rivers that drain sugarcane fields in Kenya(12). Endosulfan was detected in one rainfed stream (Gotmi) out of nine total rain-fed and snow-fed streams from the Kumaun Himalayas region, India, at a concentration of 0.002 ug/L(13). Endosulfan was detected in River Sabaki (in Jan 1998) and River Tana (in July 1998) in Kenya at mean concentrations of 0.05 and <0.042 ug/L, respectively(14).",

Endosulfan was detected in the Gila River, Arizona in 1970 at a concn of 0.02 ppb(2). The mean alpha-endosulfan concn in raw water (Ohio, Alleghany, Beaver, and Monongahela Rivers) extracts of samples taken from various water treatment plants in Pennsylvania and West Virginia ranged from 0.1-0.6 ppb and maximum concns from 0.1-0.9(3). Endosulfan was detected in 9-24.5% of the samples taken from the Ohio River at concns of less than 0.1 ppb to 0.2 ppb(4). Endosulfan was detected in 16.7-44.4% of Ohio River tributaries at concns of 0.1-0.9 ppb(4). In May 1980, alpha-endosulfan was detected in Inner Harbor Navigation Canal water at Lake Pontchartrain, New Orleans, LA at an average concn of 0.8 ng/L for 8 samples at ebb tide and at concn of 3.0 and 0.9 ng/L for individual samples at flood tide(5). Endosulfan sulfate, alpha- and beta-endosulfan were detected in water samples from South Florida collected from 2002 to 2004 at concentration ranges (percent detection out of 88 total samples) of 0.22-28 (91%), 0.21-54 (81%), and 0.20-16 ng/L (75%), respectively(6).",

Endosulfan residues in treated wastewater effluents from a variety of industries were as follows: For alpha-endosulfan, aluminum forming - 17 samples, 29.4% pos, 0.01-28 ppb, 6.2 ppb avg; foundries - 2 samples, 100% pos, 5 ppb avg; nonferrous metals manufacturing - not detected-0.6 ppb, 0.2 ppb avg(2). For beta-endosulfan, foundries - 7 samples, 100% pos, 5 ppb avg; nonferrous metals manufacturing - not detected-0.2 ppb, 0.1 ppb avg; paint and ink formulation - 10 ppb max(2). Samples of urban runoff from Washington, DC and Bellevue, WA contained 0.1-0.2 ppb alpha-endosulfan(3).

Runoff samples from Presque Isle, ME contained from trace-19 ppb endosulfan (isomer unspecified)(3). Endosulfan was detected in 20% of water samples from 11 agricultural watersheds in Ontario with a mean concn of 3.7 parts per trillion and a maximum concn of 173 parts per trillion in 1975-76(4). In 1976-77, endosulfan was detected in 18.5% of the samples, with a mean concn of 2.0 parts per trillion and a maximum concn of 52 parts per trillion(5).

Bed load (detritus and sediment) and bottom material samples collected from Big Creek in Ontario in 1973 contained less than 1 to 3 and less than 0.1 to 0.7 ppb endosulfan, respectively(3). Endosulfan was detected in suspended sediment in Yawgoo Pond, RI at a concn of 5 ppb(4). alpha- Endosulfan was detected in the Rhine River, Netherlands bottom mud at 0.24-0.33 ppb, and beta-endosulfan was detected at 0.21-0.33 ppb(5). Endosulfan was detected in suspended sediment from Sheridan Creek, Ontario Canada at 15 ppm(6). alpha-Endosulfan was reported in sediment from the Niagara River, Canada at not detected-0.025 ppm and beta-endosulfan was reported at not detected-0.021 ppm(7). Endosulfan was detected in sediment from Del Puerto Creek in California at a concentration of 17.7 ng/g, with the alpha-isomer comprising about 10%, but reaching 50% in some samples(8).

Endosulfan was identified, not quantified, in 1 of 9 Colorado agricultural soil samples at 0.04 ppm(2). Endosulfan was detected in a soil from Canada (apple orchard): 0-7.5 cm depth, 0.59-4.51 ppm, 7.5-15 cm depth, not detected-0.12 ppm; Sour cherry orchard soil 0-15 cm depth not detected-0.30 ppm, 0.064 ppm avg, 15-30 cm depth not detected-0.10 ppm, 0.021 ppm avg; Sweet cherry orchard soil 0-15 cm depth not detected-0.16 ppm, 0.052 ppm avg, 15-30 cm depth not detected-0.041 ppm, 0.009 ppm avg; Peach orchard soil 0-15 cm depth 0.75-2.33 ppm, 15-30 cm depth 0.11-0.22 ppm; Peach orchard soil 0-15 cm depth not detected-4.93 ppm, 1.27 ppm avg, 15-30 cm depth not detected-0.74 ppm, 0.12 ppm avg; Vineyard soil 0-15 cm not detected-0.52 ppm, 0.07 ppm avg, 15-30 cm depth not detected-0.11 ppm, 0.02 ppm avg; Vineyard soil 0.02 avg(3). alpha- Endosulfan was detected in 1 of 65 soil samples from California at 0.01 ppm and beta-endosulfan was detected in 2 of 65 samples at 0.04-0.06 ppm(4). alpha-Endosulfan and beta-endosulfan were detected in 1 of 54 soil samples from Michigan at 0.02 ppm(4) and beta endosulfan was detected in 1 of 20 samples from New England states at 0.07 ppm (4). alpha-Endosulfan was detected in New England soil at 0.08 ppm and beta-endosulfan was detected at 0.25 ppm(5). Endosulfan was detected in farm soil in British Columbia, Canada at concns of not detected-4,716 ug/kg(6). Endosulfan was detected in 23.33% of total topsoil samples collected from 23 rice fields in Valencia, Spain, with a maximum concentration of 0.32 mg/kg(7). Endosulfan was detected in sugarcane field soil five years after application of pesticide in Kenya, at a concentration of 0.513 ppm(8). The highest levels of endosulfan found in Costa Rican soil samples from 20 sampling sites were from sites with elevations above 2500 m, with concentrations from Prusia, Irazu, Tapanti, Barva and Poas of 294, 424, 491, 3175 and 1703 pg/g dry weight, respectively(9).",

Out of 270 apple and citrus fruit samples collected from Karachi, Pakistan from 1999 to 2001, 11 apples, and 16 citrus fruits were contaminated with endosulfan at 0.05-13.07 ppm(2). Out of 206 samples of 27 different vegetables collected from Karachi, Pakistan from 2001 to 2003, endosulfan was detected one time each in sugarbeet, mint, bitterguord, french bean, Indian squash, cucumber, lady's finger, lufa, tomato and cabbage, and twice each in turnip and pumpkin; the MRL was exceeded in 7 of these samples(3). From April 1995 to March 2000, in a study of 765 total samples of agricultural products in Japan, endosulfan was detected in 6 out of 237 cucumbers, with one detection each at residue levels <0.01, <0.05 and <0.5 ug/g, and 3 detections at concentrations <0.1 ug/g(4). Out of 235 fish samples from Calcutta, analyzed between 1993-95 to 1997-98, 131 were contaminated with endosulfan residues from 0.01 to 1.41 ug/g, with about 16% above the maximum residue limit of 0.2 ug/g prescribed for meat on fat basis(5).",

The concn of residues found in living fish was less than or equal to 0.19 mg/kg wet wt in caudal muscle, and usually 0.8 mg/kg wet wt in pooled viscera (max 2.8 mg/kg). These values returned to near-normal within 3 months after cessation of spraying, but residues were still detectable after 12 months. By comparison, fish killed by spraying contained a max residue level (whole body) of 1.5 mg/kg wet wt. Lean fish were more susceptible to poisoning than fat fish. Residue levels in fish predators (fish-eating birds and crocodiles) were similar to those in their prey, and the risk to them was consequently low.",

Endosulfan has been detected in various species of African fish at concns of 0.79-14.13 mg/kg(4). Eggs of Chinook salmon collected from 15 females returning from Lake Michigan in the Fall of 1982 contained endosulfan at concn ranging from 0.6 to 27.8 ug/kg wet weight with an average of 10.9 ug/kg(5). Endosulfan was detected in the muscle tissue of common carp, Tench and Bleak fish in southern Italy at concn of 5, 5 and 8 ng/g of wet weight, respectively(6). No endosulfan residues were detected in fish samples collected from snowfed and rainfed rivers of Kumaun Himalayas(7). Endosulfan residues were below the detection limit (0.042 ng/g lipid) in fish samples collected in Jan and July 1998 from River Tana in Kenya(8).",

Twenty grams of dorsal fish muscle were extracted and the residues analyzed by GLC; reagent blanks and spike samples were included with each sample.

The NOES Survey does not include farm workers. Occupational exposure to endosulfan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where endosulfan is produced or used(SRC). The total endosulfan dermal exposure rate of workers involved in mixing insecticides for a tobacco farm located in Kentucky in 1994-1995 was 135.3 mg/hr(2). During spray applications of endosulfan on fruit orchards using air-blast equipment, a mean dermal exposure of 24.7 mg/hr (range, 0.6-95.3 mg/hr) and a mean inhalation exposure of 0.02 ng/hr (range, 0.01-0.05 ng/hr) were calculated(3). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to endosulfan via ingestion of food products contaminated with endosulfan(SRC).",

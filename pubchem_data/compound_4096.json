Its mode of action in insects and mammals is through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. This enzyme is essential in the normal transmission of nerve impulses. Methamidophos is a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It is particularly effective against chewing and sucking insects and is used to control aphids, flea beetles, worms, whiteflies, thrips, cabbage loopers, Colorado potato beetles, potato tubeworms, armyworms, mites, leafhoppers, and many others. Crop uses include broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, grapes, celery, sugar beets, cotton, tobacco, and potatoes. It is used abroad for many vegetables, hops, corn, peaches, and other crops Due to its toxicity, the use of pesticides that contain methamidophos is currently being phased out in Brazil. Methamidophos is highly toxic via oral, dermal and inhalation routes of exposure. Methamidophos was found in dumplings (gyoza) manufactured in China for the Japanese market after a number of consumers became sick.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Urine, feces and CO2 were collected twice daily and brain, kidney, liver, heart, spleen, femur bone, blood and fat were analyzed for radioactivity. For studies with the 32P-labeled test substance, groups of two male and two female Sprague Dawley rats were preconditioned for 2 weeks with 0.5 mg/kg nonradioactive Monitor technical followed by daily dosing with 0.21 mg (2.72 uC) of radiolabeled Monitor technical (32P Methamidophos, 99.5%) for 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 or 28 days. Urine and feces were collected and the distribution of radioactivity was assessed in kidney, liver, heart, muscle (from the carcass) and carcass fat. Monitor technical was rapidly degraded and/or eliminated within the first 24 hr post dosing. In the 14C studies, 60% of the radioactivity was detected in CO2 and 11% in urine. Fecal excretion of radiolabel was low. In the 32P studies, 70% of the radioactivity was detected in the urine. Fecal excretion of the 32P radiolabel was initially low (2-3%) but increased 3-21 days post dosing (8-21%). The identified metabolites in the urine (O,S-dimethyl- phosphorothioate, methyl dihydrogen phosphate and phosphoric acid) are not considered to be ChE inhibitors. The content of Monitor technical in tissue 14 days post-treatment was <0.004 ppm. There was no difference in the rate of metabolism, excretion or nature of the metabolites between males and females.",

Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.",

For the lower homologs, acetylcholinesterase was more sensitive than neuropathy target esterase and it was impossible to achieve high inhibition of neuropathy target esterase in vivo without both prophylaxis and therapy against acute anticholinesterase effects; for the n-hexyl homolog high inhibition of neuropathy target esterase could be achieved without obvious anticholinesterase effects and spontaneous reactivation of inhibited acetycholinesterase was seen as in vitro. The maximum tolerated dose of L(-) methamidophos or of the ethyl- or isopropyl homologs did not inhibit neuropathy target esterase more than 60%, and surviving birds did not develop organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy. The n-propyl, n-butyl and n-hexyl compounds caused typical organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy at doses causing a peak of 70-95% inhibition of neuropathy target esterase in brain, spinal cord and sciatic nerve soon after dosing. Racemic methamidophos caused unusually mild organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy associated with very high inhibition of neuropathy target esterase at doses estimated to be > 8 times the unprotected LD50 and the D-(+) isomer caused organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy at about 5-7 times the LD50. Clinical effects correlated with histopathology in 19 out of 20 examined birds. In contrast to results of many previous studies with organophosphates and phosphonates, all these cases of organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy were associated with formation of inhibited neuropathy target esterase which could be reactivated ex vivo by treatment of autopsy tissue with KF solution. It is not clear whether aging of inhibited neuropathy target esterase had occurred but with less associated stabilization of the enzyme-phosphorus bond or whether, even without aging, the unusual N-unsubstituted phosphoramidate caused sufficient disturbance in or near the neuropathy target esterase target to initiate the same degenerative process as that caused typically by generation of aged organophosphorylated neuropathy target esterase.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

Administer atropine sulfate intravenously, or intramuscularly if intravenous injection is not possible. ...The objective of atropine antidotal therapy is to antagonize the effects of excessive concentrations of acetylcholine at end-organs having muscarinic receptors. Atropine does not reactivate the cholinesterase enzyme or accelerate disposition of organophosphate. Recrudescence of poisoning may occur if tissue concentrations of organophosphate remain high when the effect of atropine wears off. Atropine is effective against muscarinic manifestations, but it is ineffective against nicotinic actions, specifically muscle weakness and twitching, and respiratory depression. ...However, lack of response, with no evidence of atropinization (atropine refractoriness) is typical of more severe poisonings. The adjunctive use of nebulized atropine has been reported to improve respiratory distress, decrease bronchial secretions, and increase oxygenation. ...Do not administer atropine or pralidoxime prophylactically to workers exposed to organophosphate pesticides. Prophylactic dosage with either atropine or pralidoxime may mask early signs and symptoms of organophosphate poisoning and thus allow the worker to continue exposure and possibly progress to more severe poisoning. Atropine itself may enhance the health hazards of the agricultural work setting: impaired heat loss due to reduced sweating and impaired ability to operate mechanical equipment due to blurred vision. This can be caused by mydriasis, one of the effects of atropine. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

Before administration of pralidoxime, draw a blood sample (heparinized) for cholinesterase analysis (since pralidoxime tends to reverse the cholinesterase depression). Administer pralidoxime (Protopam, 2-PAM), a cholinesterase reactivator, in cases of severe poisoning by organophosphate pesticides in which respiratory depression, muscle weakness, and/or twitching are severe. When administered early (usually less than 48 hours after poisoning) pralidoxime relieves the nicotinic as well as the muscarinic effects of poisoning. Pralidoxime works by reactivating the cholinesterase and also by slowing the \"aging\" process of phosphorylated cholinesterase to a non-reactivatable form. ... Dosage of pralidoxime may be repeated in 1-2 hours, then at 10-12 hour intervals if needed. In very severe poisonings, dosage rates may be doubled. Repeated doses of pralidoxime are usually required. In cases that involve continuing absorption of organophosphate (as after ingestion of large amounts), or continuing transfer of highly lipophilic organophosphate from fat into blood, it may be necessary to continue administration of pralidoxime for several days beyond the 48 hour post-exposure interval usually cited as the limit of its effectiveness. ... Blood pressure should be monitored during administration because of the occasional occurrence of hypertensive crisis. Administration should be slowed or stopped if blood pressure rises to hazardous levels. Be prepared to assist pulmonary ventilation mechanically if respiration is depressed during or after pralidoxime administration. If intravenous injection is not possible, pralidoxime may be given by deep intramuscular injection. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

It has been estimated that the coefficient of variation for AChE activity in samples from an individual is 8-11%, and that a decrease of 23% below pre-exposure level may, therefore, be considered significant. If the average of several pre-exposure values were available, then a decrease of 17% would be significant. It has been recommended that, if measured activity is reduced by 30% or more of the pre-exposure value, AChE measurements should be repeated at appropriate intervals to confirm the results. Depressions of AChE or ChE in excess of 20-25% are considered diagnostic of exposure but not, necessarily, indicative of hazard. Depressions of 30-50% or more are considered indicators for removal of an exposed individual from further contact with pesticides until levels return to normal. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/"

Advances in gas chromatography and combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) have made it possible to analyse the urine of exposed persons for the presence of appropriate metabolites. It is usually necessary to preserve the sample by the addition of chloroform, to concentrate or extract the metabolite(s), and to convert them to suitably-volatile derivatives that can be detected by GC. Obviously, access to a well-equipped analytical laboratory, capable of the quick processing of samples, is a necessary factor if monitoring by urine analysis is proposed. However, in some cases, simpler and sensitive colorimetric tests are available for screening the urine of exposed persons. Thus, 4-nitrophenol can be measured directly in the urine of workers exposed to parathion. Consideration of the concentration of metabolite(s) in the urine can be helpful in determining patterns of exposure, and these concentrations can be calibrated against the effects on AChE for a particular pesticide. However, the time-course and peak of excretion of metabolites appears to vary according to dose, so that serial sampling and analyses of urine are desirable. Levels of metabolite alone cannot be considered a guide to hazard. This is obvious when it is realized that pesticides that have very different toxicities may yield identical acidic metabolites. Thus, the level of metabolites in urine, after exposure to sufficient amounts of the very toxic parathion-methyl to depress blood-AChE to 50%, will be much lower than that of the identical metabolites, following exposure to the related fenitrothion, which is about 40 times less toxic. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/",

Eighty-two apparently healthy grouse were captured to quantify the effects of organophosphorus insecticides and other pesticides on sage grouse in sagebrush (Artemisia species) bordering agricultural lands in July 1985 and 1986. Grouse were fitted with radio collars and tracked through part of each summer. At least 18% of 82 radio-tagged grouse in 1985-86 subsequently occupied fields at the time they were sprayed with organophosphorus insecticide methamidophos. Cholinesterase assays of brains and residue analysis of crop contents indicated that 5 and 16% of the marked sample died from organophosphorus insecticides in 1985 and 1986, respectively. Maximum residues in crop contents of dead grouse were 18 ug/g methamidophos. Intoxicated or dead grouse were observed in or near 6 fields sprayed with methamidophos in 1985-86.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.5X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methamidophos will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase methamidophos will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours. Particulate-phase methamidophos will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, methamidophos is expected to have very high mobility based upon a Koc of 5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.7X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected, base on methamidophos' vapor pressure. Average half-lives in soil under aerobic and anaerobic conditions are 4 and 7.5 days, respectively. If released into water, methamidophos is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Half-lives for the hydrolysis of methamidiophos at 22 \u00b0C and pH 4, 7, and 9 have been reported to be 1.8 years, 120 hours, and 70 hours, respectively. Photolysis rates in water and soil are 0.0079 and 0.210 per day; corresponding to half-lives of 87 and 3.3 days, respectively. Occupational exposure to methamidophos may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methamidophos is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methamidophos via ingestion of food. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In the U.S. FDA regulatory monitoring of imported foods which may be eaten by infants/children (1985-1991), methamidophos was found in the following foods (number of findings, max concentration ppm): apple juice (1, trace), apples (1, 0.02), grape juice (1, trace), and pears (7, 0.02)(1). In the Total Diet Study (1985-1991) of infant foods, methamidophos residues were found in the following foods (number of findings, max concentration ppm): oatmeal with applesauce and bananas (1, 0.001), tomatoes, beef, and macaroni (2, 0.001), vegetable with beef (1, 0.002), green beans (21, 0.018), and mixed vegetables (3, 0.001)(1). Methamidophos residues found in the selected Total Diet Study (1985-1991) of adult foods eaten by infants/children were (number of findings, max concentration ppm) in canned apple juice (2, 0.0008), raw apples with the peel (1, 0.0009), and raw pear (1, 0.0007)(1). In an U.S. FDA study (1982-1991), which included 37 market basket studies, each containing 234 food items representing about 5000 food types in American diets covering all age groups, methamidophos was detected 427 times in 49 foods with an average concentrations of 0.0111 ug/g(2). In 1992-1993, the U.S. FDA studied the pesticide residues in domestic and imported pears and tomatoes; methamidophos was detected in 56 and 66% of domestic and imported tomatoes at maximum concentrations of 0.68 and 0.30 ppm, respectively and was not detected in pears(3). Detection of methamidophos was found to occur with a frequency of 3, 5, 6 and 5% in the U.S. FDA Total Diet Study 1982-1984, 1984-1986, 1986-1991 and 1994, respectively(4-6).",

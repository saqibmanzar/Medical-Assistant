PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The reported rate in the United States is about 1 case of liver failure resulting in death or transplant per 250,000 to 300,000 patient-years of nefazodone hydrochloride treatment. The total patient-years is a summation of each patient's duration of exposure expressed in years. For example, 1 patient-year is equal to 2 patients each treated for 6 months, 3 patients each treated for 4 months, etc. Ordinarily, treatment with nefazodone hydrochloride tablets should not be initiated in individuals with active liver disease or with elevated baseline serum transaminases. There is no evidence that pre-existing liver disease increases the likelihood of developing liver failure, however, baseline abnormalities can complicate patient monitoring.  Patients should be advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction (jaundice, anorexia, gastrointestinal complaints, malaise, etc.) and to report them to their doctor immediately if they occur.  Nefazodone hydrochloride tablets should be discontinued if clinical signs or symptoms suggest liver failure. Patients who develop evidence of hepatocellular injury such as increased serum AST or serum ALT levels >/= 3 times the upper limit of NORMAL, while on nefazodone hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn from the drug. These patients should be presumed to be at increased risk for liver injury if nefazodone hydrochloride is reintroduced. Accordingly, such patients should not be considered for re-treatment.",

The breast-fed white infant (female, 2.1 kg, 36 weeks corrected gestational age) of a 35-year-old woman (60 kg) taking nefazodone 300 mg/day was admitted to the hospital because she was drowsy, lethargic, unable to maintain normal body temperature, and was feeding poorly. A diagnosis of exposure to nefazodone via breast milk was considered only after other more likely diagnoses had been excluded. ... The maternal plasma and milk concentration-time profiles for nefazodone and its metabolites, triazoledione, HO-nefazodone, and m-chlorphenylpiperazine, were quantified by HPLC.

The breast-fed white infant (female, 2.1 kg, 36 weeks corrected gestational age) of a 35-year-old woman (60 kg) taking nefazodone 300 mg/day was admitted to the hospital because she was drowsy, lethargic, unable to maintain normal body temperature, and was feeding poorly. ... The maternal plasma and milk concentration-time profiles for nefazodone and its metabolites, triazoledione, HO-nefazodone, and m-chlorphenylpiperazine, were quantified by HPLC. The calculated infant dose for nefazodone and its active metabolites (as nefazodone equivalents) via the milk was only 0.45% of the weight-adjusted maternal nefazodone daily dose. ...",

The chromatographic conditions were purposefully chosen to reflect those utilized in high-throughput screening for microsomal stability of new chemical entities. Molecular ion, retention time information on groups of human liver microsomal samples with/without nefazodone was evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA). Resultant scores and loadings plots from the PCA revealed the segregation and the ions of interest that designated the drug and its corresponding metabolites. Subsequent acquisition of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra for targeted ions permitted the interrogation and interpretation of spectra to identify nefazodone and its metabolites. A comparison of nefazodone metabolites identified by PCA versus those found by traditional metabolite identification approaches resulted in very good correlation when utilizing similar analytical methods. Fifteen metabolites of nefazodone were identified in beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-supplemented human liver microsomal incubations, representing nearly all primary metabolites previously reported. Of the 15 metabolites, eight were derived from the N-dealkylation and N-dephenylation of the N-substituted 3-chlorophenylpiperazine motif in nefazodone, six were derived from mono- and bis-hydroxylation, and one was derived from the Baeyer Villiger oxidation of the ethyltriazolone moiety in nefazodone.",

Two new metabolic pathways (biotransformation) for NEF have been discovered by the characterization of three new metabolites, including two new metabolites (M24, M25) formed due to the N-dealkylation reaction that occurred between the triazolone and propyl units, and one new metabolite (M26) formed due to the O-dearylation reaction that occurred on the phenoxyethyl unit. These metabolites were initially detected by a 4000 Q-Trap instrument and then confirmed by exact mass measurement using an LTQ-Orbitrap. Both instruments proved to be capable of providing complete in vitro metabolite information in a single liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis, although each had its advantages and disadvantages. One noticeable disadvantage of the 4000 Q-Trap was the reduced quality of isotopic pattern in the enhanced mass scan (EMS) spectrum when it was used as survey scan to trigger multiple dependent product ion scans. The problem was especially exacerbated for minor metabolites with low signal intensity. On the other hand, the LTQ-Orbitrap maintained excellent isotopic pattern when used as a full scan survey scan. Twenty-six metabolites were detected and identified. The formation of these new metabolites was also confirmed by analyzing duplicate incubations at different time points.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

These mechanisms increase the amount of serotonin available to interact with 5-HT receptors. Within the noradrenergic system, nefazodone inhibits norepinephrine uptake minimally. Nefazodone also antagonizes alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, producing sedation, muscle relaxation, and a variety of cardiovascular effects. Nefazodone's affinity for benzodiazepine, cholinergic, dopaminergic, histaminic, and beta or alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors is not significant.",

HUMAN STUDIES: In postmarketing experience, overdose with nefazodone alone and in combination with alcohol and/or other substances has been reported. While there have been rare reports of fatalities in patients taking overdoses of nefazodone, predominantly in combination with alcohol and/or other substances, no causal relationship to nefazodone has been established. In premarketing clinical studies, there were seven reports of nefazodone overdose alone or in combination with other pharmacological agents. None of these patients died. The amount of nefazodone ingested ranged from 1000 mg to 11,200 mg. Commonly reported symptoms from overdose of nefazodone included nausea, vomiting, and somnolence. One patient took 2000 to 3000 mg of nefazodone with methocarbamol and alcohol, and this person reportedly experienced a convulsion. Nefazodone therapy has been associated with liver abnormalities ranging from asymptomatic reversible serum transaminase increases to cases of liver failure resulting in transplant and/or death. At present, there is no way to predict who is likely to develop liver failure. Ordinarily, patients with active liver disease should not be treated with nefazodone. The drug does not increase the rates of major human malformations during pregnancy above the baseline rate of 1% to 3%. ANIMAL STUDIES: There is no evidence of carcinogenicity with nefazodone. The dietary administration of nefazodone to rats and mice for 2 years at daily doses of up to 200 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg, respectively, produced no increase in tumors. Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rabbits and rats at daily doses up to 200 and 300 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 6 and 5 times, respectively. No malformations were observed in the offspring as a result of nefazodone treatment. However, increased early pup mortality, and decreased pup weights were seen in rats. A fertility study in rats showed a slight decrease in fertility at 200 mg/kg/day. Nefazodone has been shown to have no genotoxic effects based on the following assays: bacterial mutation assays, a DNA repair assay in cultured rat hepatocytes, a mammalian mutation assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, an in vivo cytogenetics assay in rat bone marrow cells, and a rat dominant lethal study.",

These mechanisms increase the amount of serotonin available to interact with 5-HT receptors. Within the noradrenergic system, nefazodone inhibits norepinephrine uptake minimally. Nefazodone also antagonizes alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, producing sedation, muscle relaxation, and a variety of cardiovascular effects. Nefazodone's affinity for benzodiazepine, cholinergic, dopaminergic, histaminic, and beta or alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors is not significant.",

Soon after its general availability, nefazodone was linked to several instances of acute, clinically apparent liver injury, some of which were fatal. The onset of injury varied from 6 weeks to 8 months and the pattern of serum enzyme elevations was typically hepatocellular. Autoimmune (autoantibodies) and immunoallergic features (rash, fever, eosinophilia) were uncommon. Liver biopsy usually demonstrated an acute hepatitis with cholestasis and variable degrees of centrolobular (zone 3) necrosis. Systematic reviews suggested that the incidence of hepatic failure due to nefazodone is 1 per 250,000 to 300,000 patient-years of exposure. Because of this complication, nefazodone was withdrawn from use in many countries. Nefazodone, however, can be effective in patients with otherwise resistant forms of severe depression. For this reason, it remains available in the United States with the recommendation that it be used only if other antidepressants have been found to be ineffective and after full disclosure and discussion of the risks. It has a \u201cblack box\u201d warning for hepatotoxicity.",

A brand name for nefazodone is Serzone\u00ae.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.Some people may have a return of their symptoms (relapse) if they stop this medication. Untreated mental illness might also affect a pregnancy. For more information, see the fact sheet on Depression at https://mothertobaby.org/fact-sheets/depression-pregnancy/. If you plan to stop this medication, your healthcare provider may suggest that you slowly lower the dose instead of stopping all at once. Stopping this medication suddenly can cause some people to have withdrawal symptoms. It is not known if or how withdrawal might affect a pregnancy.",

It is a safe and effective medication in most patients when used appropriately. A serious side effect known as rhabdomyolysis may rarely occur in patients who take simvastatin, especially at higher doses and with agents that interact and increase the level of simvastatin in the blood. We describe the case of a patient with rhabdomyolysis that occurred after the patient's simvastatin was titrated to 80 mg at approximately the same time that his antidepressant medication was switched to nefazodone. We found only two other similar cases in the literature, both of which were presented as letters to the editor in two different journals. We present this case to add to the literature and to assist practitioners by raising their awareness of this interaction so that it can be monitored.",

A group of 12 subjects received either placebo twice daily, 1 mg of alprazolam twice daily, 200 mg of nefazodone twice daily, or the combination of 1 mg of alprazolam and 200 mg of nefazodone twice daily for 7 days. Serial blood samples were collected after dosing on day 1 and day 7 and before the morning dose on days 4, 5, and 6 for the determination of alprazolam and its metabolites alpha-hydroxyalprazolam (AOH) and 4-hydroxyalprazolam (4OH) and nefazodone and its metabolites hydroxynefazodone (HO-nefazodone), m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), and a triazole dione metabolite (dione) by validated high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Steady-state levels in plasma were reached by day 4 for alprazolam, 4OH, nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, mCPP, and dione. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis showed that at steady state, alprazolam Cmax and AUCtau values significantly increased approximately twofold and 4OH Cmax and AUCtau values significantly decreased by 40 and 26%, respectively, when nefazodone was coadministered with alprazolam. There was no effect of alprazolam on the single-dose or steady-state pharmacokinetics of nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, or dione after the coadministration of alprazolam and nefazodone. However, the mean steady-state mCPP Cmax and AUCtau significantly increased by approximately threefold and t1/2 values significantly increased by approximately twofold after the coadministration of alprazolam and nefazodone in comparison to those when nefazodone was given alone. Competitive inhibition between alprazolam and nefazodone metabolism at cytochrome P450 3A4 may be responsible for the pharmacokinetic interaction when alprazolam and nefazodone were coadministered. No adjustment of nefazodone dosage is required when nefazodone and alprazolam are coadministered. Because alprazolam concentrations in plasma are increased in the presence of nefazodone, a reduction in alprazolam dosage is recommended when the two agents are coadministered.",

A 57-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease presumed secondary to chronic glomerulonephritis underwent a living related renal allograft transplantation. She tolerated the surgery well and was discharged on postoperative day 5. She was stabilized with prednisone, azathioprine, and tacrolimus. Two years after transplantation, nefazodone 50 mg twice/day orally was prescribed due to depression. After 1 week of nefazodone therapy the patient experienced headache, confusion, and \"gray areas\" in her vision, without abnormal ophthalmologic findings. Her serum creatinine was elevated to 2.2 mg/dL (baseline 1.5 mg/dL), and trough tacrolimus level was markedly elevated (> 30 ng/mL). Both tacrolimus and nefazodone are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 system. We suspect that nefazodone inhibits metabolism of tacrolimus. Coadministration of antidepressant agents such as nefazodone, or any other drug that inhibits the CYP3A4 isoenzyme subfamily, should be anticipated to interfere with tacrolimus metabolism. Monitoring blood concentrations of tacrolimus is vital, and appropriate dosage adjustments are required when the two drugs are administered concurrently to avoid serious interactions such as nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity.",

Many of the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are metabolized by the same cytochrome P450IIIA isoenzyme system that is responsible for the metabolism of cyclosporine, and these agents pose an interactive risk in transplant patients. We have observed nearly a 10-fold increase in whole blood cyclosporine concentrations in a cardiac transplant patient shortly after the addition of nefazodone antidepressant therapy. We suggest there is a clinically significant drug-drug interaction between nefazodone and cyclosporine due to inhibition of cytochrome P-450 IIIA4 isoenzymes by nefazodone.",

The reported rate in the United States is about 1 case of liver failure resulting in death or transplant per 250,000 to 300,000 patient-years of nefazodone hydrochloride treatment. The total patient-years is a summation of each patient's duration of exposure expressed in years. For example, 1 patient-year is equal to 2 patients each treated for 6 months, 3 patients each treated for 4 months, etc. Ordinarily, treatment with nefazodone hydrochloride tablets should not be initiated in individuals with active liver disease or with elevated baseline serum transaminases. There is no evidence that pre-existing liver disease increases the likelihood of developing liver failure, however, baseline abnormalities can complicate patient monitoring.  Patients should be advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction (jaundice, anorexia, gastrointestinal complaints, malaise, etc.) and to report them to their doctor immediately if they occur.  Nefazodone hydrochloride tablets should be discontinued if clinical signs or symptoms suggest liver failure. Patients who develop evidence of hepatocellular injury such as increased serum AST or serum ALT levels = 3 times the upper limit of NORMAL, while on nefazodone hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn from the drug. These patients should be presumed to be at increased risk for liver injury if nefazodone hydrochloride is reintroduced. Accordingly, such patients should not be considered for re-treatment.",

One nonstudy participant took 2000 to 3000 mg of nefazodone with methocarbamol and alcohol; this person reportedly experienced a convulsion (type not documented). None of these patients died.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.2X10-11 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates nefazodone will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase nefazodone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Nefazodone does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, nefazodone is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 1.0X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-17 atm-cu m/mole. Nefazodone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, nefazodone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to nefazodone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where nefazodone is produced or used. The general public is not likely to be exposed to nefazodone unless by direct medical treatment. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

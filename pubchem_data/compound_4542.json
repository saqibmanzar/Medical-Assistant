PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

In 2 prospective, randomized studies, nausea and vomiting were less common with a high-dose postcoital progestin-only regimen (0.75 mg levonorgestrel every 12 hours for 2 doses) than with a high-dose estrogen-progestin regimen (100 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 0.5 mg levonorgestrel every 12 hours for 2 doses). Other adverse GI effects include vomiting, abdominal cramps, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Gingivitis and dry socket have also been reported. Changes in appetite and changes in weight also may occur. /Estrogen-Progestin Combination/",

The metabolites excreted in the urine were much less polar than those following the administration of the related compounds, norethisterone or lynestrenol. The 3alphaOH,5beta and 3betaOH,5beta isomers of the tetrahydronorgestrel (13beta-ethyl-17alpha-ethynyl-5 beta-gonane-3alpha,17beta-diol) were isolated from urine and identified by mass spectrometry and thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography. Plasma radioactivity decreased more rapidly than after the administration of norethisterone and lynestrenol. About 2% of the administered dose was converted to acidic compounds. There was no apparent difference in the rate of excretion of radioactivity or in the metabolites after either oral or intravenous administration of norgestrel.",

Only 19-nortestosterone derivates had any significant ability to displace testosterone from SHBG, d-norgestrel (d-Ng) being the strongest displacer. Increasing the SHBG levels in women with previous constant plasma d-Ng levels increased these levels two- to sixfold. It is concluded that SHBG is the main carrier protein for d-Ng. The strong testosterone displacing activity of d-Ng might also explain androgenic side effects observed with d-Ng containig oral contraceptives.",

The 3alphaOH,5beta and 3betaOH,5beta isomers of the tetrahydronorgestrel (13beta-ethyl-17alpha-ethynyl-5 beta-gonane-3alpha,17beta-diol) were isolated from urine and identified by mass spectrometry and thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography.

Total (14)C excretion in urine after a single oral dose of (14)C-dl-norgestrel (1 mg/kg) was significantly higher (51.4 +/- 5.0%) than that observed after administration of the d-enantiomer (37.5 +/- 5.4%) but not the l-enantiomer (44.2 +/- 8.9%). In all cases, the major part of the urinary radioactivity was present in a free fraction (48-62%), while an additional 13-27% was released by beta-glucuronidase preparations. No sulfate conjugates were detected. At least one major (16beta-hydroxylation) and one minor (16alpha-hydroxylation) metabolic pathway were stereoselective, i.e., they are operative with the I-but not the d-enantiomer. Three metabolites, 16beta-hydroxynorgestrel, 16alpha-hydroxynorgestrel, and 16-hydroxytetrahydronorgestrel (believed to be 16beta) were only detected in urine samples obtained from (14)C-dland -l-norgestrel-dosed animals. Following (14)C-d-norgestrel administration, 3alpha, 5beta-tetrahydronorgestrel was found to be the major urinary metabolite. These observations are compared with those reported earlier on the urinary metabolites of dl-norgestrel in women.",

The metabolism of the biologically active l-norgestrel was more rapid than that of d-norgestrel (sic.) which is biologically inactive. This was mainly due to the more ready conversion of l-norgestrel to ring-A reduced metabolites. There was no difference between the two isomers in respect of the amount undergoing hydroxylation; about 40% of each isomer was converted to hydroxylated metabolites after 30 min incubation. However, there were differences between the isomers, l-norgestrel being converted mainly to the 16beta-hydroxysteroid and d-norgestrel to the 16alpha-hydroxysteroid. Similar amounts of both isomers were hydroxylated at C-6. The metabolism of the racemic mixture was intermediate between that of the d and l isomers.",

Less than 5% of l-norgestrel was metabolized. In all cases the reaction product was the tetrahydrosteroid. Lynestrenol was metabolised through norethisterone. Skeletal muscle, lung and small intestine also metabolized norethisterone and d-norgestrel but at a slower rate than liver tissue.

This was done because the gastrointestinal mucosa of humans is known to metabolize a number of drugs. Almost 40% of the ethinyl estradiol, 9.8% of the levonorgestrel, and 7% of the mestranol were metabolized after incubation. All these metabolic responses were significantly different from those in the control groups. Results of the study show that the metabolism of the ethinyl estradiol was related to the weight of the tissue used. These results are consistent with the known marked 1st pass effect of ethinyl estradiol. Norgestrel, known to have little or no 1st pass effect, did not show a high rate of gut metabolism. Under the experimental conditions employed, no Phase 1 metabolism of either ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel was apparent.",

Estrogens are known to stimulate the growth of human breast cancer cells, and /it/ has previously reported that the 19-norprogestin norethindrone could stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. /Investigators/ studied the influence of the 19-norprogestins norgestrel and gestodene compared to a 'non' 19-norprogestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on MCF-7 cell proliferation. The 19-norprogestins stimulated proliferation at a concentration of 10(-8) M, while MPA could not stimulate proliferation at concentrations as great as 3 x 10(-6) M. The stimulatory activity of the 19-norprogestins could be blocked by the antioestrogen ICI 164,384, but not by the antiprogestin RU486. Transfection studies with the reporter plasmids containing an estrogen response element or progesterone response element (vitERE-CAT, pS2ERE-CAT, and PRE15-CAT) were performed to determine the intracellular action of norgestrel and gestodene. The 19-norprogestins stimulated the vitERE-CAT activity maximally at 10(-6) M, and this stimulation was inhibited by the addition of ICI 164,384. MPA did not stimulate vitERE-CAT activity. A single base pair alteration in the palindromic sequence of vitERE (resulting in the pS2ERE) led to a dramatic decrease in CAT expression by the 19-norprogestins, suggesting that the progestin activity required specific response element base sequencing. PRE15-CAT activity was stimulated by norgestrel, gestodene and MPA at concentrations well below growth stimulatory activity. This stimulation could be blocked by RU486. These studies suggest that the 19-norprogestins norgestrel and gestodene stimulate MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth by activating the estrogen receptor.",

Neither fasting blood glucose nor glucose tolerance are altered during administration of the contraceptive steroids. Conversely, the reactive insulin level is significantly increased in comparison to the basal value, thus showing the signs of hyperinsulinemia. Both the gestagens and the estrogens appear to contribute to this disturbance of insulin secretion. Presumably the hyperinsulinemia is an expression of decreased sensitivity of the peripheral tissue to insulin. The growth hormone, a so-called insulin antagonist, is not responsible for the insulin resistance observed. The values measured after administration of the contraceptive do not significantly differ from the basal values.",

Presented is the case of a 45-year-old US woman with right lower quadrant pain and a 5-year history of use of a combined oral contraceptive (OC) containing 0.35 ug ethinyl estradiol and 0.35 ug norgestrel. At presentation, the uterus was enlarged to a size corresponding to 12-14 gestational weeks, with a mass at the right fundal margin. Pelvic ultrasonography revealed a large dominant leiomyoma 7.2 x 5.8 x 5.5 cm and several smaller tumors. OC use was discontinued and, 4 months later, the uterus was a size of 8-10 gestational weeks and a single serosal leiomyoma 5.9 x 4.6 x 4.4 cm remained. The leiomyoma volume had decreased by 47% after OC discontinuation, to 63 cu cm. Pelvic sonography 12 months after OC discontinuation revealed no further changes in myoma volume. In OC users with clinically significant uterine leiomyomas, discontinuation of combined OCs should be considered as a low-risk intervention with the potential to decrease uterine volume.",

The urticaria was not adequately controlled by antihistamines or Prempak-C (conjugated oestrogens and norgestrel). Intradermal testing with progesterone was strongly positive at 30 min and 18 hr. Buserelin, administered intranasally at doses of up to 800 ug daily, controlled the urticaria within 4 weeks, and she was completely symptom-free thereafter. She had therapy-induced amenorrhea and occasional hot flushes. Unfortunately, her liver cysts progressively enlarged, and a right hepatectomy was performed in June 1992, but she died after complications 3 weeks later. Prior to this she had been free of urticaria for 6 months after starting buserelin. Buserelin, a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue, may be useful in the management of progesterone-induced urticaria, in patients in whom conjugated estrogens are contraindicated or unhelpful.",

B3C6F1 mice were given 5 IU PMSG followed by 5 IU hCG 48 hr later. Studies were performed on pre-embryos recovered and pooled at both 24 hr (Group A) and 48 hr (Group B) post hCG. At each time period, they were randomly assigned to control or norgestrel (4.0 ng/mL) treatment. In a third study, pre-embryos collected 24 hr post hCG were cultured in the absence or presence of 8.0, 80.0, or 800 ng/mL norgestrel. Cultures were performed in Ham's F-10 media with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% O2 and 90% N2 with 15-30 embryos per 1 mL of culture fluid. At 24 hr, 48 hr and 72 hr post recovery, cultures were viewed, the appearance of embryos noted, and number of blastomeres recorded. Compared to control groups, analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the rate of development of control and norgestrel pre-embryos in any group at any time period (24 hr, 48 hr, or 72 hr post recovery). /The authors/ conclude that norgestrel at the dose tested has no acute adverse morphological effects on development of mouse pre-embryos. This observation has potential clinical implications with regard to inadvertent use of norgestrel-containing oral contraceptives during early days of pregnancy, as well as consideration of the mechanism of action of norgestrel-containing \"morning after\" pills.",

In women who are myopic and have considerable astigmatism, oral contraceptives may produce marked changes in the astigmatic error, possibly leading to frank keratoconus. In addition, oral contraceptives may produce a rapid advancement of the ocular disorder in patients with a family history of marked myopic astigmatism or keratoconus. Contact lens wearers receiving estrogen-progestin contraceptives may have more difficulties with their contact lenses than do nonusers who wear contact lenses. Contact lens wearers who develop visual disturbances or changes in lens tolerance during estrogen-progestin contraceptive use should be assessed by an ophthalmologist; temporary or permanent cessation of contact lens wear should be considered. /Estrogen-Progestin Combination/"

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.0X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates norgestrel will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase norgestrel will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Norgestrel contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, norgestrel is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8,100. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.7X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Norgestrel is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, norgestrel is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 91 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to norgestrel may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where norgestrel is produced or used. Exposure to norgestrel among the general population may be limited to women administered the drug, a contraceptive. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

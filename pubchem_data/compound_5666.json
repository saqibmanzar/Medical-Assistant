For decades, an immediate-release formulation of viloxazine has been used in Europe as an antidepressant. It was first approved in the UK in 1974; however, the immediate-release formulation was discontinued due to business reasons unrelated to drug safety and efficacy. In the US, viloxazine was assigned an orphan drug designation in 1984 under the brand name CATATROL: while this product was intended to treat cataplexy and narcolepsy, the drug was never approved for these therapeutic indications. In April 2021, an extended-release formulation of viloxazine under the brand name QELBREE was approved by the FDA for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

In current literature, the pathophysiology of ADHD is understood to involve the imbalance of neurotransmitters, especially dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). The mechanism of action of viloxazine has not been fully elucidated; however, viloxazine is believed to work by modulating the monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Viloxazine is a selective and moderate norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that binds to the norepinephrine transporter and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine. It thereby increases extracellular norepinephrine levels across several brain regions.  Viloxazine potentiates serotonergic effects: it was shown to enhance neuronal sensitivity to serotonin and increase serotonin levels in the brain. _In vitro_, viloxazine is an antagonist at 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors and an agonist 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors expressed on GABAergic interneurons are involved in tonic inhibitory control of serotonin neurons that innervate the medial prefrontal context; thus, antagonism of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors may result in disinhibition and enhanced serotonin release in the brain region.   There is conflicting evidence in the literature that viloxazine increases dopamine levels in the brain via direct or indirect effects. For example, the norepinephrine transporter is also involved in the reuptake of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and stimulation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors facilitates DA release and enhances dopaminergic transmission in the brain. As dopamine dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is implicated in ADHD pathophysiology, the impact of viloxazine on dopamine levels may contribute to its mechanism of action. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude this. Viloxazine has a negligible impact on dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and is not associated with an abuse risk.",

Since its approval as therapy for depression in Europe more than 30 years ago and as therapy of ADHD in the United States in 2021, there have been no publications describing clinically apparent liver injury due to viloxazine. Furthermore, summaries of the efficacy and safety of viloxazine do not mention hepatic adverse events. Nevertheless, long term clinical experience with viloxazine in children is limited, and other SNRIs (such as atomoxetine) have been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

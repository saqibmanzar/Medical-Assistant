When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Hepatocyte cytotoxicity induced by trenimon (250 microM) under aerobic conditions ensued following an initial induction of cyanide-resistant respiration and partial oxidation of glutathione to oxidized glutathione. Trenimon reduction to the hydroquinone by the hepatocytes was rapid. Inhibition of hepatocyte DT-diaphorase by dicumarol increased trenimon-induced cytotoxicity by approximately 10-fold, and markedly inhibited hydroquinone formation. Both cyanide-resistant respiration and oxidized glutathione formation were markedly increased, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the media. Trenimon reduction to the hydroquinone then occurred. ... Hepatocyte cytotoxicity induced by trenimon (350 microM) under hypoxic conditions ensued following glutathione depletion without oxidized glutathione formation. Inactivation of hepatocyte DT-diaphorase by dicumarol under hypoxic conditions increased trenimon-induced cytotoxicity by approximately 3.5-fold and increased semiquinone radical levels 2-fold without affecting its reduction rate.",

The L5178Y/HBM10 cells are reported to have a 24-fold increased level of DT-diaphorase activity over the parental cells. Inhibition of DT-diaphorase by dicoumarol markedly inhibited the cytotoxic activity of trenimon to the resistant L5178Y/HBM10 cells. Spectrophotometric analysis of the reduction of the quinone, trenimon, to its hydroquinone form was shown to occur approximately 25 times more rapidly in the L5178Y/HBM10 cells relative to the parental cells and was inhibited by discoumarol. Trenimon also induced continuous cyanide-resistant respiration in the L5178Y cells, but not in the resistant L5178Y/HBM10 cells.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.4X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates triaziquone will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase triaziquone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 hours. A half-life of 3.3 days was estimated for the reaction of vapor-phase triaziquone with ozone. Particulate-phase triaziquone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, triaziquone is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 20. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.3X10-16 atm-cu m/mole. Triaziquone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. If released into water, triaziquone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Aziridine has a hydrolysis half-life of 154 days at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C; since triaziquone contains aziridine groups, hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate for triaziquone. Occupational exposure to triaziquone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where triaziquone is produced or used. However, exposure may be limited since triaziquone was not produced commercially in the US (as of 1975); it has been produced for research purposes and was manufactured in West Germany. Exposure would be expected to be limited to individuals receiving triaziquone as drug for cancer treatment. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase triaziquone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of triaziquone with ozone has been estimated as 3.5X10-18 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(4). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3.3 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(5). Particulate-phase triaziquone may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that triaziquone is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water surfaces(2). Triaziquone's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected(SRC). Triaziquone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 3.4X10-6 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3).",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Both 2- and 4-chloroaniline-derived radioactivity were primarily renally excreted with <1% excretion in the feces by 24 hr post-treatment. Both chloroanilines accumulated mainly in liver (percentage of administered dose/total tissue), but kidney generally had similar or higher equivalent concentrations (umol/g tissue) compared to liver. Subcellular distribution revealed that for both chloroanilines, the cytosolic fraction generally had the highest level of radioactivity independent of time or dose. Covalent binding was detected in both liver and kidney, with the highest concentration (pmol/mg protein) of binding observed in the hepatic microsomal fraction regardless of compound, dose or time studied. In general, 2-chloroaniline derived radioactivity was excreted faster, reached peak tissue concentrations earlier, disappeared from tissues faster and had less covalent binding in target tissue at 24 hr than 4-chloroaniline-derived radioactivity.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

Groups of 20, 24-hr old Daphnia magna Straus were exposed to 0.001 to 3.16 mg/L 2-chloroaniline in semi-static test vessels. Parent animals in the test and control vessels had to be pipetted 3 times/wk in freshly prepared test and control media at the corresponding concentration level. The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) was determined from the parameters of mortality of the parent animals, reproduction rate and appearance of the first offspring during the test period. In preliminary acute Daphnia tests, the 24-hr EC50 was 6.0 mg/L for 2-chloroaniline, the EC0 was 1.4 mg/L. The nominal 21-day no observed effect concentration was 0.032 mg/L.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.20 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-chloroaniline will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-chloroaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours. 2-Chloroaniline absorbs ultraviolet light above 290 nm, indicating that direct environmental photolysis is possible. If released to soil, 2-chloroaniline is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 260. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower is some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil may attenuate volatilization. The pKa of 2-chloroaniline is 2.66, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in its nonionic form in the environment. 2-Chloroaniline is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation screening tests suggest that 2-chloroaniline is slightly to non-biodegradable. When 2-chloroaniline (30 ppm) was incubated in Guelph loam with water added to 60% water-holding capacity, levels declined rapidly for two weeks after which time the rate of loss decreased. The percent of 2-chloroaniline remaining after 2 and 8 weeks were 40 and 20%, respectively. If released into water, 2-chloroaniline is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. In addition, 2-chloroaniline may undergo chemical bonding with humic materials in the water column and in the sediment. Biodegradation screening tests suggest that 2-chloroaniline is generally resistant to biodegradation or biodegrades slowly in water. 2-Chloroaniline (2 mg/L) was found to be not readily biodegradable with a 10% BOD observed after 5 days in a mixed inoculum of river water collected from the Songhua River in China. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.8 days and 60 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 5.8 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that readily hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Irradiation of an aqueous solution of 2-chloroaniline in a quartz tube with a fluorochemical lamp (wavelengths above 300 nm) resulted in a photodegradation half-life of 11.5 hours. Occupational exposure to 2-chloroaniline may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-chloroaniline is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-chloroaniline via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water containing this compound. (SRC)",

However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). The pKa of 2-chloroaniline is 2.66(6), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in its nonionic form in the environment. Volatilization of 2-chloroaniline from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.20 mm Hg(7), and water solubility, 8.2X10+3 mg/L(8). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). 2-Chloroaniline is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.20 mm Hg(7). Biodegradation screening tests suggest that 2-chloroaniline is slightly  to non-biodegradable(9,10). 100% loss of UV absorbance by microbial degradation in a mineral salts solution, with a soil inoculum, required an excess of 64 days(11). When 2-chloroaniline (3-ppm) was incubated in Guelph loam with water added to 60% water-holding capacity, levels declined rapidly for 2 weeks after which time the rate of loss decreased(12). The percent of 2-chloroaniline remaining in soil after 2 and 8 weeks were 40 and 20%, respectively(12). Experiments using 2-chloroaniline show that it undergoes photolysis in aqueous solution when irradiated by light with wavelengths above 290 nm (13,14); 2-chloroaniline may also be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight in soil surfaces(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.20 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 8.2X10+3 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.8 days and 60 days, respectively(SRC). However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic group(6,7), and volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The pKa of 2-chloroaniline is 2.66(8), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in its nonionic form in the environment. According to a classification scheme(9), an estimated BCF of 5.8(SRC), from an estimated log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(10), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation screening tests suggest that 2-chloroaniline is generally resistant to biodegradation or biodegrades slowly(11,12). 2-Chloroaniline (2 mg/L) was found to be not readily biodegradable with a 10% BOD observed after 5 days in a mixed inoculum of river water collected from the Songhua River in China(13). Irradiation of an aqueous solution of 2-chloroaniline in a quartz tube with a fluorochemical lamp (wavelengths above 300 nm) resulted in a photodegradation half-life of 11.5 hours(14). When aqueous solutions of 2.5X10-3 mol/L 2-chloroaniline in a photochemical reactor were irradiated by a mercury lamp (wavelengths 254, 297, and 365 nm), the concentration of 2-chloroaniline decreased exponentially with time, and the rate of disappearance approximated a first-order process with a rate constant of 0.107/hour(15).",

Vapor-phase 2-chloroaniline is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 2-Chloroaniline absorbs ultraviolet light above 290 nm(4). Experiments using 2-chloroaniline show that it undergoes photolysis in aqueous solution when irradiated by light with wavelengths above 290 nm (5,6); 2-chloroaniline may also be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight in air(SRC).",

Only 2.7% of the 2-chloroaniline (100 ppm) degraded in a 2-week period in the MITI test(2). A 36% BODT was measured over a 190 hour incubation period with a Warburg respirometer(3). Half-lives greatly in excess of 4 weeks in both adapted and non-adapted inoculum were observed using the Repetitive Die Away (semistatic system) and Pitter (dynamic system) tests(4). No biodegradation was observed using modified procedures of the OECD and MITI test methods(5,6). Results of standard biodegradation tests were reported as follows: Coupled units, 5-6% DOC removal; Zahn-Wellens, 94% DOC removal; MITI, 0% BODT; Sturm, 0% CO2 evolution, 9% DOC removal; Closed bottle, 0% BODT(7). Another investigator obtained 85% DOC removal in 11 days in the Zahn-Wellens test(8). 2-Chloroaniline (2 mg/L) was found to be not readily biodegradable with a 10% BOD observed after 5 days in a mixed inoculum of river water collected from the Songhua River in China(9). Incubation of 2-chloroaniline in soil for 14 days resulted in formation of dichloroazobenzene, but no dichloroazobenzene was formed using sterilized soil(10). 100% loss of UV absorbance by microbial degradation in a mineral salts solution, with a soil inoculum, required an excess of 64 days(11). When 2-chloroaniline (3 ppm) was incubated in Guelph loam with water added to 60% water-holding capacity, levels declined rapidly for 2 weeks after which time the rate of loss decreased(12). The percent of 2-chloroaniline remaining in soil after 2 and 8 weeks were 40 and 20%, respectively(12).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 12 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 2-Chloroaniline is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of readily hydrolyzable functional groups(2). 2-Chloroaniline absorbs ultraviolet light above 290 nm(3). Irradiation of an aqueous solution of 2-chloroaniline in a quartz tube with a fluorochemical lamp (wavelengths above 300 nm) resulted in a photodegradation half-life of 11.5 hours(4). When aqueous solutions of 2.5X10-3 mol/L 2-chloroaniline in a photochemical reactor were irradiated by a mercury lamp (wavelengths 254, 297, and 365 nm), the concentration of 2-chloroaniline decreased exponentially with time, and the rate of disappearance approximated a first-order process with a rate constant of 0.107/hour(5).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

Uptake was rapid in static tests (0.19 umol/L, 26 \u00b0C) on zebrafish and a BCF of 15.3 was obtained for 24 hour exposure(2). Log BCF of 2-chloroaniline in fish were experimentally determined to be less than 2.0 using the Japanese MITI test procedures(3). In an 8-week test performed at two concentration levels, the BCF of 2-chloroaniline in carp was 5.4-9.0 (0.1 ppm) and <14-32 (0.01 ppm)(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In 1989, levels of 2-chloroaniline at 3 stations (5 samples) of the main stream Rhine delta ranged from 0.011 to 0.045 ug/L; no 2-chloroaniline was detected at 2 stations on branches of the Rhine(2). 2-Chloroaniline was detected in 83% of all samples collected at a single site on the Rhine River in 1979 at mean, median, and maximum concentrations of 0.54, 0.20, and 3.9 ppb, respectively(3). Mean, median, and maximum concentrations of 0.45, 0.21-0.42, and 1.3-1.7 ppb, respectively, were found in two tributaries of the Rhine River in 1979(3). Mean, median, and maximum concentrations of 0.06-0.15, 0.02, and 0.23-0.86 ppb, respectively, were found at two locations on the Meuse River in 1979(3). Concentrations of 2-chloroaniline in the Rhine River in 1977, 1978, and 1982 have been reported to be 0.27, 0.20, and 0.1 ppb, respectively(4). Qualitative detection was made from water taken from the Waal River in the Netherlands in October, 1974(5).",

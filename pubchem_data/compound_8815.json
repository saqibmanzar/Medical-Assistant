When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Normally /SRP: of no significant consequence/, T. gondii infections can cause devastating disease in immunosuppressed patients and through congenital infection of newborn babies. Few prophylactic and therapeutic drugs are available to treat these infections. The goal of the present study was to assess the anti-Toxoplasma effects in a congenital and noncongenital model of toxoplasmosis (using ME49 strain), besides assessing immunological changes, in vitro cytotoxicity, and in vivo acute toxicity of commercial estragole and thymol. The congenital experimental model was used with intermediate stages of maternal infection. The serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgG, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were quantified from infected and treated C57Bl/6 mice. Estragole and thymol respectively exhibited low to moderate in vivo toxicity and cytotoxicity. Animals treated with estragole showed high IFN-gamma and strong type 1 helper T cell response. Both compounds were active against T. gondii ME49 strain. Furthermore, orally administered estragole in infected pregnant mice improved the weight of offspring compared with untreated controls. Subcutaneous administration of both compounds also increased the weight of mouse offspring born to infected mothers, compared with untreated controls. Estragole and thymol display important anti-Toxoplasma activity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of action of these compounds.",

The present study was carried out to investigate the chemical composition and systemic anti-inflammatory activity of the Ocimum basilicum essential oil (EOOB) and its major component estragole, as well as its possible mechanisms of action. The Ocimum basilicum essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS. The anti-inflammatory action was verified using acute and chronic in vivo tests as paw edema, peritonitis, and vascular permeability and granulomatous inflammation model. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of action was analyzed by the participation of histamine and arachidonic acid pathways. The chemical profile analysis identified fourteen components present in the essential oil, within them: estragole (60.96%). The in vivo test results show that treatment with EOOB (100 and 50 mg/kg) and estragole (60 and 30 mg/kg) significantly reduced paw edema induced by carrageenan and dextran. The smallest doses of EOOB (50 mg/kg) and estragole (30 mg/kg) showed efficacy in the reduction of paw edema induced by histamine and arachidonic acid, vascular permeability inhibition and leukocyte emigration in the peritoneal fluid. These doses were capable of reducing the chronic inflammatory process. The results observed between the EOOB and estragole demonstrate efficacy in anti-inflammatory activity, however, the essential oil is more efficacious in the acute and chronic anti-inflammatory action. This study confirms the therapeutic potential of this plant and reinforces the validity of its use in popular medicine.",

Formation of 1'-hydroxyestragole is predominantly catalyzed by P450 1A2, 2A6, and 2E1, and results of the present study support that oxidation of 1'-hydroxyestragole is catalyzed by 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (17beta-HSD2). In a first approach, the study defines physiologically based biokinetic (PBBK) models for 14 individual human subjects, revealing a 1.8-fold interindividual variation in the area under the liver concentration-time curve (AUC) for 1'-hydroxyestragole within this group of human subjects. Variation in oxidation of 1'-hydroxyestragole by 17beta-HSD2 was shown to result in larger effects than those caused by variation in P450 enzyme activity. In a second approach, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to evaluate the extent of variation in liver levels of 1'-hydroxyestragole that could occur in the population as a whole. This analysis could be used to derive a chemical-specific adjustment factor (CSAF), which is defined as the 99th percentile divided by the 50th percentile of the predicted distribution of the AUC of 1'-hydroxyestragole in the liver. The CSAF was estimated to range between 1.6 and 4.0, depending on the level of variation that was taken into account for oxidation of 1'-hydroxyestragole. Comparison of the CSAF to the default uncertainty factor of 3.16 for human variability in biokinetics reveals that the default uncertainty factor adequately protects 99% of the population.",

The present study investigated the kinetics of the metabolic reactions of both estragole and its proximate carcinogenic metabolite 1'-hydroxyestragole in humans in incubations with relevant tissue fractions. Based on the kinetic data obtained a physiologically based biokinetic (PBBK) model for estragole in human was defined to predict the relative extent of bioactivation and detoxification at different dose levels of estragole. The outcomes of the model were subsequently compared with those previously predicted by a PBBK model for estragole in male rat to evaluate the occurrence of species differences in metabolic activation. The results obtained reveal that formation of 1'-oxoestragole, which represents a minor metabolic route for 1'-hydroxyestragole in rat, is the main detoxification pathway of 1'-hydroxyestragole in humans. Due to a high level of this 1'-hydroxyestragole oxidation pathway in human liver, the predicted species differences in formation of 1'-sulfooxyestragole remain relatively low, with the predicted formation of 1'-sulfooxyestragole being two-fold higher in human compared with male rat, even though the formation of its precursor 1'-hydroxyestragole was predicted to be fourfold higher in human. Overall, it is concluded that in spite of significant differences in the relative extent of different metabolic pathways between human and male rat there is a minor influence of species differences on the ultimate overall bioactivation of estragole to 1'-sulfooxyestragole.",

The metabolic fates of the naturally occurring food flavors trans-anethole and estragole, and their synthetic congener p-propylanisole, have been investigated in human volunteers using the [methoxy-(14)C]-labelled compounds. The doses used were close to those encountered in the diet, 1 mg, 100 micrograms and 100 micrograms respectively. 2. In each case, the major routes of elimination of (14)C were in the urine and in the expired air as (14)CO2. 3. Urinary metabolites were separated by solvent extraction, t.l.c. and h.p.l.c., and characterized by comparison of chromatographic mobilities with standards and by radioisotope dilution. Nine (14)C urinary metabolites were found after trans-anethole administration, four after p-propylanisole and five after estragole. All were products of side chain oxidations. 4. The principal metabolites of p-propylanisole were 4-methoxyhippuric acid (12%) and 1-(4'-methoxyphenyl)propan-1-ol (2%) and -2-ol (8%). 5. The major metabolite of trans-anethole was 4-methoxyhippuric acid (56% of dose), accompanied by much smaller amounts of the two isomers of 1-(4'-methoxyphenyl)propane-1,2-diol (together 3%). 6. After estragole administration, the two volunteers eliminated 0.2 and 0.4% of the dose respectively as 1'-hydroxyestragole. 7. The human metabolic data is discussed with reference to the comparative metabolic disposition of these compounds in the mouse and rat, species commonly used in their safety assessment.",

Stable isotope dilution assays based on LC-MS/MS detection revealed that 1'-hydroxylation of estragole happened very fast as the concentration of conjugated 1'-hydroxyestragole in urine peaked after 1.5 hr, whereas it was no longer detectable after 10 hr. Besides the formation of less than 0.41% conjugated 1'-hydroxyestragole of the estragole dose administered, the further metabolite p-allylphenol was generated from estragole in a higher percentage (17%). Both metabolites were also detected in blood plasma in less than 0.75-2.5 hr after consumption of fennel tea. In contrast to this, no estragole was present in these samples above its detection limit. From the results, it can be concluded that an excess of the major fennel odorant trans-anethole principally does not interfere with estragole metabolism, whereas influences on the quantitative composition of metabolites cannot be excluded. The presence of a sulfuric acid conjugate of estragole could not be confirmed, possibly due to its high reactivity and lability.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Its inactivation is correlated with tumor malignancy, possibly due to the effects on cell differentiation and malignant cell transformation. Therefore, it has been noted that PP2A could be a promising target for cancer therapy. In our previous study of the hepatocarcinogen estragole (ES), cell proliferation may be required to convert ES-specific DNA adducts to mutations. To explore the trigger for cell proliferation, gpt delta rats were administered ES by gavage at doses of 3, 30 and 300 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. ES-induced cell proliferation and gene mutations were observed at only the high dose whereas ES-specific DNA adducts were detected in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analyses revealed activation of the Akt and ERK pathways without activation of upstream regulators, such as c-Raf, PKC and, PI3K. Phosphorylation of the PP2A C subunit at Tyr307 was found along with phosphorylation of Src. The overall data might imply that PP2A inactivation is responsible for cell cycle progression through activation of the Akt and ERK pathways at high doses of ES. Based on gamma-H2AX immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis for Rad51 protein, the resultant mutation spectra showed large deletion mutations that might result from double strand breaks of DNA. Thus, it is likely that inactivation of PP2A resulted in acceleration and exacerbation of gene mutations. We conclude that PP2A might contribute to an early stage of chemical carcinogenesis, suggesting that PP2A could be a molecular target of primary cancer prevention.",

The importance of choosing these plant extracts as samples is emanating from the dual roles of their bioactive compounds (trans-anethole and estragole), which can alter positively or negatively different cellular processes, and necessity to a simple and efficient method for extraction and sensitive determination of these compounds in the mentioned samples. Under the optimum conditions (including extraction solvent: 120 uL of n-octanol; dispersive solvent: 600 uL of acetone; collecting solvent: 1000 uL of acetone, sample pH 3; with no salt), limits of detection (LODs), linear dynamic ranges (LDRs) and recoveries (R) were 79-81 ng/mL, 0.26-6.9 ug/mL and 94.1-99.9%, respectively. The obtained results showed that the IS-R-DLLME was a simple, fast and sensitive method with low level consumption of extraction solvent which provides high recovery under the optimum conditions. The present method was applied to investigate the absorption amounts of the mentioned analytes through the determination of the analytes before (in the plant extracts) and after (in the human plasma and urine samples) the consumption which can determine the toxicity levels of the analytes (on the basis of their dosages) in the extracts.",

The importance of choosing these plant extracts as samples is emanating from the dual roles of their bioactive compounds (trans-anethole and estragole), which can alter positively or negatively different cellular processes, and necessity to a simple and efficient method for extraction and sensitive determination of these compounds in the mentioned samples. Under the optimum conditions (including extraction solvent: 120 uL of n-octanol; dispersive solvent: 600 uL of acetone; collecting solvent: 1000 uL of acetone, sample pH 3; with no salt), limits of detection (LODs), linear dynamic ranges (LDRs) and recoveries (R) were 79-81 ng/mL, 0.26-6.9 ug/mL and 94.1-99.9%, respectively. The obtained results showed that the IS-R-DLLME was a simple, fast and sensitive method with low level consumption of extraction solvent which provides high recovery under the optimum conditions. The present method was applied to investigate the absorption amounts of the mentioned analytes through the determination of the analytes before (in the plant extracts) and after (in the human plasma and urine samples) the consumption which can determine the toxicity levels of the analytes (on the basis of their dosages) in the extracts.",

It is used in perfumes and as flavor in foods and liqueurs. It has been tested as an experimental therapy. HUMAN STUDIES: When tested as 3% in petrolatum, it produced no irritation after a 48-hr closed-patch test on human subjects. A maximization test was carried out on 25 volunteers. The material was tested at a concentration of 3% in petrolatum and produced no sensitization reactions. It was not mutagenic when tested on human cells in vitro. ANIMAL STUDIES: Rats given 4 daily oral doses of 605 mg/kg estragole showed minor liver damage, consisting of discoloration, mottling and blunting of lobe edge. Applied full strength to intact or abraded rabbit skin for 24 hr under occlusion estragole was moderately irritating. Estragole is a rodent liver carcinogen which requires bioactivation. It induced hepatocellular carcinomas by 15 months in 23 and 39% of the mice that received total doses of 4.4 and 5.2 umoles, respectively. In rats estragole induced dose-dependent increases in DNA damage following EndoIII or hOGG1 digestion and without enzyme treatment in liver, the cancer target organ. The formation of estragole-specific DNA adducts following conversion from estragole to the nucleophilic metabolite by sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) has been reported.",

METHODS: The anti-edematogenic effects of anethole and estragole were evaluated through plethysmometry in Swiss mice. RESULTS: Anethole inhibited carrageenan-induced edema at doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg from 60 to 240 min after induction. However, the inhibitory effects of estragole were observed only from 60 to 120 min at the two highest doses. Anethole and estragole similarly inhibited edema elicited by substance P, bradykinin, histamine and TNF-alpha but were different in the inhibition of serotonin-elicited edema. In addition, only estragole inhibited sodium nitroprusside-induced edema. CONCLUSIONS: Anethole and estragole showed different profiles in the anti-inflammatory response to substance P, bradykinin, histamine, serotonin and TNF-alpha NO is involved only in the inhibition mechanism of estragole.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Estragole and nevadensin were co-administered orally to Sprague-Dawley rats, at a ratio reflecting their presence in basil. Moreover, previously developed physiologically based biokinetic (PBBK) models to study this inhibition in rat and in human liver were refined by including a submodel describing nevadensin kinetics. Nevadensin resulted in a significant 36% reduction in the levels of estragole DNA adducts formed in the liver of rats. The refined PBBK model predicts the formation of estragole DNA adducts in the liver of rat with less than twofold difference compared to in vivo data and suggests more potent inhibition in the liver of human compared to rat due to less efficient metabolism of nevadensin in human liver and intestine. CONCLUSION: Given the role of the SULT-mediated DNA adduct formation in the hepatocarcinogenicity of estragole, the results of the present study suggest that the likelihood of bioactivation and subsequent adverse effects in rodent bioassays may be lower when estragole is dosed with nevadensin compared to dosing of pure estragole.",

In rodent bioassays, estragole induces hepatomas, an effect ascribed to estragole bioactivation to 1'-sulfooxyestragole resulting in DNA adduct formation. The present paper identifies nevadensin as a basil constituent able to inhibit DNA adduct formation in rat hepatocytes exposed to the proximate carcinogen 1'-hydroxyestragole and nevadensin. This inhibition occurs at the level of sulfotransferase (SULT)-mediated bioactivation of 1'-hydroxyestragole. The Ki for SULT inhibition by nevadensin was 4 nM in male rat and human liver fractions. Furthermore, nevadensin up to 20 uM did not inhibit 1'-hydroxyestragole detoxification by glucuronidation and oxidation. The inhibition of SULT by nevadensin was incorporated into the recently developed physiologically based biokinetic (PBBK) rat and human models for estragole bioactivation and detoxification. The results predict that co-administration of estragole at a level inducing hepatic tumors in vivo (50 mg/kg bw) with nevadensin at a molar ratio of 0.06, representing the ratio of their occurrence in basil, results in almost 100% inhibition of the ultimate carcinogen 1'-sulfooxyestragole when assuming 100% uptake of nevadensin. Assuming 1% uptake, inhibition would still amount to more than 83%. Altogether these data point at a nevadensin-mediated inhibition of the formation of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of estragole, without reducing the capacity to detoxify 1'-hydroxyestragole via glucuronidation or oxidation. These data also point at a potential reduction of the cancer risk when estragole exposure occurs within a food matrix containing SULT inhibitors compared to what is observed upon exposure to pure estragole.",

Toward this end, an MTT cytotoxicity assay, a trypan blue dye exclusion test, a double-staining (acridine orange and DAPI) fluorescence viability assay, a single-cell microgel-electrophoresis (comet) assay, a mitochondrial membrane potential (delta-psi-m) assay, and a DNA fragmentation analysis were conducted.

In the European contest, one of the major sources of human exposure to this phytochemical is Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (fennel). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro toxicity of estragole in the context of two complex phytochemical mixtures derived from fennel: fennel seed powder (FSPw) and fennel seed essential oil (FSEO). The estragole-containing preparations were analyzed for their ability to cause cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, apoptosis and cell cycle perturbation in the human hepatoma (HepG2) cell line. None of the tested concentrations of FSPw induced DNA damage, nor apoptosis or cell cycle perturbation. Although FSEO did not induce any genetic damage as well, it exerted marked dose-dependent apoptotic effects on HepG2 cells with a concurrent cell cycle arrest in G2/M at the highest tested dose. Although prospective analyses are required to clarify the observed toxic effects of FSEO, our results support the hypothesis that the genotoxicity of estragole may be significantly reduced or null in the context of botanical mixtures.",

The aim of the present study was to model possible levels of DNA adduct formation in (individual) humans upon exposure to estragole. This was done by extending a previously defined PBK model for estragole in humans to include (i) new data on interindividual variation in the kinetics for the major PBK model parameters influencing the formation of 1'-sulfooxyestragole, (ii) an equation describing the relationship between 1'-sulfooxyestragole and DNA adduct formation, (iii) Monte Carlo modeling to simulate interindividual human variation in DNA adduct formation in the population, and (iv) a comparison of the predictions made to human data on DNA adduct formation for the related alkenylbenzene methyleugenol. Adequate model predictions could be made, with the predicted DNA adduct levels at the estimated daily intake of estragole of 0.01 mg/kg bw ranging between 1.6 and 8.8 adducts in 10(8) nucleotides (nts) (50th and 99th percentiles, respectively). This is somewhat lower than values reported in the literature for the related alkenylbenzene methyleugenol in surgical human liver samples. The predicted levels seem to be below DNA adduct levels that are linked with tumor formation by alkenylbenzenes in rodents, which were estimated to amount to 188-500 adducts per 10(8) nts at the BMD10 values of estragole and methyleugenol. Although this does not seem to point to a significant health concern for human dietary exposure, drawing firm conclusions may have to await further validation of the model's predictions.",

Male Fischer 344 rats were given estragole orally and hepatic protein adducts were detected by immunoblotting, using antisera raised by immunizing rabbits with 4-methoxycinnamic acid-modified rabbit serum albumin. A major 155-kDa adduct was expressed in livers of animals that had been treated with estragole at 100, 300, or 500 mg/kg. Levels of expression of the adduct increased disproportionately with respect to dose, and other adducts (170, 100, 44, and 35 kDa) were detected also in the high-dose group. Rats given estragole for 5 days, at 300 mg/kg/day, expressed predominantly 155- and 44-kDa adducts. The 155-, 100-, 44-, and 35-kDa adducts were detected in greatest abundance in liver microsomal fractions, while the 170-kDa adduct was most abundant in the nuclear fraction. Interestingly, whereas the 170-, 155-, 100-, and 35-kDa adducts were detected in cytosolic fractions, relatively low levels of the 44-kDa adduct were detected in nuclear fractions but not in cytosolic fractions. The various adducts were solubilized when microsomal fractions were extracted with sodium carbonate and were digested by trypsin. This implies that the target proteins are peripheral membrane proteins bound to the outer surface of microsomal membranes. Experiments undertaken with isolated rat hepatocytes and with V79 cells transfected with human monoamine phenol sulfotransferase cDNA revealed that adduct formation required 1'-hydroxylation of estragole, followed by sulfation. The pattern of adducts expressed when the transfected V79 cells were incubated with 1'-hydroxyestragole was very similar to that expressed in livers of estragole-treated rats. These cells should constitute a valuable in vitro model system for investigation of toxicological consequences arising from estragole-induced protein adduct formation.",

Castration only slightly decreases the resistance of males to hepatotoxic action of estragole but significantly increases it in females; exogenous administration of estradiole benzoate to castrated males decreases their resistance to the hepatotoxin, whereas administration of testosterone propionate to ovariectomyzed females does not elevate it. Morphologically, estragole damages the same number of liver cells in females and males, but in males it induces mostly hydropic degenerative, and in females--necrotic changes of hepatocytes.",

Mean body weights of the 300 and 600 mg/kg groups were 73% to 92%, respectively, of those of the vehicle control groups. A staining pattern on the ventral surface anterior to the genitalia beginning at week 9 in the 300 and 600 mg/kg groups was attributed to residue of estragole or metabolites in the urine. Alterations in the erythron related to estragole administration occurred in male and female rats; male rats demonstrated a stronger response. The changes in the erythron were characterized as a microcytic, normochromic, nonresponsive anemia. There were decreases in serum iron concentration in the 300 mg/kg females and 600 mg/kg males and females. The average percent saturation of total iron binding capacity was decreased in the 600 mg/kg males and females. Dose-related increases in platelet counts occurred in most of the dosed groups of rats; the effect appeared to be stronger in males. The increase could be consistent with a reactive thrombocytosis. Increases in the serum alanine aminotransferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities suggested a hepatocellular effect (increased leakage) and were consistent with the morphological liver changes observed. There were dose-related increases in serum bile salt concentration in most treated male rats at all time points; females were less affected. Absolute and relative liver weights were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg males and in 75 mg/kg or greater females. Relative kidney weights were significantly increased in all dosed groups of male rats and in female rats given 75 mg/kg or greater. Absolute and relative testis weights of 300 and 600 mg/kg males were significantly decreased. Two 600 mg/kg male rats had multiple cholangiocarcinomas in the liver and a third had an hepatocellular adenoma. All 600 mg/kg males exhibited cholangiofibrosis. All 75 mg/kg or greater males and all 150 mg/kg or greater females had hepatocellular hypertrophy. Incidences of bile duct hyperplasia, oval cell hyperplasia, and chronic periportal inflammation were significantly increased in all dosed groups. Incidences of basophilic and mixed cell foci were significantly increased in 150 mg/kg or greater males and females. Incidences of eosinophilic focus were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg males and 600 mg/kg females. Incidences of cellular infiltration of the periportal region by histiocytes increased significantly in all dosed groups of males and in 150 mg/kg or greater females. Incidences of bone marrow hyperplasia were significantly increased in 75, 300, and 600 mg/kg male rats. Incidences of renal tubule papillary mineralization were significantly increased in 300 mg/kg males and females and 600 mg/kg males. Incidences of cortical renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in 150 mg/kg or greater males, and the incidence of renal tubule regeneration was significantly increased in 600 mg/kg females. Incidences of degeneration of the olfactory epithelium in the nose were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg rats. Incidences of hypertrophied chromophobe cells in the pars distalis of the pituitary gland were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg males. Cytoplasmic alteration of the submandibular salivary gland occurred in all 75 mg/kg or greater rats. Incidences of atrophy of the gastric glands in the stomach were significantly increased in 150 mg/kg or greater rats. Bilateral degeneration of the germinal epithelium in the testes and bilateral hypospermia of the epididymis occurred in all 300 and 600 mg/kg males.",

Mean body weights of 300 and 600 mg/kg males and 75 mg/kg or greater females were 79% to 89% those of the vehicle control groups.  Liver weights were generally increased in 75 mg/kg or greater males and in 300 mg/kg females. Relative thymus weights were significantly increased in all dosed groups of female mice.  The incidences of hepatocellular hypertrophy and hepatocellular degeneration were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg male mice and 150 and 300 mg/kg female mice. Incidences of oval cell hyperplasia were significantly increased in 300 and 600 mg/kg males and in 75 mg/kg or greater females. Liver necrosis occurred in all 600 mg/kg female mice, along with a significant increase in the incidence of diffuse fatty change. In addition, 600 mg/kg females exhibited significant increases in the incidences of degeneration of the gastric glands of the glandular stomach, as well as squamous hyperplasia, mineralization, and ulcer in the forestomach. Degeneration of the olfactory epithelium in the nose occurred in all 300 and 600 mg/kg mice.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.17 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)benzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)benzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 hrs. 1-Methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)benzene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)benzene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 520. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.6X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)benzene has an estimated vapor pressure of 0.17 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)benzene may volatilize from dry soil. Utilizing the OECD 301F ready Biodegradability test, 48% O2 consumption was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)benzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hrs and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 90 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)benzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)benzene is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)benzene via ingestion of food and some beverages, inhalation of ambient air in forested areas and dermal contact with and inhalation of consumer products containing 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)benzene.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

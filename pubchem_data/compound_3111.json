It has a role as an antipyretic, an antirheumatic drug, a non-narcotic analgesic, a peripheral nervous system drug, a prodrug, a cyclooxygenase 3 inhibitor and an anti-inflammatory agent.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

In addition to anti-inflammatory actions, they have analgesic, antipyretic, and platelet-inhibitory actions.

Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis accounts for their analgesic, antipyretic, and platelet-inhibitory actions; other mechanisms may contribute to their anti-inflammatory effects.

The N-demethylation of MAA is mainly mediated by CYP3A4, although CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 may also be involved. FAA is an end metabolite, while AA is acetylated by N-acetyl-transferase to form 4-acetyl-amino-antipyrine (AAA). The unchanged drug may be present in plasma following the intravenous administration of metamizole; however, following oral administration, it cannot be detected in plasma or urine.",

Its active metabolites, 4-methyl-amino-antipyrine (MAA) and 4-amino-antipyrine (AA), inhibit prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>)-induced hyperalgesia. It has been suggested that the anti-hyperalgesic effect of MAA is mediated by guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) activation and ATP-sensitive potassium channel opening, while the effects of AA are associated with the activation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). Metamizole is classified in some sources as a weak non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); however, evidence suggests that its analgesic effects do not depend on its anti-inflammatory properties. Although the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 may play a role in the central nervous system effects of metamizole, reports suggest that metamizole inhibits COX-3 with a higher affinity compared to COX-1 or COX-2.",

The enzyme elevations are typically hepatocellular, but mixed and even cholestatic patterns have been described. The disease is usually self-limited with rapid improvement once metamizole is stopped. Rash, fever, and eosinophilia arise in some cases but are generally transient and mild. Autoantibodies including ANA and AMA are frequently detected, but IgG levels are usually normal and liver histology does not resemble autoimmune hepatitis. Recovery is usually rapid once metamizole is stopped and rarely requires immunosuppressive therapy. As might be expected, the fatality rate appears to be at least 10% in cases with hepatocellular injury and jaundice. There have been reports of fatalities and need for liver transplants due to liver injury caused by the drug. Recurrence upon re-exposure is usually abrupt in onset and more severe in course than the initial episode.",

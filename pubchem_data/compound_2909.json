PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

In rheumatoid arthritis, cyclosporine is used in cases of severe disease that have not responded to methotrexate. Cyclosporine can be used in combination with methotrexate, but the levels of both drugs must be monitored closely. In psoriasis, cyclosporine is indicated for treatment of adult nonimmunocompromised patients with severe & disabling disease who have failed other systemic therapies. Because of its mechanism of action, there is a theoretical bases for the use of cyclosporine in a variety of other T-cell-mediated diseases.

The extent of absorption depends upon several variables, including the individual patient & formulation used. The elimination of cyclosporine form the blood is generally biphasic, with a terminal half-life of 5-18 hr. After iv infusion, clearance is approx 5-7 ml/min/kg in adult recipients of renal transplants, but results differ by age & patient populations. For example, clearance is slower in cardiac transplant patients & more rapid in children. The relationship between admin dose & the area under the plasma concn-vs-time curve is linear within the therapeutic range, but the intersubject variability is so large that individual monitoring is required.",

It appears safe to maintain a trough plasma cyclosporine concn of about 75-150 ng/ml; however, this does not necessarily guarantee safety from nephrotoxicity. Because of preferential distribution of cyclosporine & its metabolites into red blood cells, blood levels are generally higher than plasma levels. When blood cyclosporine levels are 300-600 ng/ml by radioimmunoassay, cerebrospinal fluid levels range from 10-50 ng/ml.

It preferentially inhibits antigen-triggered signal transduction in T lymphocytes, blunting expression of many lymphokines, including /(interleukin-2)/ IL-2, as well as expression of antiapoptotic proteins. Cyclosporine forms a complex with cyclophilin, a cytoplasmic receptor protein present in target cells. This complex binds to calcineurin, inhibiting Ca2+ stimulated dephosphorylation of the cytosolic component of NFAT. When the cytoplasmic component of NFAT is dephosphorylated, it translocates to the nucleus, where it complexes with nuclear components required for complete T-cell activation, including transactivation of IL-2 & other lymphokine genes. Calcineurin enzymatic activity is inhibited following physical interaction with the cyclosporine/cyclophilin complex. This results in the blockade of NFAT dephosphorylation; thus, the cytoplasmic component of NFAT does not enter the nucleus, gene transcription is not activated, & the T lymphocyte fails to respond to specific antigenic stimulation Cyclosporine also increases expression of transforming growth fact /beta/ (TGF-B), a potent inhibitor of IL-2-stimulated T-cell proliferation & generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).",

This effect is not due to an inhibition of calcineurin, which mediates the immunosuppressive effect of CsA, because other calcineurin inhibitors, deltamethrin & tacrolimus, did not affect the oscillations in [Ca(2+)](c) of the B-cells. The CsA-induced decr in [Ca(2+)](c) to basal values was not caused by a direct inhibition of L-type Ca(2+) channels. CsA is known to be a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), which ... /the authors/ recently suggested to be involved in the regulation of oscillations. Consequently, CsA also inhibited the oscillations of the cell membrane potential, & it is shown that these effects could not be ascribed to cellular ATP depletion. However, the mitochondrial membrane potential Delta Psi was affected by CsA by inhibiting the oscillations in Delta Psi. ... The observed reduction in [Ca(2+)](c) could be counteracted by the K(+)(ATP) channel blocker tolbutamide, indicating that the stimulus-secretion coupling was interrupted before the closure of K(+)(ATP) channels. It is concluded that CsA alters B-cell function by inhibiting the mitochondrial PTP. This terminates the oscillatory activity that is indispensable for adequate insulin secretion. Thus, CsA acts on different targets to induce the immunosuppressive & the diabetogenic effect.",

Any drug that affects microsomal enzymes, especially the CYP3A system, may affect cyclosporine blood concns. Substances that inhibit this enzyme can decr cyclosporine metab & incr blood concns. These include calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, nicardipine), antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole, ketoconazole), antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), glucocorticoids (e.g., methylprednisolone), HIV-protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir), & other drugs (e.g., allupurinol & metoclopramide). In addition, grapefruit & grapefruit juice block the CYP3A system & incr cyclosporine blood concns & thus should be avoided by patients receiving the drug. In contrast, drugs that induce CYP3A activity can incr cyclosporine metab & decr blood concns. Drugs that can decr cyclosporine concns in this manner include antibiotics (e.g., nafcillin & refampin), anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin), & other drugs (e.g., octreotide, ticlopidine). In general, close monitoring of cyclosporine blood levels & the levels of other drugs is required when such combinations are used. Interactions between cyclosporine & sirolimus have led to the recommendation that admin of the two drugs be separated by time. Sirolimus aggravate cyclosporine-induced renal dysfunction, while cyclosporine increases sirolimus-induced hyperlipemia & myelosuppression. Other cyclosporine-drug interactions of concern include additive nephrotoxicity when coadministered with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs & other drugs that cause renal dysfunction; elevation in methotrexate levels when the two drugs are coadministered; & reduced clearance of other drugs, including prednisolone, digoxin, & lovastatin.",

Since cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced overgrowth seldom occurs at sites distant from teeth, the periodontal ligament has been considered significant. The aim of this study was to examine overgrowth occurrence at the edentulous ridge--the sites without the ligament--after CsA therapy in rats. ... After extracting all right maxillary molars, 16 Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 2-wk healing period. The animals were separated into CsA & control groups. CsA rats received 15 mg/kg of CsA by gastric feeding for 4 wk, while the control group received only mineral oil. At the end of study, all animals were sacrificed & stone models were immediately obtained by rubber-based impressions. The edentulous ridge morphology, including the bucco-lingual width & the vertical height, was measured on the models. For histometry, 10 sections were selected from the edentulous ridge of each animal after undecalcified tissue preparation. The soft tissue areas of the edentulous ridge & the trabecular bone morphology of the dental alveolus were measured. ... CsA therapy produced a significant incr of the ridge width & height, measured from the stone models, when compared to the control group. Under histometry, CsA resulted in a significant incr of the epithelium, connective tissue, & total soft tissue areas. The measured trabecular bone volume was affected by both examining factors: the drug therapy & the location of the dental alveolus. CsA therapy produced a significant loss of bone volume but a significant incr of the bone-specific surface area. Although the mean osteoid volume was similar between CsA & control groups, a significant decr of the fractional formation surface in the CsA group was revealed. ... An enlarged edentulous ridge & an altered dental alveolar bone morphology were observed in CsA-treated animals at the end of the study; therefore, we suggest that CsA may induce not only a soft tissue overgrowth but also an alveolar bone alteration at the edentulous ridge. The hypothesis that tooth or periodontal ligament is an essential component for the overgrowth development is questioned.",

Rats were given 1 mg/kg of CsA or 0.4 mg/kg of SRL alone or in combination via constant iv infusion. Renal function was evaluated at the end of treatment. Blood samples were obtained to estimate CsA & SRL concns. Hepatic microsomes were prepared for immunoblotting and catalytic assays. ... CsA alone did not alter serum creatinine levels. SRL given alone or in combination with CsA produced a significant incr in urine output without changes in fluid balance. Although CsA & SRL administered alone caused damage to renal proximal tubules, the two-drug combination dramatically increased the renal structural damage. CsA alone suppressed cytochrome p450 (CYP) 3A2 protein levels by 39% (P=0.012) & catalytic activity by 30% (P=0.042). SRL alone reduced catalytic activity by 38% (P=0.012). Combination therapy reduced both CYP3A2 levels by 55% (P<0.001) & catalytic activity by 55% (P=0.001). CYP2C11 protein expression or catalytic activity were not changed in any group. CYP2A1 protein expression & catalytic activity were both significantly reduced in rats given CsA or/& SRL. Steady-state CsA levels were increased during concurrent SRL dosing, however, SRL concentrations were not changed by CsA coadmin. ... /It was concluded that/ concurrent SRL dosing increases CsA concns due to inhibition of hepatic CYP3A2 protein expression. Nephrotoxicity caused by combination therapy is due to CsA elevating levels of SRL or by SRL itself. Concurrent admin of CsA & SRL in transplant patients should be performed with caution.",

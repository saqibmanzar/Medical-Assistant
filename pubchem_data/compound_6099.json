PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The concentration of methylene blue in whole blood was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography in seven volunteers after IV and oral administration of 100 mg methylene blue with and without mesna. The distribution of methylene blue in different tissues was measured in rats after intraduodenal and IV application. The time course of methylene blue in whole blood after IV administration showed a multiphasic time course with an estimated terminal half-life of 5.25 hr. Following oral administration, the area under the concentration-time curve was much lower (9 nmol/min/mL vs 137 nmol/min/mL). Co-administration of mesna, which could influence distribution by ion-pairing, did not alter the pharmacokinetics. The urinary excretion of methylene blue and its leukoform was only moderately higher after IV administration (18% vs 28% dose). Intraduodenal administration to rats resulted in higher concentrations in intestinal wall and liver but lower concentrations in whole blood and brain than IV methylene blue. Differences in organ distribution of methylene blue are mainly responsible for the different pharmacokinetics after oral and IV administration. ...",

METHODS: To investigate the safety of blue dye for lymphatic mapping in pregnant women, the pharmacokinetics of methylene blue dye were examined in 10 nonpregnant women, and the results were extrapolated to estimate maximal fetal exposure to the dye. RESULTS: Plasma and urine measurements indicated that the dye quickly distributed from the breast injection site to the circulation, with 32% of the total dose excreted in urine within 48 hours. Combined with existing data on organ distribution of methylene blue, the estimated maximal dose to the fetus is 0.25 mg (5% of the administered dose), likely further reduced by other physiologic factors related to pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis suggests that methylene blue dye can be used for lymphatic mapping in pregnancy-associated breast cancer with minimal fetal risk.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

One preclinical treatment study in tauopathy mice reported anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective effects mediated by the Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE); another reported insoluble tau reduction and a learning and memory benefit when given early.  * In Methemoglobinemia: Methylene Blue acts by reacting within RBC to form leukomethylene blue, which is a reducing agent of oxidized hemoglobin converting the ferric ion (fe+++) back to its oxygen-carrying ferrous state(fe++).  * As antimalarial agent: Methylene Blue, a specific inhibitor of P.falciparum glutathione reductase has the potential to reverse CQ resistance and it prevents the polymerization of haem into haemozoin similar to 4-amino-quinoline antimalarials.  * For ifosfamide induced neurotoxicity: Methylene blue functions as an alternate electron acceptor. It acts to reverse the NADH inhibition caused by gluconeogenesis in the liver while blocking the transformation of chloroethylamine into chloroacetaldehyde. In addition, it inhibits various amine oxidase activities, which also prevents the formation of chloroacetaldehyde.",

Control or methylene blue pretreated rabbit pulmonary arterial smooth muscle were stimulated with sodium nitroprusside, nitrosothiols or endothelium derived relaxing factor released basally from bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, in short term cocultures. The putative endothelium-derived relaxing factor, S-nitroso-L-cysteine, a stab1e deaminated analog of S-nitroso-L-cysteine, S-nitroso-3-mercaptoproprionic acid and sodium nitroprusside produced concentration-dependent (1-100 uM) increase (1.5- to 12-fold) in rabbit pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells cyclic guanosine monophospate levels. Methylene blue pretreatment inhibited S-nitroso-L-cysteine and sodium nitroprusside induced cyclic guanosine monophosphate accumulation by 51% to 100%, but S-nitroso-3-mercaptoproprionic acid mediated responses were not altered by methylene blue. The inhibition profile of methylene blue on nitrovasodilator induced cyclic guanosine monophosphate accumulation was quantitatively reproduced by extracellular generation of superoxide anion with xanthine (100 uM) and xanthine oxidase (5 mU). Similarly to methylene blue pretreatment, superoxide anion generation had no effects on base-line cyclic guanosine phosphate levels or cyclic guanosine phosphate responses elicited by S-nitroso-3-mercaptoproprionic acid. Furthermore, methylene blue induced a dose and time dependent generation of superoxide anion from rabbit pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, as evidenced from spectrophotometric determination of cytochrome c reduction. Inhibition of cyclic guanosine monophosphate accumulation in response to S-nitroso-L-cysteine and sodium nitroprusside by methylene blue was completely prevented by superoxide dismutase but not catalase. Selective pretreatment of endothelial cells with methylene blue before co-culture with untreated rabbit pulmonary arterial smooth muscle produced a reduction in rabbit pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels of a magnitude comparable with that seen in cocultures of methylene blue pretreated rabbit pulmonary arterial smooth muscle with untreated endothelial cells, and which was partially prevented by superoxide dismutase.",

Methylene blue is also an antimicrobial agent in plastic materials such as food packaging wraps, surgical drapes, face masks, and other film materials. Light exposure of the dye dispersed in plastic generates reactive singlet oxygen, which is the active antimicrobial species. Methylene blue is approved for topical, intravenous, and oral administration. Its cellular adsorption selectivity, subcellular localization, reduction to leuko-dye by mitochondria, and photoreaction with DNA have been of interest for decades. Recent applications of this technology to HIV phototherapy have reviewed previous methylene blue literature .",

It is used as a stain in bacteriology, as mixed indicator, a dye, a redox colorimetric agent, and a targeting agent for melanoma. It is also used as a medication to treat drug-induced methemoglobinemia. HUMAN STUDIES: Methemoglobinemia is usually treated with methylene blue. However, in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, methylene blue can induce methemoglobinemia. Preclinical studies have shown that low-dose methylene blue increases mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase activity in the brain and improves memory retention after learning tasks, including fear extinction. The intracameral use of 1% methylene blue has a cytotoxic effect on the corneal endothelium and iris epithelium. Several cases of suspected serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients who received methylene blue in combination with serotonin active agents. Allergic hypersensitivity reaction to methylene blue-treated plasma transfusion has also been reported. A preterm infant had methemoglobulinemia and hemolytic anemia after enteral administration of methylene blue. There is epidemiologic evidence that methylene blue is a teratogen, and the drug can cause fetal harm if administered during pregnancy. Use of methylene blue in amniocentesis has been associated with atresia of the ileum and jejunum, ileal occlusion, and other adverse effects in neonates. Use of methylene blue during pregnancy has resulted in hemolytic anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, methemoglobinemia, respiratory distress, skin staining, and phototoxicity in neonates. ANIMAL STUDIES: Methylene blue treatment resulted in methemoglobin formation and oxidative damage to red blood cells, leading to a regenerative anemia and a variety of tissue and biochemical changes secondary to erythrocyte injury. An early change was a dose-related increase in methemoglobin, where the response of rats and mice was similar in magnitude. Mice appeared to be more sensitive than rats to the formation of Heinz bodies and the development of anemia that was characterized by a decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte count. Splenomegaly was apparent in all treated mice and in the 100 mg/kg (males only) and 200 mg/kg rats at necropsy. Methylene blue was embryotoxic in the rat. Methylene blue caused the mice to deliver before gestation day 18 (term gestation). This response was observed in 45%, 50% and 83% of animals receiving methylene blue at 50, 60 or 85 mg/kg, respectively. Under cell-free conditions methylene blue induced DNA damage. It is characterized by a high number of base modifications sensitive to the repair endonuclease FPG protein (formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase). Methylene blue was mutagenic in cultured mammalian cells. In contrast, results from the mouse micronucleus assay suggest that the genotoxicity is not expressed in vivo. The greatest concerns with methylene blue therapy in veterinary use are the development of Heinz body anemia or other red cell morphological changes, methemoglobinemia, and decreased red cell life spans. Cats tent to be very sensitive to these effects and some consider it contraindicated in feline patients, but dogs and horses can also develop hematologic adverse effects at relatively low dosages. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Methylene blue had a teratogenic effect in angelfish.",

Its presentation after general anesthesia may be atypical and therefore more difficult to diagnose. However, the syndrome is completely preventable if serotonin re-uptake inhibiting agents are stopped beforehand.",

We observed that addition of NaN(3) (100 uM or 10 mM) to gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative Escherichia coli incubated with methylene blue (MB) and illuminated with red light gave significantly increased bacterial killing (1-3 logs), rather than the expected protection from killing. A different antibacterial photosensitizer, the conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) (PEI-ce6), showed reduced PDT killing (1-2 logs) after addition of 10 mM NaN(3). Azide (0.5 mM) potentiated bacterial killing by Fenton reagent (hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulfate) by up to 3 logs, but protected against killing mediated by sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide (considered to be a chemical source of singlet oxygen). The intermediacy of N(3)() was confirmed by spin-trapping and electron spin resonance studies in both MB-photosensitized reactions and Fenton reagent with addition of NaN(3). We found that N(3)() was formed and bacteria were killed even in the absence of oxygen, suggesting the direct one-electron oxidation of azide anion by photoexcited MB. This observation suggests a possible mechanism to carry out oxygen-independent PDT.",

Methylene blue at 100 mg/L was used in this study. The toxicity was also monitored by the Vibrio fischeri light inhibition test. When electrochemical oxidation was used, 99% color and 84% COD were removed from the methylene blue solution in 20 min at a current density of 428 Am(-2), NaCl of 1000 mg/L, and pH(0) of 7. However, the decolorized solution showed high toxicity (100% light inhibition). For fly ash adsorption, a high dose of fly ash (>20,000 mg/L) was needed to remove methylene blue, and the Freundlich isotherm described the adsorption behavior well. In the combined electrochemical oxidation-fly ash adsorption treatment, the addition of 4000 mg/L fly ash effectively reduced intermediate toxicity and decreased the COD of the electrochemical oxidation-treated methylene blue solution. The results indicated that the combined process effectively removed color, COD, and intermediate toxicity of the methylene blue solution.",

The authors report on the first controlled experiment to examine the memory-enhancing effects of posttraining methylene blue administration on retention of fear extinction and contextual memory following fear extinction training. METHOD: Adult participants displaying marked claustrophobic fear were randomly assigned to double-blind administration of 260 mg of methylene blue (N=23) or administration of placebo (N=19) immediately following six 5-minute extinction trials in an enclosed chamber. Retesting occurred 1 month later to assess fear renewal as indexed by peak fear during exposure to a nontraining chamber, with the prediction that the effects of methylene blue would vary as a function of fear reduction achieved during extinction training. Incidental contextual memory was assessed 1 and 30 days after training to assess the cognitive-enhancing effects of methylene blue independent of its effects on fear attenuation. RESULTS: Consistent with predictions, participants displaying low end fear posttraining showed significantly less fear at the 1-month follow-up if they received methylene blue posttraining compared with placebo. In contrast, participants displaying moderate to high levels of posttraining fear tended to fare worse at the follow-up if they received methylene blue posttraining. Methylene blue's enhancement of contextual memory was unrelated to initial or posttraining claustrophobic fear. CONCLUSIONS: Methylene blue enhances memory and the retention of fear extinction when administered after a successful exposure session but may have a deleterious effect on extinction when administered after an unsuccessful exposure session.",

All patients were preoxygenated and were anesthetized with sodium thiopental, N2O, O2, and fentanyl. Maintenance relaxation was obtained with pancuronium bromide. Arterial pressure was monitored by percutaneous arterial catheter. Following exposure of the kidney and renal pedicle, an electromagnetic flow probe was attached to the renal artery and baseline flows recorded. Following baseline measurements, 20 mL of 1 percent methylene blue was given intravenously. All patients studied showed an immediate rise in BP, and 11/12 showed a simultaneous decrease in RBF. The average fall in RBF was 35 percent at one minute. Both parameters returned to normal values on the average in 177 seconds. The decreased RBF appeared to be part of a generalized vasoconstrition caused either by sympathetic reflexes or by the direct action of methylene blue.",

Copious irrigation was performed upon realization of incorrect dye use. Corneal edema and iris discoloration developed during the early postoperative period and persisted at 24-months follow-up. However, keratoplasty was not required. The intracameral use of 1% methylene blue has a cytotoxic effect on the corneal endothelium and iris epithelium. Copious irrigation for at least 30 min using an anterior chamber maintainer may improve outcomes.",

Blood samples from 10 animals/sex/dose group were collected at the end of study weeks 1, 6, and 13. Methylene blue treatment resulted in methemoglobin formation and oxidative damage to red blood cells, leading to a regenerative anemia and a variety of tissue and biochemical changes secondary to erythrocyte injury. An early change was a dose-related increase in methemoglobin, where the response of rats and mice was similar in magnitude. Mice appeared to be more sensitive than rats to the formation of Heinz bodies and the development of anemia that was characterized by a decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte count. Splenomegaly was apparent in all treated mice and in the 100 mg/kg (males only) and 200 mg/kg rats at necropsy. There was a dose-related increase in absolute and relative spleen weight for both species. Microscopic examination revealed increased splenic hematopoiesis in all mice treatment groups and in rats at the 50 mg/kg dose level and above. Splenic congestion and bone marrow hyperplasia were also observed in these rat-dose groups. Mice at the higher doses showed hematopoiesis in the liver and accumulation of hemosiderin in Kupffer cells. These gross and microscopic findings are consistent with the development of hemolytic anemia. A dose-related increase in the reticulocyte count during study weeks 6 and 13 suggested a compensatory response to anemia.",

On the other hand, the teratogenic potential of transplacental exposure to methylene blue has not been determined. Methylene blue was administered subcutaneously to ICR (CD-1) mice at 0, 35, 50, 60, or 70 mg/kg on gestation day 8 (plug day = day 0). Teratological assessments were carried out at term gestation, on gestation day 18. Since methylene blue inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase enzyme activity, zaprinast (ZPN), a selective cGMP-phosphodiesterase type V inhibitor, was administered to prevent developmental disorders initiated by methylene blue at 50 mg/kg. There was a dose-dependent increment of embryolethality. Methylene blue treatment also produced axial skeleton and neural tube defects. Coadministration of ZPN (20 mg/kg per three times) abolished completely methylene blue-induced neural tube defects and reduced by one-half the incidence of fetuses exhibiting axial skeletal defects. ZPN did not provide protection against the embryocidal effects of methylene blue. This study showed that transplacental exposure to methylene blue is teratogenic in the mouse. Coadministration of ZPN prevented partly methylene blue-induced teratogenesis, which supports the hypothesis that imbalance of cGMP pathway accounts, in part, for the teratogenicity of methylene blue.",

The potential adverse effects of methylene blue on the fetal growth process were also investigated. ICR (CD-I) mice were injected subcutaneously with methylene blue at 0 (vehicle), 5, 30, 50, 60 or 85 mg/kg on gestation days 15.5 and 16 (plug day = gestation day 0). Methylene blue caused the mice to deliver before gestation day 18 (term gestation). This response was observed in 45%, 50% and 83% of animals receiving methylene blue at 50, 60 or 85 mg/kg, respectively (p < 0.05 vs. controls). In a dose-dependent fashion, methylene blue induced a statistically significant (p < 0.05) derangement of the fetal growth process. The present study provides the first evidence that exposure to methylene blue during late gestation induces preterm delivery and fetal growth restriction. ...",

In the 500 mg/kg groups, one male died the first week of the study and one male and four females died the second week of the study. All rats in the 1,000 mg/kg group died by study day 10, and all rats in the 2,000 mg/kg group died by study day 6. Final mean body weights of male and female rats in the 250 and 500 mg/kg groups were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. Dosed rats developed methemoglobinemia and a regenerative Heinz body anemia. Significant increases in spleen weights occurred in all surviving dosed groups. There were also significant decreases in the thymus weights of 250 and 500 mg/kg males and 125 and 250 mg/kg females. Spleen lesions associated with methylene blue trihydrate administration included hematopoietic cell proliferation, pigmentation, lymphoid depletion of the lymphoid follicles, and capsular fibrosis. Hyperplasia of the bone marrow occurred in all dosed groups of rats. Liver lesions associated with methylene blue exposure included centrilobular necrosis in rats dying early, hematopoietic cell proliferation, and Kupffer cell pigmentation with erythrophagocytosis. /Methylene blue trihydrate/",

None of the mice in the 500, 1,000, and 2,000 mg/kg groups survived to the end of the study. In the 250 mg/kg groups, two females died on days 16 and 18 and two males died on days 6 and 13. Mean body weights of surviving dosed mice were similar to those of the vehicle controls. Thinness, abnormal respiration, hypothermia, lethargy, ataxia, and ruffled fur were observed in a few surviving animals in the 250 mg/kg groups. Hypothermia and abnormal posture were observed in mice in the 500, 1,000, and 2,000 mg/kg groups. Dosed mice developed methemoglobinemia and a regenerative Heinz body anemia. Significant increases in spleen weights occurred in all surviving dosed groups of mice compared to vehicle controls. Significant decreases occurred in the thymus weights of 250 mg/kg males and females. The heart weights of 125 and 250 mg/kg females were significantly increased. Lesions in the spleen associated with methylene blue trihydrate administration included hematopoietic cell proliferation, pigmentation, and congestion. Liver lesions associated with methylene blue trihydrate administration included periportal degeneration, hematopoietic cell proliferation, and Kupffer cell pigmentation with erythrophagocytosis. The incidences of bone marrow pigmentation were significantly increased in all dosed groups of mice. Forestomach lesions that were related to methylene blue trihydrate administration included focal ulcer, inflammation, and squamous hyperplasia. /Methylene blue trihydrate/",

A study of swim bladder non-inflation (SBN) in angelfish, Pterophyllum scalare. A normal developing primordial swim bladder was first discernable at the end of the first day post-hatch (p.h.) as a cluster of epithelial cells with a central lumen, surrounded by presumably mesenchymal cells. Initial inflation occurred on the fourth day p.h. Prior to inflation the swim bladder epithelium consisted of an outer squamous and inner columnar layer. Cells of the inner layer were filled at their basal region with an amorphous material, which disappeared upon inflation. A pneumatic duct was absent, and larvae presented no need to reach the water surface for inflation, suggesting that angelfish are pure physoclists. A model for the role of the amorphous material in normal initial inflation is proposed. Abnormal swim bladders were apparent from the fourth day p.h., and methylene blue (MB) at a concentration of 5 ppm significantly increased the prevalence of SBN. Histologically, abnormal swim bladders in larvae hatched in 5 ppm MB could not be distinguished from those in fish raised under routine conditions (0.5 ppm MB). ...MB may have a teratogenic effect in angelfish.",

The 96-hr lethal concentration (LC50) was 45 and 15 mg/L at 20 and 25 \u00b0C, respectively. The 7-day chronic value for survival under laboratory light and low light was the same (2.1 mg/L). However, under laboratory light, larval growth was impaired at lower concentrations (chronic value = 0.6 mg/L) than under low light (chronic value = 2.1 mg/L). To assess prior methylene blue treatment on larval sensitivity, embryos, larvae <24 hr old, and embryos followed by larvae were treated with 3 mg/L methylene blue. Cadmium LC50 values were similar between methylene blue-treated and untreated control groups. When larvae treated with methylene blue as embryos were subchronically exposed to an effluent, survival was similar to that of the untreated group. However, dry weight of the treated larvae was significantly lower. Differences in dry weight between treated and untreated groups were reduced as the age of the larvae at test initiation increased. Treatment of incubating embryos using 3 mg/L methylene blue does not appear to affect larvae sensitivity to cadmium but may affect the growth of larvae used in subchronic testing.",

However, very little is known about the toxicity of methylene blue to nitrifying micro-organisms. Here, /is reported/ the susceptibility of six bacterial and one archaeal ammonia-oxidizing micro-organisms to methylene blue within the range of 10 ppb to 10 ppm. Remarkably high susceptibility was observed in the archaeal species Nitrosopumilus maritimus compared to the bacterial species. Ammonia oxidation by Nitrosopumilus maritimus was inhibited 65% by 10 ppb of methylene blue. Of the bacterial species examined, Nitrosococcus oceani was the most resistant to methylene blue toxicity. For similar inhibition of Nitrosococcus oceani (75% inhibition), one thousand times more methylene blue (10 ppm) was needed. The examination of single cell viability on Nitrosomonas marina demonstrated that methylene blue is lethal to the cells rather than reducing their single cell ammonia oxidation activity. The level of susceptibility to methylene blue was related to the cell volume, intracytoplasmic membrane arrangement and the evolutionary lineage of nitrifying micro-organisms. Our findings are relevant for effectively using methylene blue in various aquaculture settings by helping minimize its impact on nitrifiers during the treatment of fish diseases. In the future, resistant nitrifiers such as Nitrosococcus oceani may be purposely added to aquaculture systems to maintain nitrification activity during treatments with methylene blue. The susceptibility of six bacterial and one archaeal nitrifying micro-organisms to methylene blue was tested. Remarkably high susceptibility was observed in the archaeal species compared to the bacterial species. The level of resistance to methylene blue was related to the cell volume, cytomembrane system and the taxonomic position of the nitrifying micro-organisms. This may be significant in the design and management of engineered nitrification systems and the stability of the nitrification process in various ecosystems if these systems are exposed to harmful chemicals or toxins.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.0X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methylene blue will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase methylene blue will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hrs. Particulate-phase methylene blue will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. The trihydrate of methylene blue has UV absorption maxima 688 and 609 nm and, therefore, methylene blue may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methylene blue is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 8000. The estimated pKa of methylene blue is 3.14, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Methylene blue is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. More than 90% of color removal efficiency was observed when using an anaerobic sludge reactor and a low methylene blue concentration, suggesting that biodegradation may occur in soil or water under specific conditions. If released into water, methylene blue is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The pKa indicates methylene blue will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to methylene blue may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methylene blue is produced or used. The general public is not likely to be exposed to methylene blue unless by direct medical treatment. (SRC)",

The estimated pKa of methylene blue is 3.14(3), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. Methylene blue is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 7.0X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2). More than 90% of color removal efficiency was observed when using an anaerobic sludge reactor and a low methylene blue concentration(5), suggesting that biodegradation may occur in soil under specific conditions(SRC).",

An estimated pKa of 3.14(3) indicates methylene blue will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 0.75(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). More than 90% of color removal efficiency was observed when using an anaerobic sludge reactor and a low methylene blue concentration(5), suggesting that biodegradation may occur in water under specific conditions(SRC).",

Vapor-phase methylene blue is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.1X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase methylene blue may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). The trihydrate of methylene blue has UV absorption maxima at 688 and 609 nm(3) which suggests that methylene blue may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The UASB reactor was operated under batch condition with total treatment volume of 3 L and operation time of 24 hrs per batch. It was found that the color of MB disappeared within a few minutes after entering into the UASB reactor due to reduction by anaerobic biomass. However, the reduced MB was re-oxidized again by air after discharged from the reactor and thus caused low color removal efficiency. The presence of suitable amount of organic content (sucrose and peptone) as an electron donor played an important factor for color removal. It was observed that more than 90% of color removal efficiency was achieved in the UASB reactor with 0.627 mmol/L of MB concentration and the presence of low amount of organic content (< 0.45 g COD/(L d)). Biological dye reduction kinetics depends on the concentration of dye and reducing equivalents. The kinetic behavior of MB biodegradation by microbes was also investigated to determine the model involved in the process.",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). Methylene blue is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). The trihydrate of methylene blue has UV absorption maxima at 668 and 609 nm(3,4) and, therefore, methylene blue may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Methylene blue is reduced to a colorless form then oxidized back to the dye, imparting good fastness to oxidation. The compound is also used as a photosensitizer(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If released to the atmosphere, dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate will exist in both the vapor phase and the particulate phase based on an experimental vapor pressure of 2.5X10-6 mm Hg. In the vapor phase, it should react slowly with hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of 36 days. Particulate phase dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate may be removed physically from air by wet and dry deposition. Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate is expected to be essentially immobile in soil based on an estimated Koc of 5900; it may bind strongly to organic matter or clay in the soil. This compound will biodegrade with products of monomethyl tetrachloroterephthalate and tetrachloroterephthalic acid. Half-lives ranging from 11 to 289 days depending on the soil temperature and moisture conditions (optimal conditions, 20-30 \u00b0C, 0.2 kg H2O/kg soil) have been reported. Volatilization of dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate from moist soil surfaces is also possible. During a 21 day period, 36-52% of the total measured dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate loss from soil was accounted for by volatilization and 26% by breakdown in soil. Photodegradation on soil surfaces may occur with a half-life of 5 hours (reaction products include monomethyl tetrachloroterephthalate, tetrachloroterephthalic acid, and 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene). In water, dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate should bind strongly to particulate matter and sediment in the water column based on an estimated Koc value of 5900. Biodegradation may occur based on evidence from several soil studies. Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate should bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms based on an estimated BCF value of 1300; this compound has been detected in fish at several locations. Exposure to dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate by the general population is through the ingestion of leafy and root vegetables and fish, the drinking of well water, and, in some agricultural areas, by the inhalation of air.

Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate moves minimally in the soil profile due to its adsorption to clay and organic matter(4). Some loss of dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate due to volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be possible based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.18X10-6 atm-cu m/mol. In a field experiment, the loss of dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate followed an apparent first-order dissipation rate for 85 days following application with a calculated soil half-life of 33.8 days. The total estimated loss by volatilization from the soil surface for the 21 day sampling period was 0.74 or 1.06 kg/ha(5). Approximately 36-52% of the total measured dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate loss from soil was accounted for by volatilization and 26% by breakdown in soil during this 21 day period(5). A majority of the loss by flux occurred following irrigation; when the soil surface was dry, loss was minimal(5). Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate was sprayed as a 75% wettable powder onto a moist Hatboro silt loam (23% sand, 57% silt, 20% clay, 1.2% organic matter(6). A 2% volatilization loss of this pesticide required 34 hours(6); a 50% volatilization loss of dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate required 8 days following surface application in the same study(7). Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate-treated soil (fine, sandy loam) under conditions of both unrestricted and restricted volatilization and microbial degradation (at 60 and 90 \u00b0F) showed results indicating that this compound is not subject to large losses due to volatilization or microbial action over a period of 70 days(8).",

Two studies measured the optimal temperature and moisture conditions for the biodegradation of dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate(2,3); at 20-30 \u00b0C and with 0.2 kg H2O/kg soil present a half-life of 11 days was obtained. At 10-15 \u00b0C and only 0.1 kg H2O/kg soil dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate had a half-life of 105 days(2). However, land which had been sprayed with dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate for five years and then not sprayed for the following three years still had measurable residues of this compound present(4). On soil surfaces, dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate may photodegrade.

Biodegradation of dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate is also expected to be a major fate process based on aerobic soil biodegradation studies. Half-lives for this compound in soil (dependent on temperature and moisture conditions) ranged from 11 to 289 days(4-8); the degradation of dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate occurs by successive dealkylations of the two methyl groups at the ester linkages with the formation of monomethyl tetrachloroterephthalate and tetrachloroterephthalic acid(4). Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate is expected to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms based on an estimated BCF value of 1300(2,9,SRC); this compound has been detected in fish at several locations in the US(9-18).",

Metabolites were monomethyl tetrachloroterephthalate which quickly hydrolyzed to the di-acid; there was no loss of the mono-acid metabolite over a 300 day period(1). Nearly 33% of added 14C-labeled dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate in Plainfield sand was lost within 15 days, only 25% of the 14C activity was the parent compound(2). Soil used to grow one-year pine seedlings showed a similar degradation pattern. Ten day old pine seedlings showed 20% of the total 14C activity was lost after 15 days, 30% of the 14C activity remaining was intact dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate, 50% of the remaining activity was 14C labeled degradation products(2). After 120 days, 12-18% of intact dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate was still present(4).",

New York soil which had been treated for five previous years with dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (19 lb/acre annually) had nearly 3 times more actinomycetes present than soil which was untreated(2). Pure cultures were incubated for 96 hours with dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate(10, 100, 1000, and 10000 mg/l) present as the sole carbon source and with one of twenty soil isolates of bacteria or actinomycetes. 25, 90, and 90% of the isolated actinomycetes were able to utilize dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate at concentrations of 100, 1000, and 10000 mg/l, respectively; 5, 15, and 15% of the isolated bacteria were able to utilize this compound at concentrations of 100, 1000, and 10000 mg/l, respectively(2). Using 36Cl-labeled dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate it was determined that little if any chlorine is freed from the ring structure during microbial degradation(2).",

Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate was photodecomposed to monomethyl tetrachloroterephthalic acid and tetrachloroterephthalic acid following exposure for two hours, and 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene as well was formed following four hours. After 64 hours, more unidentified products were noted(2). In methanol, dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate does not absorb above 330 nm(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated as 4.41X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4,SRC).

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

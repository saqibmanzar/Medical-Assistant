Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The short-term exposure (also called acute exposure) is a short contact with a chemical. It may last a few seconds or a few hours. For example, it might take a few minutes to clean windows with ammonia, use nail polish remover or spray a can of paint. The fumes someone might inhale during these activities are examples of acute exposures.",

Nitriles may polymerize in the presence of metals and some metal compounds. They are incompatible with acids; mixing nitriles with strong oxidizing acids can lead to extremely violent reactions. Nitriles are generally incompatible with other oxidizing agents such as peroxides and epoxides. The combination of bases and nitriles can produce hydrogen cyanide. Nitriles are hydrolyzed in both aqueous acid and base to give carboxylic acids (or salts of carboxylic acids). These reactions generate heat. Peroxides convert nitriles to amides. Nitriles can react vigorously with reducing agents. Acetonitrile and propionitrile are soluble in water, but nitriles higher than propionitrile have low aqueous solubility. They are also insoluble in aqueous acids.",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

All the test nitriles liberated cyanide both in vivo and in vitro, with the exception of benzonitrile, although the extent of liberation and the effect of carbon tetrachloride pretreatment on the mortality of animals differed among nitriles. From these results, test compounds were tentatively divided into 3 groups. In group 1, acute toxicity was greatly reduced by carbon tetrachloride pretreatment, in group 2, toxicity was not significantly changed or was somewhat enhanced, and in group 3, benzonitrile only, toxicity was clearly enhanced. The amount of cyanide was higher at death in the brains of mice given group 1 compounds, the level being comparable to that found in mice killed by dosing with potassium cyanide. The relation between log (1/LD50) and log p for the compounds in group 1 fitted a parabolic plot, while that for compounds in group 2 was linear. For most nitriles, the in vitro metabolism was inhibited when the incubation mixture contained either SKF-525A, carbon monoxide, or microsomes from mice treated with carbon tetrachloride. When mice were closed with ethyl alcohol, metabolic enhancement of nitriles was seen compared with the control. However, ethyl alcohol, when added to the incubation mixture, inhibited the in vitro metabolism of nitriles. /Nitriles/",

Massive cyanide overdoses have survived with only good supportive care. Immediate attention should be directed toward assisted ventilation, admin of 100% oxygen, insertion of iv lines, & institution of cardiac monitoring. Obtain an arterial blood gas immediately & correct any severe metabolic acidosis (pH below 7.15). Oxygen (100%) should be used routinely in moderate or severely symptomatic patients even in the presence of a normal pO2, since 100% O2 incr O2 delivery, may reactivate cyanide-inhibited mitochondrial enzymes, & potentiates the effect of thiosulfate. Avoid mouth to mouth resuscitation during CPR in order to prevent self poisoning. /Cyanides/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 19.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates butanenitrile will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase butanenitrile will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 32 days. If released to soil, butanenitrile is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 46. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.23X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Butanenitrile may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Microorganisms can hydrolyze nitriles, such as butanenitrile, predominately to carboxylic acids plus ammonium ions. For example, a mixed microbial culture, isolated from an environment contaminated with organic cyanides, was able to biodegrade butanenitrile. If released into water, butanenitrile is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 hours and 8 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Chemical hydrolysis is expected to be slow based on a chemical hydrolysis half-life of >150,000 yrs for acetonitrile. Occupational exposure to butanenitrile may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where butanenitrile is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of butanenitrile from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 5.23X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). The potential for volatilization of butanenitrile from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 19.5 mm Hg(5). Microorganisms hydrolyze nitriles predominately to carboxylic acids plus ammonium ions(6,7). A mixed microbial culture, isolated from an environment contaminated with organic cyanides and PCBs, utilized butanenitrile as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen(8). The mixed microbial culture was grown for 48 hrs at pH 7 with 1 g/l of butanenitrile; the final pH and ammonia concn were determined to be 8.69 and 74.6 umol/ml, respectively(8). Thus, butanenitrile may be expected to biodegrade in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.23X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 hours and 8 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Microorganisms hydrolyze nitriles predominately to carboxylic acids plus ammonium ions(7,8). A mixed microbial culture, isolated from an environment contaminated with organic cyanides and PCBs, utilized butanenitrile as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen(9). The mixed microbial culture was grown for 48 hrs at pH 7 with 1 g/l of butanenitrile; the final pH and ammonia concn were determined to be 8.69 and 74.6 umol/ml, respectively(9). Thus, butanenitrile may be expected to biodegrade in water(SRC).",

A predictive method based upon evaluated biodegradation data and the fact that butanenitrile contains a nitrile substructure predicts that butanenitrile has a high probability of biodegrading fast in the environment(3). A mixed microbial culture, isolated from an environment contaminated with organic cyanides and PCBs, utilized butanenitrile as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen(4). The mixed microbial culture was grown for 48 hrs at pH 7 with 1 g/l of butanenitrile; the final pH and ammonia concn were determined to be 8.69 and 74.6 umol/ml, respectively(4). Isobutanenitrile, a chemical whose structure is similar to butanenitrile, has been shown to biodegrade readily using the Japanese MITI protocol (2 wk incubation, 100 ppm concn) with theoretical BODs of 53.9-66.3%(5,6). In addition, acetonitrile, which is structurally similar to butanenitrile, has been shown to biodegrade readily in river water, especially with acclimated microbes(7,8). Thus, butanenitrile may be expected to biodegrade in the environment(SRC).",

Butanenitrile was toxic to an activated sludge seed from a Franklin, TN waste treatment facility(1). Butanenitrile was poorly oxidized during 24-hr incubations using a Warburg respirometer, 500 ppm concns, and activated sludge seeds from three different Ohio waste treatment facilities(2). These short-term incubation and high butanenitrile concn studies(1,2) may not represent environmental biodegradation since the high concns may have been toxic to the microbes and/or the microbes were given inadequate time to acclimate to the butanenitrile(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

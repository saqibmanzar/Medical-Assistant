Catechol-O-methyl transferase is the enzyme in charge of 3-methoxytyrosine formation, which is produced from L-DOPA in many organs. Nevertheless, its half-life (15 hours approximately) is longer than the L-DOPA 's half-life, which is about one hour. This means that it is accumulated in the plasma and the brain of chronic L-DOPA therapy patients such as people suffering from Parkinson's disease. 3-Methoxytyrosine has some effects on L-DOPA related motor dysfunction, inhibition of striatal uptake of tyrosine, competition with L-DOPA for the blood\u2013brain barrier transporter system and inhibition of dopamine release. 3-Methoxytyrosine increases homocysteine levels, and this amino acid induces cardiovascular disease and neuronal damage. Some other toxic effects could be oxidative DNA damage which can cause cell death, a decrease in locomotor activities and diminishment in mitochondrial membrane potential. (Wikipedia)",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

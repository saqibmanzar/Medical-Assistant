When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

Controls (n= 20) received saline sc. By wk 18, all rats that had received cysteamine had body and liver wt that were slightly increased over those of sodium chloride treated rats. Pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions staining positive for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were examined by histochemical techniques. In wk 18, quantitative histological analysis showed that prolonged administration /of/ cysteamine resulted in a significant reduction in the number of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-positive and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrog enase-positive hepatic lesions (from 31.4/sq cm for saline controls to 3 to 15.9/sq cm, respectively). Histologically, hepatocellular carcinomas were significantly fewer and smaller in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-positive and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-positive lesions in rats treated with cysteamine than in untreated rats.

To initiate hepatocarcinogenesis, mice were treated with N-nitrosomorpholine (160 mg/L, in drinking water for 7 weeks), as in previous studies with the rat model. After a treatment-free interval of 22 weeks, 3,4,3'-4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl was administered (5 x 50 mg/kg, every 3 days), and liver foci were analysed 10 weeks after the start of 3,4,3',4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl treatment. The number of G6Pase-negative and -positive foci per liver was markedly diminished following 3,4,3',4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl treatment (to 32% and 57%, respectively). On the other hand, the mean volume of the remaining G6Pase-altered foci was enhanced, owing to an increase in the percentage of foci of large size (greater than 0.5 sq mm). Throughout the experimental period of 39 weeks prolonged liver injury due to N-nitrosomorpholine and 3,4,3',4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl treatment was demonstrated by histology and by elevated serum levels of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase. In contrast to the rat system, 3,4,3',4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl exhibited opposing effects on liver foci in the mouse model: (a) moderate tumor-promoting effects and (b) cytotoxic effects in N-nitrosomorpholine injured liver, leading to decreased numbers of liver foci.",

Carcinogenesis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by application of N-nitrosomorpholine for 7 weeks. Afterwards, the animals received fructose in the drinking water (120 g/L) and food ad libitum (group I) or tap water and food ad libitum (group II). The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in rats treated with N-nitrosomorpholine plus fructose was 46% as compared to 24% in animals receiving N-nitrosomorpholine alone (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the incidences of other malignancies between the groups (group I: 32.1%, group II: 32.0%). Morphometric evaluation of preneoplastic liver lesions indicated the enhancing effect of the fructose treatment several months before malignant tumors appeared. As early as 6 weeks after treatment the hepatic parenchyma occupied by focal lesions was increased from 6.7% in the animals which had received N-nitrosomorpholine alone to 8.5% (P < 0.05) in animals having received N-nitrosomorpholine plus fructose. This increase was predominantly caused by an increase in glycogen storing foci (P < 0.0005). In addition, the fructose treatment caused a histochemically detectable increase in the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in both the hepatocytes of the focal lesions and the surrounding parenchyma. In the N-nitrosomorpholine plus fructose group the activity of the glucose-6-phosphatase in the foci was frequently approximately equal to the activity in the parenchyma of untreated controls.",

Exposure to this compound is considered to be a potential health hazard to humans. There is, however, considerable evidence that the effect of many carcinogenic agents can be markedly influenced or altered by various natural substances. The objective of this study was to assess the DNA-protective and anticlastogenic effects of the derivative of a natural compound, carboxymethyl chitin-glucan (CM-CG), against genotoxicity of N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) in human hepatoma cells HepG2 and hamster lung cells V79 cultured in vitro. The exponentially growing cells were pre-treated during 24 h with three different concentrations of CM-CG (150, 750 and 1500 mg/mL) and then treated with different concentrations of NMOR. DNAprotective effects of CM-CG were evaluated by single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE, comet assay) and anticlastogenic effects by chromosomal aberration assay. At the SCGE assay a short-term (30 min) and at the chromosomal aberration assay a continuous treatment with NMOR was used. In both HepG2 and V79 cells pre-treated with CM-CG, a significant decrease of the percentage of DNA lesions induced by NMOR was observed along with a reduction of NMOR-induced chromosomal aberrations. We did not find any substantial differences between the genotoxic effects of NMOR on HepG2 and V79 cells, which have different histopathological origins and different levels of metabolizing enzymes. Three different concentrations of CM-CG exerted a similar protective effect against NMOR-induced DNA lesions and chromosomal aberrations in both HepG2 and V79 cells.",

N-nitrosomorpholine, a frequently used genotoxic model carcinogen, was applied via drinking water at 120 mg/L to male Wistar rats for 7 weeks followed by an exposure-free period of 43 weeks. Seven specimens of each treatment group (untreated control and 120 mg/L N-nitrosomorpholine in drinking water) were sacrificed at nine time points during and after N-nitrosomorpholine treatment. Individual samples from the liver were prepared for histological and toxicogenomic analyses. For histological detection of preneoplastic and neoplastic tissue areas, sections were stained using antibodies against the placental form of glutathione-S-transferase (GST-P). Gene and protein expression profiles of liver tissue homogenates were analyzed using RG-U34A Affymetrix rat gene chips and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomics, respectively. In order to compare results obtained by histopathology, transcriptomics and proteomics, GST-P-stained liver sections were evaluated morphometrically, which revealed a parallel time course of the area fraction of preneoplastic lesions and gene plus protein expression patterns. On the transcriptional level, an increase of hepatic GST-P expression was detectable as early as 3 weeks after study onset. Comparing deregulated genes and proteins, eight species were identified which showed a corresponding expression profile on both expression levels. Functional analysis suggests that these genes and corresponding proteins may be useful as biomarkers of early hepatocarcinogenesis.",

This compound may also be released to the environment as a result of nitrosation of morpholine. High concentrations of acids, nitrates, and nitrites in process streams provide excellent conditions for nitrosation to occur. N-Nitrosomorpholine has been detected as a by-product of surface water disinfection treatment processes such as chlorination. If released to air, N-nitrosomorpholine's estimated vapor pressure of 0.036 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates this compound will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase N-nitrosomorpholine will react with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of 5 hr. In air, N-nitrosomorpholine is expected to photolyze rapidly in sunlight; the half-life is expected to be similar to dimethylnitrosamine, 30 minutes in full sunlight. If released to soil, N-nitrosomorpholine is expected to have very high mobility based upon estimated Koc values of 22 and 6. Although N-nitrosomorpholine's estimated vapor pressure and measured Henry's Law constant of 2.45X10-8 atm-cu m/mole suggest that volatilization from dry and moist soil is not expected to occur, inhalation toxicity studies found that N-nitrosomorpholine is volatile at room temperatures with inhalation exposure possible. N-Nitrosomorpholine is expected to photolyze on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight, particularly under acidic conditions or in the presence of radical scavengers. If released to water, N-nitrosomorpholine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its estimated Koc values. N-Nitrosomorpholine's measured Henry's Law constant indicates volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to occur. An estimated BCF of 3 indicates the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Photolysis is expected to occur in surface water. Occupational exposure to N-nitrosomorpholine may occur in the synthesis of N-nitrosomorpholine, its use in the rubber industry, or in leather tanneries. Exposure would be via inhalation of dust particles or dermal contact. The general population may be exposed to N-nitrosomorpholine from inhalation of air in new cars probably due to volatilization from rubber materials found in the car or in indoor air that is contaminated possibly due to cooking. The general population may also be exposed by ingesting food items contaminated with N-nitrosomorpholine such as cured meat contained in rubber netting. Infants may be exposed to N-nitrosomorpholine through use of rubber nipples for baby bottles containing this compound. N-Nitrosomorpholine may also be formed in vivo in humans from morpholine and nitrite or nitrite precursors. (SRC)",

Morpholine is used as an algicide in cooling water, and as a corrosion inhibitor, rubber accelerator, solvent, optical brightener in detergents, and organic intermediate(1,2,6). High concentrations of acids, nitrates, and nitrites in process streams provide excellent conditions for nitrosation to occur(1). N-Nitrosomorpholine is an impurity in morpholine, 0.8 ug/g, the rubber cross linking accelerator bismorpholinecarbamylsulfenamide, 0.4 to 0.7 ug/g, and the rubber curing accelerator 4-morpholinyl-2-benzothiazole disulfide, 3 to 4 ug/g(3,4). N-Nitrosomorpholine may volatilize during use of these compounds in the production of rubber products(4,SRC). N-Nitrosomorpholine may also be generated by transnitrosation of morpholine via thermal decomposition of the retarding agent N-nitrosodiphenylamine(4). Experiments designed to determine the amount of N-nitrosomorpholine produced during the vulcanization processed found that 0.2 mg were produced per kg of rubber used(7). For this experiment 0.7, 0.5 and 1.5 parts per hundred rubber of 2-(4-morpholine)-benzothiazole sulfide, dithio-bis-morpholine and sulfur was used in a rubber press with 20 minutes of heating at 145 \u00b0C and 20 min of cooling. Use of rubber netting to package cured meats can lead to the formation of nitrosamines in finished meat products(5). N-Nitrosomorpholine has been detected as a by-product of surface water disinfection treatment processes such as chlorination, chlorine dioxide, ultraviolet and advanced oxidation processes(8).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). N-Nitrosomorpholine in water has a UV absorption maximum at 346 nm(2), indicating that it has the potential to undergo direct photolysis in air, water, and on soil surfaces(SRC). Nitrosamines photolyze rapidly in sunlight in aqueous solution and in the gas phase forming an amino radical and NO(2-4). Under neutral conditions and in the absence of radical scavengers, rapid recombination of the amino radicals and nitric oxide formed during photolysis gives the nitrosamine an appearance of stability. In the presence of radical scavengers decay is rapid(3). At lower pH, a variety of photoproducts attributed to photoelimination, photoreduction, and photooxidation are formed(3). In air, N-nitrosomorpholine is expected to photolyze rapidly in sunlight; the half-life is expected to be similar to dimethylnitrosamine, 30 minutes in full sunlight(4). The amino radical formed is subsequently expected to react with O2 and NOx(4). Chemical hydrolysis of N-nitrosomorpholine is not expected to be an important environmental fate process(2).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

For control purposes, ambient air samples taken at the new car dealers where the cars were obtained, contained no N-nitrosamines(3). In 1978, N-nitrosomorpholine was analyzed for but not found in air outside a tire chemical factory and an aircraft tire factory located in Ohio, detection limit 0.05 ug/cu m(2). As part of an EPA study of air quality in public buildings, six buildings, a new hospital, office and nursing home and another office, office/school, and nursing home, a screening analysis of nitrosamines was performed at each location for all monitoring trips (10 in all)(4). During this screening, only N-nitrosomorpholine was found in any of the samples, and only in samples from the old office building. Concentrations did not appear to vary between sampling locations and daytime and nighttime means (standard deviation) were 0.17 (0.09) and 0.36 (0.13) ng/cu m. The building contained a fast food restaurant on the ground floor and a cooking odor could be detected throughout the building. It is thought that cooking at the restaurant could be the source of N-nitrosomorpholine thoughout the building(4).",

Boiler water additives use in two food production plants were found to contain 1 to 4.6 ppb N-nitrosomorpholine as an impurity(2). However, these additives were used only in extremely low concentrations (10 lb/2X10+6 lb of steam); therefore, detectable levels (>0.5 ppb) of N-nitrosomorpholine were not expected to occur in the finished product(2).

Nursing babies may be exposed to N-nitrosomorpholine through use of rubber nipples for baby bottles(1). N-Nitrosamines can also form in vivo from amines (in the case of N-nitrosomorpholine, morpholine) and nitrite or nitrite precursor(6). Nitrite can be produced from nitrate in saliva(6). In addition, nitric oxide, which is widely produced in the body, may react with oxygen to form N2O3, a nitrosating agent at neutral or near-neutral pH(6). Occupational exposure to N-nitrosomorpholine may occur during its production or during its use in leather tanneries or in rubber plants via inhalation or dermal contact(5).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

However, cyanogen breaks down in aqueous solution into cyanide ion (CN-1) and OCN- ions. The rate of the breakdown depends on pH and is faster in basic media (e.g., hydrogen cyanide is in equilibrium as H+ and CN- in blood with a pH of 7.38 - 7.44) than in acidic media (e.g., hydrogen cyanide is the only species in stomach contents at a pH of 3). The amount of cyanide ion formed within a body tissue or fluid as a result of exposure to cyanogen has been reported; however, the amount varies with type of body tissue and fluid.

The limiting factor under normal conditions is the availability of a sulfane as a substrate for rhodanese, and sulfur is administered therapeutically as sodium thiosulfate to accelerate this reaction. The lethal dose of cyanide is time dependent because of the ability of the body to detoxify small amounts of cyanide via the rhodanese-catalyzed reaction with sulfane. A given amount of cyanide absorbed slowly may cause no biological effects even though the same amount administered over a very short period of time may be lethal. /Hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen chloride/",

Of all the seven procedures studied, the modified Roberts-Jackson method is the best. It gives complete recovery for all but one of the simple cyanides without decomposing the complex cyanides. ... It has the unique ability to perform accurately in the presence of both sulfide and thiocyanate. A lower limit of 2 ppb + or - 1 ppb is possible with a precision of + or - 10% above 10 ppb. ...

The method detects inorganic cyanides that are present as either simple soluble salts or complex radicals. It is used to determine values for both total cyanide and cyanide amenable to chlorination; it is not intended to determine if a waste is hazardous by the characteristic of reactivity. The cyanide, as hydrocyanic acid, is released by refluxing the sample with strong acid and distillation of the HCN into an absorber-scrubber containing sodium hydroxide solution. The cyanide ion in the absorbing solution is then manually determined colorimetrically by converting the cyanide to cyanogen chloride by reaction with chloramine-T at a pH less than 8 without hydrolyzing the cyanate. ... Color is formed on addition of the pyridine-barbituric acid reagent. In a single laboratory, using mixed domestic and industrial waste samples at concentrations of 0.06, 0.13, 0.28, and 0.62 mg CN/l, the standard deviations were + or - 0.005, + or - 0.007, + or - 0.031, and + or - 0.094, respectively. In a single laboratory, using mixed industrial and domestic waste samples at concentrations of 0.28 and 0.62 mg CN/l, recoveries were 85% and 102%, respectively. /Total and Amenable Cyanide/",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled material. FOR CHLOROSILANES, use alcohol-resistant foam to reduce vapors. If possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid. Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. (ERG, 2024)",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

Rats injected with an LD100 intravenous dose of cyanide were treated with Stroma-Free Methemoglobin Solution equal to 1.5% of their total body hemoglobin. There was a highly significant increase in the survival rate of the treated group compared to saline controls. The potential advantages of Stroma-Free Methemoglobin Solution over current antidotes include an immediate onset of action, rapid elimination of cyanide from the body and a mode of action that doesn't compromise any of the patients' oxygen carrying capacity. Stroma-Free Methemoglobin Solution shows promise as a significant adjunct in the treatment of cyanide poisoning. /Cyanide/",

These patients or those who have arrhythmias may be seriously acidotic; consider giving, under medical supervision, each patient 1 mEq/kg intravenous sodium bicarbonate. ...  When possible, treatment with cyanide antidotes should be given under medical supervision to unconscious victims who have known or strongly suspected cyanide poisoning. Cyanide antidotes - amyl nitrite perles and iv infusions of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate - are packaged in the cyanide antidote kit. Amyl nitrite perles should be broken onto a gauze pad and held under the nose, over the Ambu-valve intake, or placed under the lip of the face mask....  .

Mild effects may be apparent at concentrations of 0.5-1.0 ug/mL, and concentrations of 2.5 ug/mL and higher are associated with coma, convulsions and death. 2. Acidosis. Metabolic acidosis with a high concentration of lactic acid (lactic acidosis) or a metabolic acidosis with an unexplained high anion gap (if the means to measure lactic acid are not available) may be present. Because oxygen cannot be utilized, anaerobic metabolism with the production of lactic acid replaces aerobic metabolism. Lactic acidosis, however, may reflect other disease states and is not specific for cyanide poisoning. 3. Oxygen content of venous blood greater than normal. This also is a result of poisoning of the intramitochondrial respiratory chain and the resulting failure of cells to extract oxygen from arterial blood. This finding is also not specific for cyanide poisoning. /Hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen chloride/",

Its former use as a fumigant resulted in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4300 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cyanogen will exist solely in the gas phase in the atmosphere. Gas-phase cyanogen will be slowly degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be greater than 530 days. Cyanogen does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, cyanogen is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8.3. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.54X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Cyanogen will volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, cyanogen is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 3.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis under environmental conditions is expected to be an important fate process since cyanogen slowly hydrolyzes in aqueous solution. Occupational exposure to cyanogen may occur through inhalation or through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyanogen is produced or used. The most likely pathway by which the general public may have been  exposed to cyanogen was by inhalation due to its formation from the breakdown of nitrogen-containing additives during the combustion of gasoline.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

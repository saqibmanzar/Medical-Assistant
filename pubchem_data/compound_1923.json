When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Non-aqueous titration methods have been described to determine 8-hydroxyquinoline and its oxidation products and to determine 8-hydroxyquinoline and some of its metal chelates. An aqueous titration method for the determination of 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate has been outlined and it can be determined fluorimetrically as its chelate compound with tin(2+). A fluorimetric determination of 8-hydroxyquinoline is based on its luminescence in sulfuric acid at 77 deg K and has a sensitivity of 0.12 uM. A spectrophotometric method for the determination of 8-hydroxyquinoline as the copper chelate can be used in the presence of some other metals. Paper, thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography can also be used to determine 8-hydroxyquinoline.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Quinolinol is found on List D. Case No: 4047; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered. Therefore, we are characterizing the case as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): quinolinol; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered products. Thus, we characterize it as \"cancelled.\"",

After 15 min exposure to 5 uM iron(III) citrate or iron chelate, the cellular levels of iron were found to be three times higher in cells subjected to iron-8HQ than in cells subjected to iron(III) citrate, iron-EDTA or iron-NTA. Exposure to iron-8HQ caused extensive DNA-strand breakage, whereas no such breakage was found in cells exposed to iron-EDTA or iron-NTA. The DNA damage caused by iron-8HQ increased with time and dose, and DNA-strand breakage was clearly demonstrable in cells after 15 min exposure to as little as 0.1 uM iron-8HQ. Moreover, iron-8HQ was strongly toxic to the cells and inhibited their growth after exposure. Along with the formation of DNA-strand breaks, the concentration of cellular malondialdehyde increased four-fold after exposure to iron-8HQ and two-fold after exposure to iron-EDTA or iron-NTA, suggesting that reactive oxygen metabolites might be involved in the toxic action. Moreover, both iron-EDTA and iron-NTA caused a considerable hydroxylation of deoxyguanosine (dG) residues in DNA in vitro, whereas iron(III) citrate and iron-8HQ only caused a minor hydroxylation of dG. This points to the possibility that iron-8HQ-mediated DNA-strand breakage in cells might be due to the action of a metal-bound oxyl radical formed from the iron-8HQ complex rather than to the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Altogether, these findings indicate that iron bound to the lipophilic chelator, 8HQ, has strong toxic properties and that it may cause substantial DNA-strand breakage and lipid peroxidation in living cells.",

It's former use as a fungicide may have resulted in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.66X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 8-hydroxyquinoline will exist solely as a vapor. Vapor-phase 8-hydroxyquinoline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.0 hrs. 8-Hydroxyquinoline is expected to undergo photolysis in the atmosphere based upon aquatic photolytic experiments. The half-life for the photolytic degradation of 8-hydroxyquinoline in aqueous solution illuminated with filtered light, simulating daylight, ranged from 40-64 hours. If released to soil, 8-hydroxyquinoline is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3,000. Volatilization from water and moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.7X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation in soil or water is not likely to be an important environmental fate process based on a 0% theoretical BOD using sewage sludge. If released into water, 8-hydroxyquinoline is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 8-hydroxyquinoline may have occured through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 8-hydroxyquinoline was produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 8-hydroxyquinoline is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.0 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.0X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) determined using a structure estimation method(3). 8-Hydroxyquinoline is expected to undergo photolysis in the atmosphere based upon aquatic photolytic experiments.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

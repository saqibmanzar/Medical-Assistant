For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

These were products of hydroxylation of the 3-ethylpiperidine-2,6-dione residue, namely 3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypiperidine-2,6-dione and its acetylamino analog, 3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-(1-hydroxyethyl)piperidine-2,6-dione, and 3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-(2-carboxamidoethyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-one, the lactone formed by rearrangement of 3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperidine-2,6-dione. ...  These new metabolites were minor constituents compared with aminoglutethimide and with the previously identified major metabolites 3-(4-acetylaminophenyl)-3-ethylpiperidine-2,6-dione and 3-(4-hydroxylaminophenyl)-3-ethylpiperidine-2,6-dione. There were marked species differences between rat and human inasmuch as almost all the metabolites in the urine of the rat were N-acetylated whereas most of the human metabolites were not. However, 5-hydroxylation of the piperidinedione residue was stereoselective in the same sense in both species, the cis isomer being formed exclusively. Synthetic cis-3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypiperidine-2,6-dione did not inhibit the activity of the target enzyme systems desmolase and aromatase in vitro, and therefore, like other metabolites so far described, is an inactivation product of the drug.",

The metabolite was isolated by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography, and characterized by comparison of its mass spectrum and chromatographic properties with those of the synthetic compound. Hydroxylaminoglutethimide is unstable; it is readily oxidized to nitrosoglutethimide and disproportionates in the mass spectrometer into this compound and aminoglutethimide. In none of four patients studied was the metabolite detected in the urine after the first dose of the drug. In one patient it appeared after the second dose and in two more within seven to eight days suggesting that its formation is drug-induced, and that it may be the metabolite responsible for the diminished half-life of aminoglutethimide during chronic therapy. The profile of metabolites from one patient, examined by high-performance liquid chromatography after the first dose and again after six weeks of therapy afforded evidence that the formation of hydroxylaminoglutethimide was at the expense of a major metabolite N-acetylaminoglutethimide.",

HxAG is the product of a major AG-induced metabolic pathway since the ratio [HxAG]/[AG] rises with time. In contrast the ratio [N-AcAG]/[AG] decreases with time. A rapid, simple colorimetric assay has been used to quantify HxAG in urine from both male and female patients receiving a range of doses of AG and to show that induced metabolism is a general phenomenon even at low doses (125 mg twice daily).",

Specifically, the drug binds to and inhibits aromatase which is essential for the generation of estrogens from androstenedione and testosterone. A decrease in adrenal secretion of cortisol is followed by an increased secretion of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which will overcome the blockade of adrenocortical steroid synthesis by aminoglutethimide. The compensatory increase in ACTH secretion can be suppressed by the simultaneous administration of hydrocortisone. Since aminoglutethimide increases the rate of metabolism of dexamethasone but not that of hydrocortisone, the latter is preferred as the adrenal glucocorticoid replacement. Although aminoglutethimide inhibits the synthesis of thyroxine by the thyroid gland, the compensatory increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is frequently of sufficient magnitude to overcome the inhibition of thyroid synthesis due to aminoglutethimide. In spite of an increase in TSH, aminoglutethimide has not been associated with increased prolactin secretion.",

A compensatory increase in secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH by the pituitary occurs (except in patients with ACTH-independent adenomas or carcinomas), necessitating glucocorticoid administration to maintain aminoglutethimide's effect. Aminoglutethimide also inhibits estrogen production from androgens in peripheral tissues by blocking the aromatase enzyme. An additional mechanism in breast cancer, involving enhanced metabolism of estrone sulfate, has also been proposed.",

No alterations in estrogen disposition were seen after short term (6 hours) aminoglutethimide administration. During long term (3 weeks to 8 months) aminoglutethimide treatment mean 4-(14)C-estradiol clearance was not changed. (14)C-Estrone sulfate AUC was reduced by 43% at a low dose of aminoglutethimide (125 mg twice daily) and by 65% at a high dose (250 mg 4 times daily) with hydrocortisone acetate 25 mg twice daily. The estrone sulfate terminal elimination rate constant (lambda z) was concurrently increased (mean of 46 and 79%, respectively, with the 2 dosage regimens). A possible increase in estrone sulfate clearance during long term treatment was tested for by injecting 6,7-(3)H-estrone sulfate. These studies revealed a marked increase (mean 104%) in estrone sulfate clearance in patients receiving the high dose aminoglutethimide schedule. Following injection of 4-(14)C-estradiol plus 6,7-(3)H-estrone sulfate, the fraction of 4-(14)C-estradiol metabolized to estrone sulfate was found to be reduced in all patients (mean 13%). A mean increase of 80% in the urinary excretion of (14)C-estriol was observed after 4-(14)C-estradiol administration.",

This effect seems to be related to an inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (IC50 = 287 uM) rather than blockade of the steroidogenic pathway. This inhibition may explain some of the effects observed in AMG treatment which cannot be ascribed to its direct effect on the cytochrome P450scc complex or aromatase. Taking into account that ODC, the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, is elevated in many types of cancer and that overexpression of this enzyme is associated with cell transformation, one may speculate that the inhibitory action of AMG on protein kinase A represents a positive colateral effect of this drug in cancer therapy.",

Specifically, the drug binds to and inhibits aromatase which is essential for the generation of estrogens from androstenedione and testosterone. A decrease in adrenal secretion of cortisol is followed by an increased secretion of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which will overcome the blockade of adrenocortical steroid synthesis by aminoglutethimide. The compensatory increase in ACTH secretion can be suppressed by the simultaneous administration of hydrocortisone. Since aminoglutethimide increases the rate of metabolism of dexamethasone but not that of hydrocortisone, the latter is preferred as the adrenal glucocorticoid replacement. Although aminoglutethimide inhibits the synthesis of thyroxine by the thyroid gland, the compensatory increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is frequently of sufficient magnitude to overcome the inhibition of thyroid synthesis due to aminoglutethimide. In spite of an increase in TSH, aminoglutethimide has not been associated with increased prolactin secretion.",

The parent compound, glutethimide, is known not to possess this toxic action. The effect of both drugs on bone (femur) marrow cells of mice and rats was examined ... For the in vivo study, glutethimide and aminoglutethimide were given orally (50 mg/kg, daily). After 3 wk of this regimen in mice, there was a significant fall (about 50%) in both white blood cell and platelet counts. This is similar to the blood picture changes induced by aminoglutethimide in women. No hematological effects were observed in rats receiving this drug and glutethimide was without effect in either species.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

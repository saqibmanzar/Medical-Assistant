PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

A clinical picture in which most or all of the following signs or symptoms are present: headache, blurred vision, weakness, tightness in chest, and constricted pupils. 4. Reduction of plasma and RBC cholinesterase activity to a level substantially below 50% of baseline values.

Miosis, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea & frequency of urination ... Nicotinic effects consist of fasciculation of muscles, weakness & paralysis. Central nervous system effects include nervousness, apprehension, ataxia, convulsions & coma. Death is due to resp failure, or sometimes cardiac arrest.

If released to the atmosphere, Menazon should exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere, based on a measured vapor pressure of 9.75X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase Menazon is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 5 hours. Particulate-phase Menazon may be physically removed from the air by both wet and dry deposition. An estimated Koc of 210 suggests that Menazon will have moderate mobility in soil. Volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces should not be significant. This compound is expected to photodegrade on soil surfaces; in sunlight, the main reaction of Menazon is the photooxidation of the PS group to a P:O group, decompoistion half-life of 10.5 hrs. Based on limited data, Menazon is expected to biodegrade in soil and water. A half-life of 23 days was measured for Menazon (at 10 ppm) in a sandy loam soil; Menazon at 250 ppm disappeared at a similar rate. In water, Menazon may adsorb to sediment or particulate matter. This compound is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms may occur based on an estimated BCF value of 30. Occupational exposure may occur through ingestion, inhalation or dermal contact with Menazon. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase Menazon is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 5 hours(3,SRC). Particulate-phase Menazon may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

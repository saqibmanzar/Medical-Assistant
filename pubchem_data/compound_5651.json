PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

Although ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity have been associated with serum or blood vancomycin concentrations of 80-100 ug/mL, these reactions have occurred with concentrations as low as 25 ug/mL. Correlations between serum vancomycin concentrations and ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity still remain to be clarified. Ototoxicity may be transient or permanent. Vancomycin may cause damage to the auditory branch of the eighth cranial nerve and permanent deafness has occurred. Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported rarely. Tinnitus may precede the onset of deafness and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. Deafness may progress despite cessation of vancomycin therapy.  Vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity may be manifested by transient elevations in BUN or serum creatinine concentrations, and the presence of hyaline and granular casts and albumin in the urine. Fatal uremia has occurred. Rarely, the drug has been associated with acute interstitial nephritis.",

The reaction is characterized by a sudden decrease in blood pressure which can be severe and may be accompanied by flushing and/or a maculopapular or erythematous rash on the face, neck, chest, and upper extremities; the latter manifestations may also occur in the absence of hypotension. Wheezing, dyspnea, angioedema, urticaria, and pruritus may also occur. Rarely, cardiac arrest or seizures have occurred.  Vancomycin-induced hypotension appears to result from a negative inotropic and vasodilating action produced in part by a release of histamine, which is directly related to the rate of infusion; the release of histamine also appears to be responsible for the usual manifestations (e.g., erythema, rash, pruritus) of the \"red\" characterization. The reaction usually begins a few minutes after the vancomycin infusion is started, but may not occur until after the infusion is completed, and usually resolves spontaneously over one to several hours after discontinuance of the infusion. If the hypotensive reaction is severe, the use of antihistamines, corticosteroids, or IV fluids may be necessary. The hypotensive reaction is related to the rate of infusion of vancomycin and has been reported most frequently when the drug was administered over a period of 10 minutes or less; however, the reaction may also occur rarely when the drug is infused over a period of 1 hour or longer. To minimize the risk of a hypotensive reaction, vancomycin should be infused over a period of at least 1 hour and the patient's blood pressure should be monitored during the infusion. In patients who have had the reaction, subsequent doses of vancomycin can usually be given without adverse effect if administered at a slow rate (e.g., over several hours). Pretreatment with antihistamines may be of benefit. If attempts to minimize the reaction fail, use of another anti-infective agent may be necessary. The reaction reportedly has occurred in more than 50% of healthy individuals given vancomycin but less frequently when the drug is used therapeutically.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Pseudomembranous colitis may occur during or following discontinuance of anti-infective therapy and ranges in severity from mild to life-threatening. Mild cases of colitis may respond to discontinuance of the drug alone, but diagnosis and management of moderate to severe cases should include appropriate bacteriologic studies and treatment with fluid, electrolyte, and protein supplementation as indicated. If colitis is moderate to severe and is not relieved by discontinuance of the drug, appropriate anti-infective therapy (e.g., metronidazole) should be administered.

He underwent right-shoulder arthroscopy and rotator cuff repair. About three weeks later, he developed pain, swelling and purulent drainage from his right shoulder. Arthroscopic irrigation and drainage was then performed. Intraoperative fluid revealed the presence of Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus spp. and Serratia marcescens. The patient had no known allergies. After reviewing his antimicrobial susceptibility, he was started on vancomycin 1500 mg intravenously every 12 hours (to treat both Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp) and ciprofloxacin 750 mgs by oral induction every 12 hours. The patient's condition improved following antibiotic treatment. He was discharged and allowed to go home on IV vancomycin and oral ciprofloxacin. The patient's platelet count on the day of starting vancomycin therapy was 253 x 10(3)/cu mm. At weeks one, two and three, the counts were 231 x 10(3)/cu mm, 272 x 10(3)/mm and 6 x 103/cu mm, respectively. The patient was admitted for further work-up of the thrombocytopenia. He was later shown to have vancomycin-induced platelet-reactive antibodies, causing significant thrombocytopenia, and then reversal after his vancomycin medication was discontinued. Thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-threatening condition. Vancomycin is often clinically overlooked as a cause of thrombocytopenia, especially in a scenario of sepsis or when there is use of heparin. Simple laboratory testing with drug-dependent antibodies can be helpful in identifying vancomycin as a cause of thrombocytopenia.",

Renal biopsy revealed diffuse and marked interstitial and tubular infiltration by mononuclear cells and eosinophils; acute tubulointerstitial nephritis was diagnosed. The rash progressed to erythema multiforme major after rechallenge with vancomycin in the setting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus peritoneal catheter-related peritonitis and then to fatal toxic epidermal necrolysis in the setting of steroid taper and persistent serum vancomycin levels. This case further implicates vancomycin as a drug that infrequently can cause severe acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and exfoliative dermatitis. When a renally excreted drug such as vancomycin is administered, serum drug levels should be serially monitored and high-dosage steroids be maintained or tapered slowly until serum drug levels become undetectable.",

Renal function was estimated to be 0.27 mL/s based on a serum creatinine of 177 mumol/L. After eight days of therapy, she developed a slightly raised maculopapular rash on her legs and torso, which spread to her abdomen and arms with continued treatment. Vancomycin was discontinued and the patient was treated symptomatically. The rash cleared and did not recur. Rechallenge with vancomycin was not initiated. No other changes in medications or initiations of new medications occurred during the time of treatment with vancomycin. The patient denied any previous immunologically mediated reactions to medications. Maculopapular rash is rare secondary to vancomycin administration, particularly after oral administration. Although clinically significant serum concentrations can be obtained in patients treated with oral vancomycin who have concomitant C. difficile colitis and renal failure, there has not been a clear correlation between these concentrations and any reported adverse sequelae. This case supports the possible occurrence of a true allergic reaction secondary to low-dose oral vancomycin administration.",

Rats were divided into four groups as follows: (i) control (Group 1); (ii) vancomycin-treated (Group 2); (iii) vancomycin plus ISO-treated (Group 3); and (iv) ISO-treated (Group 4). vancomycin (200mg/kg, i.p., twice daily) was administered to Groups 2 and 3 for 7 days. ISO (3mg/kg/day, i.p.) treatment was started 24h before the first administration of vancomycin and continued for 8 days. After the 14th vancomycin injection, the animals were placed in metabolic cages to collect urine samples. All the rats were sacrificed by decapitation, blood samples were taken in tubes and kidneys were excised immediately. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma creatinine, and urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG, a marker of renal tubular injury) were used as markers of vancomycin-induced renal injury in rats. Light microscopy was used to evaluate semi-quantitative analysis of the kidney sections. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR, the product of activated PARP) and PARP-1 expressions in renal tissues were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. vancomycin administration increased BUN levels from 8.07+/-0.75 mg/dL to 53.87+/-10.11 mg/dL. The plasma creatinine levels were 0.8+/-0.04 mg/dL and 3.38+/-0.51 mg/dL for the control and vancomycin-treated groups, respectively. Also, urinary excretion of NAG was increased after vancomycin injection. Besides, there was a significant dilatation of the renal tubules, eosinophilic casts within some tubules, desquamation and vacuolization of renal tubule epithelium, and interstitial tissue inflammation in vancomycin-treated rats. In vancomycin-treated rats, both PAR and PARP-1 expressions were increased in renal tubular cells. ISO treatment attenuated vancomycin-induced renal injury, as indicated by BUN and plasma creatinine levels, urinary NAG excretion, and renal histology. PARP inhibitor treatment also decreased PAR and PARP-1 protein expressions similar to that of controls. Herewith, the overactivation of the PARP pathway may have a role in vancomycin-induced renal impairment and pharmacological inhibition of this pathway might be an effective intervention to prevent vancomycin-induced acute renal injury.",

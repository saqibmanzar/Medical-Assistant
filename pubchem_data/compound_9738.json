When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The aging process is generally accepted as being caused by the dealkylation of the intermediate dialkylphosphorylated enzymes by one of two possible mechanisms. The first involves the hydrolysis of a P-O bond following a nucleophile (base) attack on the phosphorus atom. The second mechanism involves the hydrolysis of an O-C bond by an acid catalysis, resulting in the formation of a carbonium ion as the leaving group. The aging process is believed to fix an extra charge to the protein, causing some perturbation to the active site and thereby preventing dephosphorylation. While the exact nature of this reaction has not been demonstrated for AChE and NTE, evidence from experiments with saligenin cyclic phosphorus esters (derivative of TOTP) and alpha-chymotrypsin points to the possibility of two stabilized forms of \"aged\" enzyme. Both of the reactions utilize the imidazole group of a neighboring histidine. In one reaction, the hydroxylated substituent is released and the phosphorylated enzyme is stabilized by a hydrogen on the imidazole group. In the other reaction, the leaving substituent becomes attached to the imidazole, yielding a N-C hydroxylated derivative of the phosphorylated enzyme.",

Differentiated SY-5Y (SY5Y) cells, a cell line derived from SK-N-SH-human neuroblastoma cells, were incubated with 0 or 5x10(-5) molar (M) mipafox in the presence or absence of 5x10(-3)M aldicarb or 1x10(-7)M verapamil for 2 to 10 minutes. The cultures were assayed for NTE activity. The ability of 25 millimolar isonitroacetophenone (INAP) to reactivate NTE activity was evaluated 2, 5, or 10 minutes after mipafox exposure. A similar experiment was performed in chicken brain homogenates. Mipafox caused a similar time dependent decrease of NTE activity in SY5Y cells and chicken brain homogenates. INAP was capable of reactivating NTE activity; however, the degree of reactivation decreased with increasing time between mipafox and INAP treatment. Aldicarb and verapamil countered the inhibitory effect of mipafox in both SY5Y cells and the brain homogenates. The authors conclude that NTE activity in SY5Y cells and chicken brain homogenates, the accepted model for organophosphate induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN), is inhibited to a similar extent by mipafox. Aldicarb and verapamil exert inhibitory effects on the mipafox induced suppression of NTE activity in both preparations.",

Animals were treated with: 250 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) PMSF; 15mg/kg Mipafax; 250mg/kg PMSF followed 4 hours later by 15mg/kg Mipafax; 15mg/kg Mipafox followed 4 hours later by 250mg/kg PMSF; or 250mg/kg PMSF followed 14 days later by 15mg/kg Mipafax. Animals receiving single doses of either compound were sacrificed 1, 4, 24, 48, or 72 hours after administration and others were sacrificed 14 to 21 days postexposure. Assays were conducted to determine evidence of neuropathy, target enzyme, and damage to cervical cord. Animals receiving PMSF only were incapacitated for 48 hours and then resumed normal activity; no mortality occurred. Mipafox only animals experienced mild tremors and diarrhea; no mortality occurred in this group either. Animals receiving Mipafox 4 hours after PMSF had a 50 percent mortality rate and remained immobile for 48 hours after treatment. Animals receiving PMSF 4 hours after Mipafox had tremors which were eliminated after PMSF treatment which immobilized them for 48 hours; a 25 percent mortality rate occurred. There were no deaths among animals receiving Mipafox 14 days after PMSF, although the animals were similarly incapacitated.",

Caution: rescuers and health care providers must take measures to prevent direct contact with the skin or clothing of contaminated victims, because secondary contamination and serious illness may result, especially with potent pesticides and nerve agents. Maintain an open airway and assist ventilation if necessary. Pay careful attention to respiratory muscle weakness; sudden respiratory arrest may occur. If intubation is required, note potential interactions between neuromuscular blockers and cholinesterase inhibitors. Administer supplemental oxygen. Treat hydrocarbon pneumonitis, seizures, and coma if they occur. Observe asymptomatic patients for at least 8-12 hours to rule out delayed-onset symptoms, especially after extensive skin exposureor ingestion of a highly fat-soluble agent. /Organophosphates and carbamates/",

Give atropine ... repeated frequently as needed. Large cumulative doses of atropine ... may occasionally be required in severe cases. The most clinically important indication for continued atropine administration is persistent wheezing or bronchorrhea. Note: Atropine will reverse muscarinic but not nicotinic effects. Pralidoxime is a specific antidote for organophosphate toxicity, that acts to regenerate the enzyme activity at all affected sites (muscarinic, nicotinic, and probably CNS; however, it does not reactivate plasma cholinesterase). Pralidoxime should be given immediately to reverse muscular weakness and fasciculations... . It is most effective if started within the first 24 hours of the exposure before irreversible phosphorylation of the enzyme, but may still be effective if given late, particularly after exposure to highly lipid soluble compounds.  Pralidoxime is not generally recommended for carbamate intoxication, because in such cases the cholinesterase inhibition is spontaneously reversible and short-lived. However, if the exact agent is not identified and the patient has significant toxicity, pralidoxime should be given empirically. /Organophosphates and carbamates/",

Skin. Remove all contaminated clothing and wash exposed areas with soap and water, including the hair and under the nails. Irrigate exposed eyes with copious tepid water or saline. 2. Ingestion. a. Prehospital. Administer activated charcoal, if available. Do not induce vomiting because of the risk of abrupt onset of toxicity. b.Hospital.  Administer activated charcoal (cathartics are not necessary if the patient already has diarrhea). Perform gastric lavage for large recent ingestions. /Organophosphates and carbamates/",

This study assesses the occurrence of the necrotizing myopathy in rats in relation to the clinical course and the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition after poisoning with organophosphates representative for each of the major types of organophosphate-related neurotoxicity. Marked differences are noted in the duration of cholinergic symptoms and of AChE inhibition after either paraoxon and mipafox, or fenthion poisoning. The necrotizing myopathy begins shortly after the initial decline in AChE activity with all organophosphates studied. Maximal muscle involvement occurs within the first 2 days of the poisoning with all organophosphates studied. The myopathy is not aggravated by a further decline in AChE activity in fenthion poisoning.",

At 7 and 28 days after dosing, in vitro electrophysiological measurements were carried out in the soleus and EDL. Action potentials and end-plate potentials were evoked at 30 Hz and recorded intracellularly from single muscle fibers. The amplitudes, time course, and latencies of these potentials were measured and the variability (jitter) of latencies was calculated. Recordings after mipafox were also made with 3-Hz stimulation. Acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited by mipafox (65% in the soleus; 76% in the EDL) and ecothiopate (59% in the soleus; 42% in the EDL). Mipafox and ecothiopate both increased postjunctional (muscle action potential) jitter in the soleus and EDL at 7 days after dosing. Organophosphates caused an increase in end-plate potential amplitudes in the soleus. Mipafox caused an increase in prejunctional (end-plate potential) jitter at 28 days after dosing in both muscles. A single dose of ecothiopate also caused an increase in prejunctional jitter at 28 days in the soleus. The OP-induced increase in jitter was different at different frequencies of stimulation.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.001 mm Hg at 15 \u00b0C indicates mipafox will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase mipafox will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.2 hours. Mipafox does not absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm and therefore would not be expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, mipafox is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8.8. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.3X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Mipafox is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, mipafox is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Mipafox is reported to hydrolyze slowly; under environmental conditions a half life of 200 days was observed at pH 6. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since currently mipafox is no longer produced or used in the US (May, 2005). In the past, mipafox was applied directly to plants as an insecticide and exposure to this compound was primarily by inhalation and dermal contact. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase mipafox is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.2 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 9.2X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Mipafox does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore would not be expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

Teams administered activity questionnaires regarding pesticide exposure and obtained baseline urine samples to quantify prespray naled metabolite levels. Following the spray event, participants were asked to collect postspray urine specimens within 12 hr of the spray event and at 8-hr intervals for up to 40 hr. Upon completion, a postspray activity questionnaire was administered to study participants. Two hundred five (87%) participants completed the study. The urine analysis showed that although 67% of prespray urine samples had detectable levels of a naled metabolite, the majority of postspray samples were below the limit of detection (< LOD). Only at the \"postspray 6\" time period, which corresponds to a time greater than 5 half-lives (> 40 hr) following exposure, the number of samples with detectable levels exceeded 50%. There was a significant decrease in naled metabolites from prespray to postspray (= .02), perhaps associated with a significant reduction (< or = 0.05) in some participants that may have resulted in pesticide exposure by means other than the mosquito control operations. These data suggest that aerial spraying of naled does not result in increased levels of naled in humans, provided the naled is used according to label instructions.",

Human dietary exposure to these OP pesticides is commonly estimated by measuring the amount of OP metabolites in urine, assuming a stoichiometric relationship between a metabolite and its parent insecticide. Dialkylphosphates (DAPs) are the OP metabolites that are most often used as markers in such biomonitoring studies. However, abiotic hydrolysis, photolysis, and plant metabolism can convert OP chemicals (OP residues) to DAP residues on or in the fruits and vegetables. To evaluate the extent of these conversions, OPs and DAPs were measured in 153 produce samples. These samples from 2 lots were known to contain OP insecticide residues based on routine monitoring by California producers and shippers. A total of 12 OPs were quantified, including mevinphos, naled, acephate, methamidophos, oxidemeton-methyl, azinphos-methyl, dimethoate, malathion, methidathion, phosmet, chlorpyrifos, and diazinon. All OP insecticide residues were below their respective residue tolerances in 2002-2004. A total of 91 of 153 samples (60%) contained more DAP residues than parent OPs. The mean mole fractions [DAPs/(DAPs + OPs)] for the first and second lots of produce were 0.62 and 0.50, respectively, and the corresponding geometric means were 0.55 and 0.34. The corresponding mean mole ratios (DAPs/OP) were 7.1 and 3.4, with geometric means of 2.1 and 0.9. Any preformed DAPs ingested in the diet that are excreted in urine may inflate the estimated absorbed OP insecticide doses in occupational and environmental studies. In subsequent prospective studies, time-dependent production of dimethylphosphate (DMP) and dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP) in strawberries and leaves following malathion sprays occurred concomitant with the disappearance of the parent insecticide and its oxon. DAPs are more persistent in plants and produce at routinely measured levels than their parent OP insecticides.",

Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.",

It is used primarily for controlling adult mosquitoes, but is also used on food and feed crops, and in greenhouses. For mosquito control, naled is applied as an ultra-low volume (ULV) spray. ULV sprayers dispense very fine aerosol droplets containing small quantities of active ingredient insecticide that drift through the air and kill mosquitoes on contact. The amount that reaches the ground is small. For mosquito control, the maximum rate for ground and aerial application is very small.",

The PEL can be given in three ways. [1] Time-weighted average (PEL-TWA): average exposure based on an 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Short-term exposure limit (PEL-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

It is insecticide and acaricide, which is used in cooling tower, paper and pulp mill systems, hide and leather processing and disinfection. It is also used on swimming pool surfaces, household sickroom equipment, food processing plants and equipment, food contact surfaces, hospital rooms, and bathrooms. Naled is also veterinary medication. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Acute symptoms following poisoning by naled include abdominal cramps, emesis, nausea, hypersecretion, cough, and perspiration that disappeared after 2 days, while anxiety, depression, vertigo, and spontaneous horizontal nystagmus persisted for 4 months. Potential symptoms of overexposure are miosis, lacrimation; headache; chest tightness, wheezing and laryngeal spasm; salivation; cyanosis; anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhea; weakness, twitching and paralysis; giddiness, ataxia and convulsions; low blood pressure; cardiac irregularities; irritation of skin and eyes. Dermal exposures to naled caused residual papular dermatitis on the arm, glazing on the skin of the cheek, mild irritation of the neck skin, and a maculopapular eruption of the abdomen that caused a contact sensitization type dermatitis. Dermatitis was also caused by picking flowers sprayed with naled. In another case, contact dermatitis was reported in an aerial applicator exposed to naled. ANIMAL STUDIES: Naled (5 mg/kg) was administered to rats via i.m. injection. Within 15 minutes, cholinergic signs appeared, and plasma and brain cholinesterases were inhibited by 79% and 80%, respectively. Naled caused severe eye and dermal irritation in rabbits and was weakly positive in a skin sensitization test in guinea pigs. In rats given a single oral dose of 25, 100, or 400 mg/kg naled, the 400-mg/kg dose produced mortality and transient decreases in body weight gain. Rats of both sexes given 100 or 400 mg/kg and females given 25 mg/kg showed marked cholinergic effects. No treatment-related neurological effects were observed 7 or 14 days after treatment at any dose level. In a lifetime study, male and female rats were administered doses of 0, 0.2, 2, or 10 mg/kg/day naled via gavage for 2 years. There was a dose-related reduction in plasma, brain, and to a lesser degree, red blood cell (RBC) cholinesterase activity among rats treated with 2 or 10 mg/kg/day.  Slight tremors were noted on isolated occasions after dosing four females given 10 mg/kg/day. The incidence of neoplastic lesions in the treated animals was similar to that of controls. Pregnant rabbits were given doses of 0, 0.2, 2, or 8 mg/kg/day naled by gavage on gestational days 7 through 19. Does were sacrificed on day 29 of gestation. No maternal or developmental toxicity was related to treatment. Naled exhibited no potential to induce mutations in an in vivo mouse spot test that used mice given 3, 20, or 150 mg/kg/day naled by gavage on gestation days 8 to 12. Naled was positive for gene mutation in the S. typhimurium reverse mutation assay but did not induce DNA damage in a rec-type repair test with Proteus mirabilis strains PG713 (rec-, hcr-) and PG273 (wild-type).

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

There is, however, a need to investigate the effects of these pesticides on non-target marine organisms. We tested naled and permethrin, two mosquito adulticides used in the Keys, on a critical early life-history stage of queen conch (Strombus gigas). We conducted 12-hr exposure experiments on competent (i.e., capable of undergoing metamorphosis) queen conch larvae using environmentally relevant pesticide concentrations. We found that there was little to no mortality and that the pesticides did not induce or interfere with metamorphosis. However, after introduction of a natural metamorphic cue (extract of the red alga Laurencia potei), a significantly greater proportion of larvae underwent metamorphosis in the pesticide treatments than in those with the alga alone. In addition to the morphogenetic pathway that induces metamorphosis when stimulated, there thus appears to be a regulatory pathway that enhances the response to metamorphic triggers, as suggested by the increased sensitivity of the queen conch larvae to the algal cue after pesticide exposure (i.e., the pesticides stimulated the regulatory pathway). The regulatory pathway probably plays a role in the identification of high-quality habitat for metamorphosis, as the increased response to the algal cue suggests. Aerial drift and runoff can carry these pesticides into nearshore waters, where they may act as a false signal of favorable conditions and facilitate metamorphosis in suboptimal habitat, thus adversely affecting recruitment in nearshore queen conch populations.",

Remember that atropine can be administered through an endotracheal tube if initial IV access is difficult to obtain. Depending on the severity of poisoning ... /a range of doses/ may be required, or even continuous infusion. The objective of atropine antidotal therapy is to antagonize the effects of excessive concentrations of acetylcholine at end-organs having muscarinic receptors. Atropine does not reactivate the cholinesterase enzyme or accelerate disposition of organophosphate. Recrudescence of poisoning may occur if tissue concentrations of organophosphate remain high when the effect of atropine wears off, and multiple doses will be required. Atropine is effective against muscarinic manifestations, but it is ineffective against nicotinic actions, specifically muscle weakness and twitching, and respiratory depression. Despite the limitations, atropine is often a life-saving agent in organophosphate poisonings. Favorable response to a test dose of atropine can help differentiate poisoning by anticholinesterase agents from other conditions. Note, however, that lack of response with no evidence of atropinization (atropine refractoriness) may also indicate a more severe poisoning. The adjunctive use of nebulized atropine has been reported to improve respiratory distress, decrease bronchial secretions, and increase oxygenation. ... Maintain atropinization by repeated doses based on recurrence of symptoms for 2-12 hours or longer depending on severity of poisoning. Crackles in the lung bases usually indicate inadequate atropinization. Pulmonary improvement may not parallel other signs of atropinization. Continuation of or return of cholinergic signs indicates the need for more atropine. Maintain atropinization with repeated dosing as indicated by clinical status. When symptoms are stable for as much as 6 hours, the dosing may be decreased. Severely poisoned individuals may exhibit remarkable tolerance to atropine; two or more times the dosages suggested above may be needed. The dose of atropine may be increased and the dosing interval decreased as needed to control symptoms. Continuous intravenous infusion of atropine may be necessary when atropine requirements are massive. ... Preservative-free atropine products should be used whenever possible. /Organophosphates/",

Glycopyrolate has been studied as an alternative to atropine and found to have similar outcomes using continuous infusion. Ampules of ... glycopyrolate were added to ... saline and this infusion was titrated to the desired effects of dry mucous membranes, heart rate above 60 beats/min and absent muscle fasciculations. During this study, atropine was used as a bolus for a heart rate less than 60 beats/minute. The other apparent advantage to this regimen was a decreased number of respiratory infections. This may represent an alternative when there is a concern for respiratory infection due to excessive and difficult-to-control secretions, and in the presence of altered level of consciousness where the distinction between atropine toxicity or relapse of organophosphate poisoning is unclear. /Organophosphates/",

Rhinorrhea and a sensation of tightness in the chest are common in inhalation exposures. 4. Blurring or dimness of vision, miosis (with fixed pinpoint pupils), tearing, ciliary muscle spasm, loss of accommodation, and ocular pain. None of these eye effects are diagnostically dependable except in primary ocular exposures. Indeed, mydriasis is sometimes seen, probably due to sympatho-adrenal discharge. /Parathion/",

However, after introduction of a natural metamorphic cue (extract of the red alga Laurencia potei), a significantly greater proportion of larvae underwent metamorphosis in the pesticide treatments than in those with the alga alone. In addition to the morphogenetic pathway that induces metamorphosis when stimulated, there thus appears to be a regulatory pathway that enhances the response to metamorphic triggers, as suggested by the increased sensitivity of the queen conch larvae to the algal cue after pesticide exposure (i.e., the pesticides stimulated the regulatory pathway). The regulatory pathway probably plays a role in the identification of high-quality habitat for metamorphosis, as the increased response to the algal cue suggests. Aerial drift and runoff can carry these pesticides into nearshore waters, where they may act as a false signal of favorable conditions and facilitate metamorphosis in suboptimal habitat, thus adversely affecting recruitment in nearshore queen conch populations.",

Toxicity was assessed at 4 and 21 days for larval and juvenile stages of the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, and the hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, using two pyrethroids (resmethrin and permethrin), an organophosphate (naled), and a juvenile growth hormone mimic (methoprene). Acute toxicity (4-day LC50) values ranged from 1.59 to >10 mg/L. Overall, clams were more susceptible to mosquito control insecticides than oysters. Naled was the most toxic compound in oyster larvae ... . Mortality for both species generally increased with chronic insecticide exposure (21-day LC50 values ranged from 0.60 to 9.49 mg/L). Insecticide exposure also caused sublethal effects, including decreased swimming activity after 4 days in larval oysters (4-day EC50 values of 0.60 to 2.33 mg/L) and decreased growth (shell area and weight) in juvenile clams and oysters after 21 days (detected at concentrations ranging from 0.625 to 10 mg/L).

Responses of terrestrial insects to aerial applications of an organophosphate insecticide, naled, used for mosquito and biting midge control were studied on Parris Island Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, SC. Aerial applications were made with C-130 aircraft at dusk in 2003 and in 2005. In 2003, ...two locations on Parris Island /were sampled/ with Malaise traps before and after spraying, and used Before-After analyses to examine changes in terrestrial insect diversity and abundance. In 2005, ... insects /were sampled/ with yellow pan traps at three locations on Parris Island and at an untreated control site. A Before-After Control-Impact analysis at each location was conducted to compare changes. In 2003, numbers of four of 12 common taxa (Dolichopodidae, Sarcophagidae, Syrphidae, Tachinidae) were lower after sprays. However, there were no significant changes in numbers of common taxa or total numbers in 2005. Shannon diversities (H') were not different in either year indicating that sprays had minimal impact on overall community biodiversity. In contrast, populations of pestiferous biting midges (Culicoides spp.) collected in CDC-style traps were reduced by 94-99% after spraying in both years; mosquito numbers declined by 88.2% in 2003 and 92.5% in 2005, after sprays.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.0X10-4 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates naled will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase naled will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.5 days. Naled has been reported to be degraded by sunlight. If released to soil, naled is expected to have moderate mobility based upon Koc values of 180 and 344. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.5X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Naled and its degradates, dichlorvos and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), are transformed largely by chemical hydrolysis and biodegradation. Under terrestrial, aquatic and forestry field conditions naled dissipated rapidly with half-lives of less than two days for all three cases. Soil studies indicated that naled degraded 2-3 times faster in non-sterile soil versus sterile soil. If released into water, naled is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 32 hours and 16 days, respectively. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate with an estimated half-life of about 1 day. An estimated BCF of 0.4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to naled may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where naled is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to naled via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and dermal contact with this compound. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(5), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 32 hours and 16 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 0.4(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.38(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Naled has a reported hydrolysis rate constant of 0.7 days-1(4) which corresponds to a half-life of about 1 day(SRC).

Vapor-phase naled is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.5 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.3X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The half-lives were 1.4 and 4 hours, respectively, for unsterile and sterile sandy loams. The half-lives for naled ranged from 2.6 to 4.0 hours for other soil types; DDVP was detected in all soil samples(2). The metabolism of 14C-labelled naled in Oakly sandy loam soil under aerobic conditions showed that degradation of naled to 14C-carbon dioxide was rapid with a half-life of 3 days(2). In a cranberry bog, the half-life for the aerobic metabolism of 14C-labelled naled was about 6 hours with most of the naled metabolized to carbon dioxide (71% in 30 days)(2).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that naled is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 32 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 16 days(SRC). Naled's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). However, hydrolysis is expected to be the dominant environmental fate process with a half-life of approximately 1 day(1). Naled is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1). Using a sandy loam farm soil (pH 8.1, organic carbon 0.31%), Naled, uniformly sprayed at a concentration of 250 and 500 g ai/ha, exhibited 85.7 and 85.3% loss, respectively, after one day and was not detected in either case by day 3(3); loss was attributed to volatilization and unstability under sunlight, as well as the alkaline condition of the soil which leads to rapid hydrolysis(3).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Acids and bases initiate polymerization reactions in these materials. Some isocyanates react with water to form amines and liberate carbon dioxide. Polyurethanes are formed by the condensation reaction of diisocyanates with, for example, ethyl glycol.

It is used as a chemical intermediate and as a reagent. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Workers exposed to phenyl isocyanate showed increases in asthmatic symptoms. Exposure to isocyanates is irritating to the skin, mucous membranes, eyes and respiratory tract. Contact dermatitis can result in symptoms such as rash, itching, hives and swelling of the extremities. Phenyl isocyanate is a potent chemical sensitizer. A worker suspected of having isocyanate induced asthma/sensitization will exhibit traditional symptoms of acute airway obstruction coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, tightness of chest and nocturnal awakening. Isocyanate induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis symptoms are flu like which includes shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, fever, chills sweats and malaise and nausea. An irreversible decline in pulmonary function and interstitial fibrosis have also been observed. At high doses isocyanates affect the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and may lead to fatal pulmonary edema or chromic catarrh. ANIMAL STUDIES: The toxic effects of repeated inhalation exposures to phenyl isocyanate vapors in male rats was conducted. Animals experienced decreased weight gain, hypoactivity, hypothermia, and signs of respiratory tract irritation. There was delayed onset of mortality, and changes in organ weights. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated decreased forced expiratory flow volume. Arterial hypoxia was also observed. Pregnant mice were given phenyl isocyanate on select days of gestation. Phenyl isocyanate did demonstrate embryotoxicity. In a micronucleus assay, male and female mice received a single administration of phenyl isocyanate ip; there was an altered ratio between polychromatic and normochromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow, and no clastogenic effect was observed. Phenyl isocyanate did not cause significant induction of chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow of male mice.",

It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

In all cases RAST and/or skin-test investigations revealed the presence of IgE antibodies reacting specifically with HSA conjugated with those isocyanates to which workers were exposed as well as with other isocyanates with which they had not been in contact. By the RAST inhibition technique, moderate to strong mutual cross-reactivities between all tested isocyanate-HSA conjugates--even between aromatic and aliphatic ones--could be demonstrated in tests with five sera. The magnitudes of cross-reactivities differed, however, from one patient to another. One serum contained IgE antibodies that were almost completely specific to TDI-HSA; with this serum only weak cross-reactivities with other isocyanate conjugates could be demonstrated. These results indicate the predominance of closely related antigenic determinants in HSA conjugated with different isocyanates. The common antibody-binding regions are obviously recognized to different extents by antibodies of clinically sensitized workers, indicating individual differences in specificities and avidities of antibody populations. Nearly complete lack of IgE binding of ovalbumin-bound TDI in RAST and RAST inhibition indicates carrier-specific antigenicity of isocyanate-protein conjugates. In addition, since unmodified HSA did not bind IgE, antigenic determinants of the conjugates studied should be predominantly formed by the isocyanate-protein bond regions and concurrently by neighboring amino acid residues of the HSA molecule. /Isocyanates/",

These compounds are potent pulmonary sensitizers which cause bronchospasm, even in patients without prior airway hyperreactivity. Diisocyanate compounds act either as inducers of nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity or as direct pharmacologic agonists. Isocyanates apparently have the potential to sensitize certain segments of the population. Elevated humoral antibodies (ie, specific IgE antibodies to the p-tolyl determinant but not the diisocyanate conjugate) were detected in sensitized workers, but cell-mediated immunity also may produce hypersensitivity reactions. In the absence of renewed exposure, radioallergosorbent titers may not distinguish sensitive from nonsensitized workers. At high doses, toluene diisocyanate may act directly on bronchial mucosa by interfering with cholinergic and adrenergic mechanisms. /Isocyanates/",

The rats were assessed for normal toxicologic parameters and pulmonary function tests blood gas measurements and analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) parameters were utilized shortly after exposures as well as 2 months postexposure. ... Rats exposed to 7 and 10 mg/cu m experienced decreased body weights hypoactivity hypothermia signs of respiratory tract irritation, delayed onset of mortality and changes in organ weights. In addition pulmonary function tests demonstrated decreased forced expiratory flow rates and quasistatic lung compliance. Arterial blood gases showed an arterial hypoxemia and changes consistent with a pronounced venous-admixture-like perfusion suggesting severe mismatch of the ventilation/perfusion relationship. Delayed onset of mortality appeared to be associated with respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia. ... Changes were indicated by increased activities of the aALF parameters, gamma-GPT protein and sialic acid. Histopathological findings provided evidence of increased secretory cell activity and a concentration-dependent increase in goblet cell hyperplasia at concentrations of 4 mg/cu m and above. In rats exposed to 7 mg/cu m further findings consisted of intraluminal inflammation of airways hypertrophia of bronchial smooth muscle epithelial desquamation, and eosinophilia of the airways. A complete regression of morphological lesions was not found in the animals exposed to 4 mg/mL and above at the 2-month postexposure time period. ...

Vapor-phase phenyl isocyanate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days. Phenyl isocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Isocyanates hydrolyze rapidly in water; therefore, soil mobility, biodegradation, and volatilization of phenyl isocyanate in moist soil are not expected to be important environmental fate processes. Phenyl isocyanate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Since isocyanates hydrolyze rapidly in water, hydrolysis half-lives of phenyl isocyanate range from 20 seconds to 75.5 minutes, biodegradation, aquatic bioconcentration, volatilization, and adsorption to sediment of phenyl isocyanate are not expected to be important environmental fate processes. Occupational exposure to phenyl isocyanate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where phenyl isocyanate is produced or used. Phenyl isocyanate has been detected in polyurethane foundry mold binder, in iron and steel foundry, and in aluminum foundry atmospheres. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

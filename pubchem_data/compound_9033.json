If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

Ethyleneimine gives inadequate warning when over-exposure is by inhalation or skin absorption. It is a severe blistering agent, causing third degree chemical burns of the skin. Also, it has a corrosive effect on mucous membranes and may cause scarring of the esophagus. It is corrosive to eye tissue and may cause permanent corneal opacity and conjunctival scarring. Severe exposure may result in overwhelming pulmonary edema. Renal damage has been described. Hemorrhagic congestion of all internal organs has been observed. (EPA, 1998)",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 213 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyleneimine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyleneimine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.6 days. Ethyleneimine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethyleneimine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2. However, the pKa of ethyleneimine is 8.04, indicating that this compound will partially exist as a cation in the environment and cations generally do adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyleneimine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, ethyleneimine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. However volatilization will be attenuated due to its cationic state under environmental conditions. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Attenuation is pH dependent with little volatilization expected under acidic conditions. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 17 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A hydrolysis half-life of 154 days suggests that hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process. Occupational exposure to ethyleneimine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyleneimine is produced or used. (SRC)",

However volatilization will be attenuated as ethyleneimine exits as a cation (pKa = 8.04(4)) under environmental conditions and will therefore absorb to solids and sediment. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 213 mm Hg(5), and water solubility(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 17 days, respectively(SRC). Attenuation is pH dependent with little volatilization expected under acidic conditions(6). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

Vapor-phase ethyleneimine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.6 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.10X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

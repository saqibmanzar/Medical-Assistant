PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The Committee at its present meeting reviewed two new residue depletion studies and previously-assessed residue depletion studies in cattle, in particular those using a combination of intraruminal controlled-release capsule and administration via feed. Based on the controlled-release capsule alone residue study, the Committee revised the MRL for cattle liver to be 100 \u03bcg/kg, as monensin A. Combined use of the capsule and feed premix in cattle at the highest reported dose will likely result in liver residues exceeding the revised MRL. Without any additional data, the Committee was unable to revise the current MRLs for goats & sheep. Using the revised MRL for cattle, the recalculated TMDI was 481 \u03bcg/p/d (80% of the ADI).",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The drug was given by intracrop and intravenous routes in a single dose of 40 mg/kg body weight. Following intravenous injection the kinetic disposition of monensin followed a two compartments open model with absorption half life of 0.59 hr, volume of distribution of 4.11 l/kg and total body clearance of 28.36 ml/kg/min. The highest serum concentrations of monensin were reached 0.5 hr after intracrop dosage with an absorption half-life of 0.27 hr and an elimination half life of 2.11 hr. The systemic bioavailability was 65.1% after intracrop administration. Serum protein-binding tendency of monensin calculated in vitro was 22.8%. Monensin concentrations in the serum and tissues of chickens after a single intracrop dose of pure monensin (40 mg/kg body weight) were higher than those after feeding a supplemented monensin premix (120 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. Monensin residues were detected in tested body tissues, collected 2, 4, 6 and 8 hr after oral administration. The highest concentration was found in the liver. In addition, monensin residues were detected only in liver, kidney and fat 24 hr after the last oral dose. No monensin residues could be detected in tissues after 48 hr, except in liver which cleared completely by 72 hr.",

As assayed by the measurement of the amount of the released formaldehyde, the rate of monensin O-demethylation was nearly of the same order of magnitude in all species, but total monensin metabolism, which was estimated by measuring the rate of substrate disappearance by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, was highest in cattle, intermediate in rats, chicks and pigs, and lowest in horses. When expressed as turnover number (nmol of metabolized monensin/min nmol cytochrome P450-1), the catalytic efficiency (chick >> cattle >> pig approximately rat > horse) was found to correlate inversely with the well known interspecies differences in the susceptibility to the toxic effects of the ionophore, which is characterized by an oral LD50 of 2-3 mg/kg bodyweight (bw) in horses, 50-80 mg/kg bw in cattle and 200 mg/kg bw in chicks. Chick and cattle microsomes also displayed both the highest catalytic efficiency toward two P450 3A dependent substrates (erythromycin and triacetyloleandomycin) and the highest immunodetectable levels of proteins cross-reacting with anti rat P450 3A1/2. ...",

The oxidative metabolism of monensin appears to occur at least in part by CYP3A, since treatment of rat hepatic microsomes with chemical inducers of CYP3A significantly increased monensin O-demethylation. It has been speculated that competition between monensin and other CYP3A substrates may explain accidental poisonings that have occurred in several domestic species following coadministration of monensin and other chemotherapeutic agents, since monensin metabolism is significantly decreased in the presence of other CYP3A substrates in rats.",

In most species (chickens, rats, dogs, turkeys and pigs), less than 10% of monensin is excreted as the parent compound, whereas a study in calves indicated that 50-68% of the (14)C identified in the feces was unmetabolized monensin. This difference in amount of metabolized monensin may have been a result of differences in absorption of the molecule in different species. Total microsomal monensin metabolism, estimated by measuring the rate of substrate disappearance by a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analytical method, is highest in cattle, intermediate in rats, chickens and pigs, and lowest in horses. The pattern of metabolites is qualitatively similar between laboratory and non-laboratory animal species, although quantitative differences exist. No single metabolite dominates the metabolic profile.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

However, aberrant activation of the pathway is implicated in a number of human disorders, including cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, breast, liver, melanoma, and hematologic malignancies. In this study, we identified monensin, a polyether ionophore antibiotic, as a potent inhibitor of Wnt signaling. The inhibitory effect of monensin on the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade was observed in mammalian cells stimulated with Wnt ligands, glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitors, and in cells transfected with beta-catenin expression constructs. Furthermore, monensin suppressed the Wnt-dependent tail fin regeneration in zebrafish and Wnt- or beta-catenin-induced formation of secondary body axis in Xenopus embryos. In Wnt3a-activated HEK293 cells, monensin blocked the phoshorylation of Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 and promoted its degradation. In human colorectal carcinoma cells displaying deregulated Wnt signaling, monensin reduced the intracellular levels of beta-catenin. The reduction attenuated the expression of Wnt signaling target genes such as cyclin D1 and SP5 and decreased the cell proliferation rate. In multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice, daily administration of monensin suppressed progression of the intestinal tumors without any sign of toxicity on normal mucosa. Our data suggest monensin as a prospective anticancer drug for therapy of neoplasia with deregulated Wnt signaling.",

Under the same conditions, monensin decreased the insulin-stimulated (1 mU/mL) 2-deoxyglucose uptake by 29 & 37% respectively. The monensin-induced augmentation of basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake was inhibited 92% by cytochalasin B suggesting that the uptake is mediated by glucose transporters. Monensin did not incr the cellular accumulation of L-glucose in muscle indicating that it does not affect the cell membrane integrity. Neither the stimulatory effect of monensin on basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake nor the opposite, inhibitory action of monensin on the insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake were influenced by the removal of Ca2+ from the medium or by dantrolene, an inhibitor of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that the actions of monensin are not mediated by calcium. Monensin had no effect on muscle ATP concn. The monensin-induced augmentation of basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake was neither associated with stimulation of muscle phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity nor inhibited by wortmannin, demonstrating that the incr in basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake is not mediated by activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The inhibition of insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake by monensin was associated with a 31% decr in the abundance of insulin receptors in muscles, a 64% decr in the insulin-induced autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta-subunit, & a 44% reduction of the insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. Addition of monensin into the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase reaction had no effect on the activity of the enzyme, demonstrating that the inhibition in monensin-treated muscles is indirect & occurs upstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. It is concluded that monensin has a dual effect on 2-deoxyglucose uptake by skeletal muscle: it stimulates basal uptake but inhibits the insulin-stimulated uptake. The primary cause of the latter, inhibitory effect of monensin is at the level of the insulin receptor.",

The essence of this paper is to demonstrate that one single method can serve very well for two entirely different purposes, i.e., screening & confirmation. Highly reliable confirmation of the identity at low concentrations was demonstrated when residues of narasin were detected & quantified (0.2 to 11 ng g(-1)) in 50% of the Swedish eggs analysed in 1999. Four daughter ions were detected with ion ratios meeting suggested confirmation criteria for the European Union, even at 0.2 ng g(-1). The method was found to be highly cost-effective since both screening & confirmation of 98 liver samples were performed in only two analytical runs (the Swedish national surveillance scheme of 1999, report level 5 ng g(-1)). The high performance of the method for the different applications was possible due to a combination of the power of ES-LC-MS-MS, a procedure involving screening of pooled samples, & method optimisation of the work-up (automated solid phase extraction), LC & MS parameters. Validation data for narasin (0.5 to 20 ng g(-1)) in eggs are presented (accuracy 94 to 108%, relative standard deviation 4 to 10%, limit of detection 0.026 ng g(-1)). The time for an LC-MS-MS run was 4 min, corresponding to 48 s per sample in a pool.",

Monensin is a mixture of four analogues, A, B, C and D, with monensin A being the major component (98%). Depending on the method of purification, monensin can exist in mycelial, crystalline and recrystallized forms.  It is used for the treatment of coccidiosis in poultry (chickens, turkeys and quail) and ruminants (cattle, sheep and goats). Monensin is also used to control ketosis and bloat in cattle and as a growth promoter feed additive in cattle and sheep. Monensin is mainly effective against Gram-positive bacteria. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: 17 year-old boy who developed myoglobinuria, renal failure and death 11 days after ingesting sodium monensin. In another case, a patient took a dose of monensin three times higher than a dose considered lethal for cattle and developed a clinical picture similar to that reported in veterinary medicine. There was an early and extremely severe rhabdomyolysis followed by acute renal failure, heart failure, and death. The main changes observed at autopsy were extensive skeletal muscle necrosis, complement deposition at the myocardial level, pulmonary edema, & acute tubular damage. ANIMAL STUDIES: Acute toxicity was examined in mature rhesus monkeys. Pairs of monkeys were exposed to a single dose of 20, 40 or 60 mg monensin/kg bw by gavage and were monitored for 7 days. All animals survived and developed diarrhea within 24 hr after dosing. Adult goats were administered sodium monensin, 13.5 mg kg (-1), daily for five consecutive days via gastric gavage. Monensin exposure caused diarrhea, tachycardia and reduction in ruminal movements and body temperature. In an inhalational exposure study, rats were exposed to either normal air or air containing particulate mycelial monensin sodium at a mean concentration of 79 mg/cu m for 2 weeks (1 hr/day, 5 days/week). Nine of 10 treated females became anorexic and lost weight during the 2nd week of the study. Slight focal myositis of the skeletal muscle was seen in two males and two females but none of the controls. Multifocal myocardial changes were observed in male rats treated with monensin. In a subchronic study, male and female mice were fed diets containing 0, 37.5, 75, 150 or 300 mg mycelial monensin sodium/kg for 3 months. A dose-dependent decrease in body weight gain occurred in all dose groups. At the end of the study, the decrease ranged from 27% and 21% in the lowest dose group in females and males, respectively, to 99% in the highest dose group in both sexes. In a chronic toxicity study, male and female rats were maintained on a diet containing 25, 56 or 125 mg crystalline monensin sodium/kg, whereas control rats received a normal diet for 2 years. Body weight and weight gain were significantly decreased in animals receiving 125 mg monensin/kg in their diet and were transiently decreased during the first 4 months in rats in the middle dose group. Benign and malignant neoplasms were observed in treated and untreated animals, with no association between monensin administration and neoplasm type or severity. Monensin is toxic in horses. Clinical signs were tachycardia and cardiac arrythmia, groaning, incoordination, sudoresis, recumbency, and paddling movements with the limbs before death. Main necropsy findings were in the skeletal muscles and myocardium. The effects of exposure to monensin during development were studied in rats. Groups of female rats received monensin at concentrations of 0, 100 or 300 mg/kg until premating weights achieved 185 g and during pregnancy and lactation. Female body weight was significantly decreased in the highest dose group after 8 days of treatment. The body weights of male and female pups in the highest dose group were reduced from postnatal day 10 until postnatal day 21. Male offspring in the low dose group showed body weight reduction only on postnatal day 21. No external signs of malformation were detected in the pups. A study was also undertaken to explore the effects of monensin, a potent Golgi disturbing agent on male fertility. Male rats were administered monensin at the dose levels of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg b wt. Animals were sacrificed after 67 days of the treatment. The findings from electron microscopy such as membrane disruption, swelling and disintegration of Golgi apparatus strongly suggest the interference of monensin with the functioning of Golgi apparatus in the spermatogenic cells. Data from the sperm number and motility as well as the fertility studies and the resulted litter size further points towards the antifertility effects of monensin in male rats. Genotoxicity tests were negative.",

The effect of the GPs in the monensin-unsupplemented diets fed up to 49 d of age on performance & carcase was also determined. Monensin significantly (P < 0.05) depressed food intake, weight gain & food efficiency from 7 to 28 d of age. None of the GPs was able to counteract these effects. However, AVO slightly ameliorated them. AVO also significantly increased food intake & improved gain & food efficiency during 7 to 28, but not 28 to 49 or 7 to 49 d of age. VIR & BAC did not affect performance in either age period. Monensin did not affect the utilisation of dietary dry matter, fat or energy, but it significantly decreased nitrogen utilisation. AVO improved nitrogen & fat utilisation & increased dietary AME(n) content. AME(n) was also increased by VIR. The utilisation of these nutrients was not affected by the interactions between monensin & the GPs. Monensin did not affect yield of the DEC or the relative liver size at 31 d of age. It significantly increased the relative length of the small intestine (SI) & decreased its specific weight. AVO significantly increased yield at 31, but not at 53 d of age. BAC & VIR did not affect this variable. AVO & VIR, but not BAC, at both age periods reduced, at times significantly, the size, length & specific weight of the SI. Our conclusions: BAC, VIR & AVO do not counteract the toxic effect of monensin. The effect of GPs in improving performance decreases & even disappears with age, while their effect in reducing the size of the SI is still evident in 49 day old birds.",

In Phase II, the two compounds were administered simultaneously to study the toxic interaction (monensin 10 mg/kg & tiamulin 40 mg/kg bw, respectively). Monensin proved to be toxic to rats at doses of 30 & 50 mg/kg. Tiamulin was well tolerated up to the dose of 200 mg/kg. After combined administration, signs of toxicity were seen (including lethality in females). Monensin caused a dose-dependent cardiotoxic effect & vacuolar degeneration of the skeletal muscles in the animals given 50 mg/kg. Both compounds exerted a toxic effect on the liver in high doses. After simultaneous administration of the two compounds, there was a mild effect on the liver (females only), hydropic degeneration of the myocardium & vacuolar degeneration of the skeletal muscles. The alteration seen in the skeletal muscles was more marked than that seen after the administration of 50 mg/kg monensin alone.",

The effect of these agents on the viability of the cells was related to changes in ATP content and the deenergization of the mitochondria. The ATP content was reduced by over 90% by each inhibitor. All of the agents except oligomycin killed the cells within 4 h. With the exception of oligomycin, the mitochondrial membrane potential as measured by the distribution of [3H]triphenylmethylphosphonium collapsed with each of the agents. Monensin, a H+/Na+ ionophore, potentiated the toxicity of cyanide and CCCP, whereas the toxicity of valinomycin was reduced. The effect of cyanide and monesin on the cytoplasmic pH of cultured hepatocytes was measured with the fluorescent probe, 2',7'-biscarboxyethyl-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. Cyanide promptly acidified the cytosol, and the addition of 10 microM monensin caused a rapid alkalinization of the cytosol. A reduction of pH of the culture medium from 7.4 to 6.6 and 6.0 prevented the cell killing both by cyanide alone and by cyanide in the presence of monensin. However, neither monensin nor extracellular acidosis had any effect on the loss of mitochondrial energization in the presence of cyanide. It is concluded that ATP depletion per se is insufficient to explain the cell killing with cyanide, CCCP, and valinomycin. Rather, cell killing is better correlated with a loss of mitochondrial energization. With cyanide an intracellular acidosis interferes with the mechanism that couples collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential to lethal cell injury.",

Anorexia and/or diarrhea occurred within 24 hr after monensin administration in all 6 horses. Cardiac disease and dysfunction were evaluated by both elevations in heart rate, echocardiography, and an increase in serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), occurred in 4 horses. The development and severity of cardiac disease was likely affected by the monensin dose, vehicle (water or corn oil) mixed with monensin, and/or whether the monensin was administered to fed or fasted horses. Initial increases in cTnI concentrations occurred between 24 and 72 hr after monensin administration. The 2 horses with the highest cTnI concentrations died or were euthanized within 5 days after monensin administration and had severe cardiac disease. One horse had increased cTnI concentrations from day 2 to day 16, but no apparent change in ventricular contractile function was evident on echocardiography. The fourth diseased horse did not return to cTnI reference intervals until day 27 after monensin administration, and the ventricular function was still abnormal just before euthanasia 9 months later. Cardiac troponin I measurements could be useful in managing farm outbreaks of accidental monensin feeding by the early identification of horses with cardiac disease.",

Pharmaceuticals were added at concentrations of 0.1 mg/kg soil or 10 mg/kg soil. The authors collected soil samples in 2013, before and after the fourth annual application of pharmaceuticals. In addition, a 30-day laboratory experiment was undertaken with the same soil and same pharmaceuticals, but at concentrations of 100 mg/kg soil. The impact of the pharmaceuticals on nitrification rates, on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) was assessed. None of the pharmaceuticals at 0.1 mg/kg had any effect on nitrification. Referenced to control soil, nitrification was accelerated in soil exposed to 100 mg/kg zinc bacitracin or 10 mg/kg of the pharmaceutical mixture, but none of the treatments inhibited nitrification. Neither AOB abundance nor AOA abundance was affected by the pharmaceuticals at 0.1 mg/kg. At 10 mg/kg, monensin, zinc bacitracin, and a mixture of all 3 pharmaceuticals suppressed the abundance of AOB, and zinc bacitracin and the mixture increased AOA abundance. The decrease in AOB abundance and increase in AOA abundance when exposed to 10 mg/kg soil suggests that AOB are more sensitive to these chemicals and that AOA populations can expand to occupy the partially vacated niche.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.2X10-23 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates monensin will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase monensin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Monensin did not absorb light at environmentally relevant wavelengths and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, monensin is expected to have moderate to no mobility based upon reported Koc values of 125-5700. The estimated pKa of monensin is 4.2, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon the estimated pKa. Monensin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Monensin had degradation half-lives of 3.8 and 3.3 days in unamended and manure amended soil, respectively, indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, monensin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the reported Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated pKa. An estimated BCF of 10 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Monensin was stable to hydrolysis at pH 7 and 9, but had a hydrolysis half-life of 13 days at pH 4 and 25 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to monensin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where monensin is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to monensin via dermal contact with contaminated soil or water. Use data indicate that the general population could be exposed to monensin via ingestion of meat or eggs from animals fed monensin supplement. (SRC)",

Volatilization of monensin from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process given the estimated pKa(3). Monensin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 5.2X10-23 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5). Monensin was degraded 40-75% in soil in 7 day aerobic studies, approximately 20% was attributed to abiotic reactions and the remaining portion was considered biodegradation(6). Other degradation studies indicated half-lives of of 3.8 and 3.3 days in unamended and manure amended soil, respectively(7).",

An estimated pKa of 4.2(3) indicates monensin will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). Monensin was stable to hydrolysis at pH 7 and 9, but had a hydrolysis half-life of 13 days at pH 4 and 25 \u00b0C(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 10(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 5.43(6) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation data in water were not available, however soil degradation studies, monensin degraded 40-75% in 7 days, approximately 20% was attributed to abiotic reactions and the remaining portion was considered biodegradation(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It is withdrawn in the United Kingdom due to risk of psychiatric adverse drug reactions. This drug continues to be available in the U.S. Internationally, triazolam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to bezodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

While the risk and severity of withdrawal manifestations are increased as the duration and dose increase, such manifestations are increased as the duration and dose increase, such manifestations can occur at usual doses given for relatively short periods (e.g., 1-2 weeks) and occasionally between nightly doses. Therefore, if the drug is to be discontinued in any patient receiving more than the lowest dose for longer than a few weeks, it si recommended that dosage be tapered gradually. Gradual tapering is particularly important in patients with a seizure history. There also is evidence that abrupt discontinuance of triazolam after relatively short periods of therapy (e.g., 1 week) can result in rebound insomnia, which generally persists for one to two nights. Therefore, some clinicians suggest that gradual dosage reduction (e.g., over several nights) also be considered when discontinuing short-term triazolam therapy, since the development of rebound insomnia can perpetuate continued use of hypnotics in patients with insomnia.",

Some countries temporarily withdrew triazolam from the market because of concerns about adverse reactions, mostly psychological, associated with higher dose ranges. Its use at lower doses with appropriate care and labeling has been reaffirmed by the FDA and most other countries. Triazolam has a shorter half-life than chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam, and prazepam and does not generate active metabolites.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

These algorithms are based on the pattern of benzophenone derivatives of benzodiazepines obtained by GC-MS with use of a modified specific ion selection mode. Benzophenone derivatives were produced by acid hydrolysis of urine samples containing benzodiazepines and (or) their metabolites. ... Mass spectra of the newer benzodiazepines alprazolam, midazolam, and triazolam /are presented/ and ... the detection limit (0.2 mg/L) for these drugs as measured with the enzyme-multiplied immunoassay d.a.u benzodiazepine assay and the ETS instrument /was determined. It was concluded that/ these algorithms are useful mostly in forensic toxicology in which unequivocal identification of benzodiazepines is the desired goal.",

Identical fused-silica SE-54 columns were inserted in a common split-splitless injector and connected to nitrogen phosphorus and ECD. By combining these specific and sensitive detectors considerable and accurate chromatography information was obtained in a single run. The drugs were extracted from 1 ml of buffered plasma or blood with n-hexane dichloromethane (70:30) and analyzed without derivatization. Flurazepam was used as internal std. The method was reproducible enough to permit reliable quantitation of plasma diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, temazepam, midazolam, alprazolam, clobazam, norclobazam, adinazolam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, triazolam, nitrazepam and clonazepam within 12 min.",

Experimental animal studies did not find a higher chance for birth defects with exposure to triazolam. One report on 97 people who used triazolam in pregnancy did not suggest an increased chance of birth defects. A report looking at people who filled at least 1 triazolam prescription found no link between triazolam and an increased chance for birth defects. Prescription based studies can not tell us if the person who filled the prescription actually took the medication during their pregnancy.",

Since it reverses only benzodiazepine-induced CNS depression, it is diagnostic as well as therapeutic. The antagonist can confirm a suspected diagnosis of benzodiazepine overdose or exclude benzodiazepine intoxication as a cause of CNS depression in an undiagnosed patient. In coma, secondary to multiple drug overdose, removing the benzodiazepine component may avoid the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Flumazenil may be useful postoperatively to reverse the effects of preoperative sedation, or to reverse an inadvertent overdose when benzodiazepines are used for conscious sedation in outpatients. /Benzodiazepines/",

However, because benzodiazepine overdose by itself is rarely fatal, the role of flumazenil in routine management has yet to be established. It is administered intravenously with a starting dose of 0.1-0.2 mg, repeated as needed up to a maximum of 3 mg. It has some important potential drawbacks: 1. It may induce seizures in patients with tricyclic antidepressant overdose. 2. It may induce acute withdrawal, including seizures and autonomic instability, in patients who are addicted to benzodiazepines. 3. Resedation is common when the drug wears off after 1-2 hours, and repeated dosing or a continuous infusion is often required /Benzodiazepines/.",

On occasion, anticholinergic symptoms such as dry mouth, tachycardia, dilated pupils, and absent bowel sounds may be seen. Patients who have been receiving or ingesting benzodiazepines on a chronic basis (40 to 80 mg or more per day for one to two months or more) may exhibit mild to moderate symptoms of withdrawal, with severe withdrawal symptoms seen in patients taking the drug for many months to years. Symptoms may include jitteriness, nervousness, anxiety, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and seizures. Patients exhibiting withdrawal symptoms should be restarted on benzodiazepine and slowly withdrawn over a period of several months ... . In most cases, ingestion of a benzodiazepine agent of up to 1.5 g results in only minor toxicity, ie, CNS depression.

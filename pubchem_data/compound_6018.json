It is a hexahydro-dimethoxybenzoquinolizine derivative and a deuterated [DB04844]. The presence of deuterium in deutetrabenazine increases the half-lives of the active metabolite and prolongs their pharmacological activity by attenuating CYP2D6 metabolism of the compound. This allows less frequent dosing and a lower daily dose with improvement in tolerability. Decreased plasma fluctuations of deutetrabenazine due to attenuated metabolism may explain a lower incidence of adverse reactions associated with deutetrabenazine. Deutetrabenazine is a racemic mixture containing  RR-Deutetrabenazine and SS-Deutetrabenazine.   Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and neuropsychiatric disturbances that interfere with daily functioning and significantly reduce the quality of life. The most prominent physical symptom of HD that may increase the risk of injury is chorea, which is an involuntary, sudden movement that can affect any muscle and flow randomly across body regions. Psychomotor symptoms of HD, such as chorea, are related to hyperactive dopaminergic neurotransmission. Deutetrabenazine depletes the levels of presynaptic dopamine by blocking VMAT2, which is responsible for the uptake of dopamine into synaptic vesicles in monoaminergic neurons and exocytotic release. As with other agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, deutetrabenazine is a drug to alleviate the motor symptoms of HD and is not proposed to halt the progression of the disease. In clinical trials of patients with HD, 12 weeks of treatment of deutetrabenazine resulted in overall improvement in mean total maximal chorea scores and motor signs than placebo. It was approved by FDA in April 2017 and is marketed under the trade name Austedo as oral tablets.",

As of 2019, three VMAT2 inhibitors have become available in the United States for management of dyskinesia syndromes, each with a somewhat different spectrum of approved indications: tetrabenazine (Xenazine and generics: 2008), deutetrabenazine (Austedo: 2017) and valbenazine (Ingressa: 2017). The VMAT2 inihibitors have not been associated with serum enzyme elevations during therapy or linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury, but they have had limited general clinical use.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

After basal evaluation, the patients received, through a slow titration, oral TBZ twice a day for six weeks (up to 50 mg daily) before being re-assessed after a challenge with levodopa. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) dyskinesia score (items 32 to 34). TBZ was well tolerated. A clear treatment effect on LIDs emerged (up to 45%, p<0.05). In two patients a little worsening of motor performance necessitated an increase of the antiparkinsonian therapy, which did not worsen peak-dose LIDs. The patients experienced a clear benefit in terms of their quality of life. In this open-label pilot study, orally administered TBZ resulted in objective and subjective improvements in LIDs. Larger pharmacological studies are in progress.",

This study explored the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of deutetrabenazine in adolescents with moderate-to-severe tics associated with Tourette syndrome (TS). In this open-label study of 12-18-year-old patients with TS-related tics, deutetrabenazine was titrated up to 36 mg/day over 6 weeks to adequately suppress tics without bothersome adverse effects (AEs), followed by maintenance at optimal dose for 2 weeks. An independent blinded rater assessed tic severity using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), which was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included the TS Clinical Global Impression (TS-CGI) and TS Patient Global Impression of Change (TS-PGIC). Twenty-three enrolled patients received deutetrabenazine and had at least 1 post-baseline YGTSS assessment. The mean (SD [standard deviation]) baseline YGTSS Total Tic Severity Score (TTS) was 31.6 (7.9) and had decreased by 11.6 (8.2) points at week 8, a 37.6% reduction in tic severity (p<0.0001). The TS-CGI score improved by 1.2 (0.81) points (p<0.0001) and the TS-PGIC results at week 8 indicated that 76% of patients were much improved or very much improved compared with baseline. The mean (SD) daily deutetrabenazine dose at week 8 was 32.1 (6.6) mg (range 18-36 mg). One week after withdrawal of deutetrabenazine, the TTS scores increased by 5.6 (8.4) points, providing confirmation of the drug effect. No serious or severe adverse events were reported. The results of this open-label 8-week study suggest that deutetrabenazine is safe and associated with improvement in tic severity in adolescents with TS and troublesome tics.",

Xenazine can increase the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior (suicidality) in patients with Huntington's disease. Anyone considering the use of Xenazine must balance the risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for control of chorea. Close observation of patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior should accompany therapy. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risk of depression and suicidality and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician.  Particular caution should be exercised in treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation, which are increased in frequency in Huntington's disease. Xenazine is contraindicated in patients who are actively suicidal, and in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression.",

Austedo can increase the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior (suicidality) in patients with Huntington's disease. Anyone considering the use of Austedo must balance the risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for treatment of chorea. Closely monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risk of depression and suicidality and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician.  Particular caution should be exercised in treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation, which are increased in frequency in Huntington's disease. Austedo is contraindicated in patients who are suicidal, and in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression.",

Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, including deutetrabenazine, may cause a worsening in mood, cognition, rigidity, and functional capacity. Prescribers should periodically reevaluate the need for deutetrabenazine in their patients by assessing the effect on chorea and possible adverse effects, including sedation/somnolence, depression and suicidality, parkinsonism, akathisia, restlessness, and cognitive decline. It may be difficult to distinguish between adverse reactions and progression of the underlying disease; decreasing the dose or stopping the drug may help the clinician to distinguish between the two possibilities. In some patients, the underlying chorea itself may improve over time, decreasing the need for deutetrabenazine.",

In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Huntington's disease patients, akathisia, agitation, or restlessness was reported by 4% of patients treated with deutetrabenazine, compared to 2% of patients on placebo; in patients with tardive dyskinesia, 2% of patients treated with deutetrabenazine and 1% of patients on placebo experienced these events. Patients receiving deutetrabenazine should be monitored for signs and symptoms of restlessness and agitation, as these may be indicators of developing akathisia. If a patient develops akathisia during treatment with deutetrabenazine, the deutetrabenazine dose should be reduced; some patients may require discontinuation of therapy.",

While NMS has not been observed in patients receiving deutetrabenazine, it has been observed in patients receiving tetrabenazine (a closely related VMAT2 inhibitor). Clinicians should be alerted to the signs and symptoms associated with NMS. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnosis of NMS can be complicated; other serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal disorders can present with similar signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology. /Tetrabenazine/",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of a-HTBZ and b-HTBZ are reached within 1 to 1 1/2 hours post-dosing. a-HTBZ is subsequently metabolized to a minor metabolite, 9-desmethyl-a-DHTBZ. b-HTBZ is subsequently metabolized to another major circulating metabolite, 9-desmethyl-b-DHTBZ, for which Cmax is reached approximately 2 hours post-dosing.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Deutetrabenazine reversibly depletes the levels of monoamines, such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine, from nerve terminals via its active metabolites. The major circulating metabolites are \u03b1-dihydrotetrabenazine [HTBZ] and \u03b2-HTBZ that act as reversible inhibitors of VMAT2. Inhibition of VMAT2 results in decreased uptake of monoamines into synaptic terminal and depletion of monoamine stores from nerve terminals.   Deutetrabenazine contains the molecule deuterium, which is a naturally-occurring, nontoxic hydrogen isotope but with an increased mass relative to hydrogen. Placed at key positions, deuterium forms a stronger hydrogen bond with carbon that requires more energy for cleavage, thus attenuating CYP2D6-mediated metabolism without having any effect on the therapeutic target.",

It is used as adrenergic uptake inhibitor for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease. Pharmacology studies demonstrate that betrabenzaine reversibly inhibits the activity of vesicular monoamine transporter 2, resulting in depletion of central dopamine. HUMAN STUDIES: Adverse effects are dose and age related and include depression, fatigue, parkinsonism, and somnolence. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal syndrome, has been reported in patients receiving tetrabenazine and other drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission. Three episodes of overdose occurred in the open-label trials performed in support of registration. Eight cases of overdose have been reported in the literature. The dose of the drug in these patients ranged from 100 mg to 1 g. Adverse reactions associated with overdose include acute dystonia, oculogyric crisis, nausea and vomiting, sweating, sedation, hypotension, confusion, diarrhea, hallucinations, rubor, and tremor. Completed suicide,  attempted suicide, and 6 cases of suicidal ideation were reported in 187 tetrabenazine recipients. Major human metabolite 9-Desmethyl-beta-dihydrotetrabenazine was not clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. ANIMAL STUDIES: No increase in tumors was observed in transgenic mice treated orally with a major human metabolite, 9-desmethyl-beta-dihydrotetrabenazine (20, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day), for 26 weeks. Oral administration of tetrabenazine (5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day) to female rats prior to and throughout mating, and continuing through day 7 of gestation resulted in disrupted estrous cyclicity at doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day. No effects on mating and fertility indices or sperm parameters (motility, count, density) were observed when male rats were treated orally with tetrabenazine (5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day. However, because rats dosed with tetrabenazine do not produce 9-desmethyl-beta-dihydrotetrabenazine, a major human metabolite, this study may not have adequately assessed the potential of the drug to impair fertility in humans. Oral administration of 9-desmethyl-beta-dihydrotetrabenazine (8, 15, and 40 mg/kg/day) to pregnant and lactating rats throughout the period of organogenesis produced increases in embryofetal mortality at 15 and 40 mg/kg/day and reductions in fetal body weights at 40 mg/kg/day, which was also maternally toxic. When 9-desmethyl-beta-dihydrotetrabenazine (8, 15, and 40 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to pregnant rats from the beginning of organogenesis through the lactation period, increases in gestation duration, stillbirths, and offspring postnatal mortality (40 mg/kg/day); decreases in pup weights (40 mg/kg/day); and neurobehavioral (increased activity, learning and memory deficits) and reproductive (decreased litter size) impairment (15 and 40 mg/kg/day) were observed. Maternal toxicity was seen at the highest dose. Tetrabenazine and metabolites alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine (a-HTBZ), beta-dihydrotetrabenazine (b-HTBZ), and 9-desmethyl-beta-dihydrotetrabenazine were negative in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay. Tetrabenazine was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the presence of metabolic activation. a-HTBZ and b-HTBZ were clastogenic in an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. In vivo micronucleus assays were conducted in male and female rats and male mice. Tetrabenazine was negative in male mice and rats but produced an equivocal response in female rats.",

It is is indicated for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD) and tardive dyskinesia in adults. HUMAN STUDIES: Overdoses ranging from 100 mg to 1 g have been reported in the literature with tetrabenazine, a closely related vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor. The following adverse reactions occurred with overdosing: acute dystonia, oculogyric crisis, nausea and vomiting, sweating, sedation, hypotension, confusion, diarrhea, hallucinations, rubor, and tremor. Indirect treatment comparison demonstrates that for the treatment of HD chorea, deutetrabenazine has a favorable tolerability profile compared to tetrabenazine. Deutetrabenazine may increase the risk for suicidality in patients with HD. Deutetrabenazine should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Deutetrabenazine and its deuterated alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine and beta-dihydrotetrabenazine metabolites were negative in in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. ANIMAL STUDIES: Oral administration of deutetrabenazine (5, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during organogenesis had no clear effect on embryofetal development. Oral administration of deutetrabenazine (doses of 5, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day) to female rats for 3 months resulted in estrous cycle disruption at all doses. Deutetrabenazine and its deuterated alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine and beta-dihydrotetrabenazine metabolites were negative in in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation and in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice.",

The patient had been treated with tiapride or tetrabenazine alone without any adverse effects before the administration of the combination therapy. She also had advanced breast cancer when the combination therapy was initiated. To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to combination therapy with tetrabenazine and tiapride has not been previously reported. Tetrabenazine should be administered very carefully in combination with other neuroleptic drugs, particularly in patients with a worsening general condition.",

Tetrabenazine is currently the only approved treatment for chorea, an involuntary motor symptom of HD; both compounds influence monoaminergic neurotransmission.  /The objective of the study was/ to investigate pharmacological interactions between pridopidine and tetrabenazine. Drug-interaction experiments, supplemented by dose-response data, examined the effects of these compounds on locomotor activity, on striatal levels of dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and on levels of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) gene expression in the striatum and frontal cortex of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Haloperidol, a classical dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, was also tested for comparison. Monitoring for 1 hour after co-administration of tetrabenazine 0.64 mg/kg and pridopidine 32 mg/kg revealed a reduction in locomotor activity, measured as distance travelled, in the tetrabenazine treated group, down to 61% vs. vehicle controls (p < 0.001). This was significantly alleviated by pridopidine (distance travelled reached 137% vs. tetrabenazine controls, p < 0.01). In contrast, co-administration of haloperidol 0.12 mg/kg and tetrabenazine produced increased inhibition of locomotor activity over the same period (p < 0.01, 41% vs. tetrabenazine). Co-administration of pridopidine, 10.5 mg/kg or 32 mg/kg, with tetrabenazine counteracted significantly (p < 0.05) and dose-dependently the decrease in frontal cortex Arc levels induced by tetrabenazine 0.64 mg/kg (Arc mRNA reached 193% vs. tetrabenazine mean at 32 mg/kg); this counteraction was not seen with haloperidol. Tetrabenazine retained its characteristic neurochemical effects of increased striatal DOPAC and reduced striatal dopamine when co-administered with pridopidine. Pridopidine alleviates tetrabenazine-induced behavioural inhibition in rats. This effect may be associated with pridopidine-induced changes in cortical activity and may justify clinical evaluation of pridopidine/tetrabenazine combination therapy.",

Tetrabenazine was assessed for treating chorea in the TETRA-HD trial, and while efficacious, there are tolerability concerns possibly due to its pharmacokinetic properties. Deutetrabenazine is a novel VMAT2 inhibitor that contains deuterium, which extends active metabolite half-lives and minimizes drug concentration fluctuations. In the First-HD trial, deutetrabenazine was efficacious in treating chorea and was generally well tolerated. In the absence of a head-to-head trial, we performed an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of the tolerability of deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine for the treatment of HD-associated chorea, as observed in the First-HD and TETRA-HD trials, using well-established comparison methods. Data from the Phase III, 12-week, parallel-group, clinical trials First-HD (N=90) and TETRA-HD (N=84) were used to conduct an ITC of the tolerability of deutetrabenazine versus tetrabenazine using two anchor-based methods: Bucher comparison for unadjusted ITCs, and matching indirect comparison for adjusted ITCs. Overall adverse events (AEs; mild, moderate, and severe), serious AEs, specific AEs occurring in >/= 10% of patients, and discontinuations (all-cause and AE-related) were included in the analysis. The risk differences of these outcomes for deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine were estimated by subtracting the applicable placebo-adjusted risk in First-HD from that of TETRA-HD. Sensitivity analyses were performed to address differences between trials, and p-values were obtained from z-tests. Compared with tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine was associated with a significantly lower risk of moderate to severe AEs and neuropsychiatric AEs including agitation, akathisia, depression, depression/agitated depression, drowsiness/somnolence, insomnia, and parkinsonism in both adjusted and unadjusted analyses (p<0.05 for each). Deutetrabenazine had a significantly lower rate of dose reduction or dose reduction/suspension in the unadjusted and adjusted analyses (p<0.001 for each). Deutetrabenazine resulted in numerically more mild AEs, such as diarrhea and coughing; however, these results were not statistically significant.   This indirect treatment comparison demonstrates that for the treatment of HD chorea, deutetrabenazine has a favorable tolerability profile compared to tetrabenazine.",

There have been no prior reports of tardive dyskinesia with this drug. Generalized choreiform dyskinesia developed after 10 months of conventional-dosage tetrabenazine treatment, persisting for several weeks after the drug was discontinued. As might be anticipated from its pharmacological profile, tetrabenazine has the potential to cause tardive dyskinesia. Such an occurrence may be difficult to detect in a clinical population already affected with involuntary movements.",

Tetrabenazine was assessed for treating chorea in the TETRA-HD trial, and while efficacious, there are tolerability concerns possibly due to its pharmacokinetic properties. Deutetrabenazine is a novel VMAT2 inhibitor that contains deuterium, which extends active metabolite half-lives and minimizes drug concentration fluctuations. In the First-HD trial, deutetrabenazine was efficacious in treating chorea and was generally well tolerated. In the absence of a head-to-head trial, we performed an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of the tolerability of deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine for the treatment of HD-associated chorea, as observed in the First-HD and TETRA-HD trials, using well-established comparison methods. Data from the Phase III, 12-week, parallel-group, clinical trials First-HD (N?=?90) and TETRA-HD (N=84) were used to conduct an ITC of the tolerability of deutetrabenazine versus tetrabenazine using two anchor-based methods: Bucher comparison for unadjusted ITCs, and matching indirect comparison for adjusted ITCs. Overall adverse events (AEs; mild, moderate, and severe), serious AEs, specific AEs occurring in =10% of patients, and discontinuations (all-cause and AE-related) were included in the analysis. The risk differences of these outcomes for deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine were estimated by subtracting the applicable placebo-adjusted risk in First-HD from that of TETRA-HD. Sensitivity analyses were performed to address differences between trials, and p-values were obtained from z-tests. Compared with tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine was associated with a significantly lower risk of moderate to severe AEs and neuropsychiatric AEs including agitation, akathisia, depression, depression/agitated depression, drowsiness/somnolence, insomnia, and parkinsonism in both adjusted and unadjusted analyses (p<0.05 for each). Deutetrabenazine had a significantly lower rate of dose reduction or dose reduction/suspension in the unadjusted and adjusted analyses (p<0.001 for each). Deutetrabenazine resulted in numerically more mild AEs, such as diarrhea and coughing; however, these results were not statistically significant.   This indirect treatment comparison demonstrates that for the treatment of HD chorea, deutetrabenazine has a favorable tolerability profile compared to tetrabenazine.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

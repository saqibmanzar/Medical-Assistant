If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

First, the diester is hydrolyzed to monoallyl phthalate (MAP) and allyl alcohol (AA). AA can be oxidized to acrolein and acrylic acid and further metabolized to CO2. Allyl alcohol and acrolein can also react with reduced glutathione to form 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid. Alternatively, allyl alcohol and acrolein can be oxidized to the epoxides glycidol and glycidaldehyde. These epoxides can be hydrolyzed to glycerin and glyceraldehyde or conjugated with reduced glutathione. It is not clear whether DAP is metabolized by this pathway in vivo. However, some of the products of the aforementioned reactions (e.g., monoallyl phthalate, 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid, allyl alcohol) as well as an unidentified polar metabolite have been detected in urine of rats and mice treated with DAP.",

Diallyl phthalate (DAP) is more hepatotoxic to rats than to mice, and demonstrated the same species difference in toxicity for allyl alcohol (AA). The data suggest that the toxicity of diallyl phthalate probably results from allyl alcohol cleaved from diallyl phthalate. To determine if the species difference in susceptibility to hepatotoxicity resulted from differences in the disposition and metabolism of diallyl phthalate, Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice were given 14(C) diallyl phthalate, 1, 10, or 100 mg/kg po or 10 mg/kg iv, and placed in metabolism cages for 24 hr. In rats, 25-30% of the diallyl phthalate was excreted as carbon dioxide, and 50-70% appeared in the urine within 24 hr. In mice, 6-12% of the diallyl phthalate was excreted as carbon dioxide, and 80-90% was excreted in the urine within 24 hr. Monoallyl phthalate (MAP), allyl alcohol, 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (HPMA), and an unidentified polar metabolite (PM) were found in the urine of rats and mice dosed with diallyl phthalate. The polar metabolite was present in the urine of rats dosed with diallyl phthalate or allyl alcohol, indicating that the compound is a metabolite of allyl alcohol. There was no difference between the species in the quantity of allyl alcohol excreted, but mice excreted more monoallyl phthalate (39 vs 33%), 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (28 vs 17%), and polar metabolite (20 vs 8%) than rats.",

Polymerizable acids are esterified in the presence of phenolic inhibitors. The following allyl esters are prepared by this method: diallyl phthalate, diallyl isophthalate, diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, triallyl cyanurate (from cyanuric chloride and allyl alcohol), and diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate). ...",

The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was significantly increased in female rats receiving 100 mg/kg. Because of the variability in the incidence of this neoplasm in aged Fisher 344 rats and the difficulty in definitively diagnosing this lesion in Fisher 344 rats, this increase was considered to be equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity of diallylphthalate in female rats. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male rats.",

The development of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach may also have been related to chemical administration, but the available data are insufficient to indicate a clear cause and effect relationship. An increase in the incidence of male mice with lymphomas was observed, but this increase was considered only to be equivocally related to diallyl phthalate administration. The results of this bioassay, therefore, do not indicate that diallyl phthalate is carcinogenic in B6C3F1 mice, although a maximum tolerated dose may not have been achieved. A carcinogenicity study by the National Toxicology Program of diallyl phthalate in male and female Fisher 344/N rats, employing daily gavage doses of 0 (vehicle control), 50, or 100 mg/kg body weight is currently being evaluated.",

Although deaths occurred at the two highest dose levels, no chemically related lesions were observed in these or any other treatment groups. In a longer-term study, 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day DAP was administered to B6C3F1 mice by gavage 5 days/wk for 13 wk. Mean body weight gain was decreased by 12% in the high-dose group compared to the control group. No other substance-related clinical effects were seen, and no effects were observed during the macroscopical and histopathological examination. The NOEL was given by the authors as 200 mg/kg.",

The diallyl phthalate doses used in the 2 year studies were chosen on the basis of 13 week studies, wherein doses of 200 or 400 mg/kg caused death, reductions in body weight gains, or periportal hepatocellular necrosis and fibrosis in both sexes. Mean body weights and survival of male and female rats administered diallyl phthalate were essentially the same as those of the vehicle controls throughout the 2 year studies, although hepatotoxicity was produced in both sexes by the 100 mg/kg dose. Based on the results of the prechronic studies and the effects on the liver in the 2 year studies, the doses used in the 2 year studies were considered to be adequate for carcinogenicity testing. Male and female rats receiving the 100 mg/kg dose of diallyl phthalate in the 2 year studies developed chronic liver disease characterized by periportal fibrosis, periportal accumulation of pigment, and severe bile duct hyperplasia. Pigment accumulation also occurred at the 50 mg/kg dose in both sexes. Diallylphthalate administration increased the occurrence of mononuclear cell leukemia in female rats (p <0.05 by trend tests), and the incidence in the 100 mg/kg dose female rats was greater (p <0.05) than in the vehicle controls by pairwise comparisons (vehicle control, 15/50, 30%; low dose, 15/43, 35%; high dose, 25/49, 51%). An increased occurrence of mononuclear cell leukemia was not observed in male rats receiving diallylphthalate. ... Under the conditions of this study, the administration of diallyl phthalate by gavage in corn oil to male and female F344/N rats for 2 years caused chronic liver disease characterized by periportal fibrosis and pigment accumulation and an increased severity of bile duct hyperplasia. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was significantly increased in female rats receiving 100 mg/kg. Because of the variability in the incidence of this neoplasm in aged Fischer 344 rats and the difficulty in definitively diagnosing this lesion in Fischer 344 rats, this increase was considered to be equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity of diallyl phthalate in female rats. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male rats.",

Survival rates and mean body weights of dosed mice were not different from those of vehicle controls, and pathological lesions unrelated to proliferative changes were not observed. Therefore, a maximally tolerated dose for the purposes of carcinogenicity testing may not have been achieved. The incidences of lymphoma or either lymphoma & leukemia in dosed male mice were not significantly greater than those in the controls according to pairwise comparisons (p= 0.051 to p=0.096), but the trend tests were statistically significant by either life table or incidental tumor analyses (p= 0.031 to p= 0.045). The incidence of lymphomas in the high dose male mice was 12/50 (24%) in comparison with 6/50 (12%) in the controls. Recent historical incidences at the performing laboratory and in the NTP Bioassay Program were 18/120 (15%) and 71/661 (11%), respectively. Since the incidence of high dose male mice with leukemia was not significantly greater than that of concurrent or historical controls at the performing laboratory by pairwise comparisons, this marginal increase was considered only to be equivocally related to diallyl phthalate administration. Increased incidences of squamous cell papillomas, hyperplasia, and inflammatory lesions of the forestomach were observed in diallyl phthalate dosed mice of both sexes in a dose related manner. Because of the numerical elevation of forestomach papillomas in high dose mice of both sexes, the concomitant observation of dose related forestomach hyperplasia, and the rarity of this tumor in corn oil (gavage) control B6C3F1 mice, the development of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach may have been related to diallyl phthalate administration. Under the conditions of this bioasssay, the development of chronic inflammation and hyperplasia of the forestomach in both male and female B6C3F1 mice was considered to be related to the administration of diallyl phthalate. The development of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach may also have been related to chemical administration, but the available data are insufficient to indicate a clear cause and effect relationship. An increase in the incidence of male mice with lymphomas was observed, but this increase was considered only to be equivocally related to diallyl phthalate administration. The results of this bioassay, therefore, do not indicate that diallyl phthalate is carcinogenic in B6C3F1 mice, although a maximally tolerated dose may not have been achieved.",

Animals collected from North Atlantic Sea were exposed to the contaminants independently under controlled laboratory conditions. One hundred and eleven spots showed a significant increase or decrease in protein abundance in the two-dimensional electrophoresis maps from the groups exposed to pollutants. ... A unique protein expression signature of exposure to each of those chemical compounds /was obtained/. Moreover a set of proteins composed a proteomic signature in common to the three independent exposures. It is remarkable that the principal component analysis of these spots showed a discernible separation between groups, and so did the hierarchical clustering into four classes. The 14 proteins identified by MS participate in alpha- and beta-oxidation pathways, xenobiotic and amino acid metabolism, cell signaling, oxyradical metabolism, peroxisomal assembly, respiration, and the cytoskeleton. ...",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.2X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diallyl phthalate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diallyl phthalate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 6.9 and 11 hours, respectively. The UV spectrum of diallyl phthalate in water was found to have absorbance near 275.5 and 281 nm and is expected to have absorption shoulders which extend beyond 290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diallyl phthalate is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,360. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.9X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation at 92% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test suggests that biodegradation will be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, diallyl phthalate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 61 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 1.0 year and 37 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to diallyl phthalate may occur through inhalation of aerosols and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diallyl phthalate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to diallyl phthalate via dermal contact with products containing diallyl phthalate. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.9X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 61(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Hydrolysis is expected to be an important process(SRC) based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 1.0 year and 37 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively(7). Biodegradation at 92% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test(8) suggests that biodegradation will be a rapid environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

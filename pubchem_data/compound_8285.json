Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

The chemical is used as intermediate for alkyd resin, rosin ester, explosive and lubricants. No consumer use is reported... Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) of the chemical was determined using a Daphnia magna 48 h immobility data (600 mg/L). The assessment factor of 1000 used to an acute toxicity data to determine PNEC, ... , because only one acute toxicity data is available among algae, cladocera and fishes. Thus, PNEC of the chemical is determined as 0.6 mg/l, tentatively. Thus, PEC / PNEC is 0.0072. Effects of the chemical on aquatic ecosystems are of low concern at present. Pentaerythritol was not mutagenic in bacterial and chromosomal aberration tests in vitro. The chemical is not considered as an irritant to the skin and the eyes, nor as a sensitizer. In a combined repeat dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity screening test, both male and female rats showed only soft feces and diarrhea. The chemical did not show any toxicity to parents and offspring. The no observed effect levels were 100 mg/kg/day for repeated dose toxicity and 1000 mg/kg/day for reproductive/developmental toxicity. For human health, the risk for workers is expected to be low because the margin of safety is 83.3 as the worst case. The risks for consumer and the general population through indirect exposure are also assumed to be low because a margin of safety through drinking water or fish is calculated to be 6.98 x 10+5 or 7.38 x 10+6.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.5X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pentaerythritol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pentaerythritol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 26 hrs. Particulate-phase pentaerythritol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Pentaerythritol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pentaerythritol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.1X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 13.2% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 25 days indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. However, aerobic biodegradation test results for pentaerythritol do show varying results. If released into water, pentaerythritol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF range of 0.3-2.1 using carp (Cyprinus carpio) suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to pentaerythritol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pentaerythritol is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to pentaerythritol via inhalation and dermal contact with this compound or other consumer products containing pentaerythritol. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.1X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(5). According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF range of 0.3-2.1 using carp (Cyprinus carpio)(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 13.2% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 25 days(7) indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). However, aerobic biodegradation test results for pentaerythritol do show varying results(8).",

Vapor-phase pentaerythritol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 26 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.48X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Particulate-phase pentaerythritol may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). Pentaerythritol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The difference between the two test methods is that while the COD method did account for the carbon loss due to assimilation by the bacteria as biomass, the carbon dioxide evolution method did not(3). The lag or delay time for the biodegradation of pentaerythritol has been reported to be 3 to 15 days(1). Besides acclimation of the bacteria, an optimum concn of viable cells may be required for the biodegradation of pentaerythritol and this number is on the order of 10,000 viable cells/L(2).",

However, the fraction sorbed to airborne particulates may be resistant to atmospheric oxidation(3). Pentaerythritol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Pentaerythritol in aqueous solution reacts with chlorine(5). However, due to non-availability of kinetic data, the importance of the chlorination process during the treatment of waste water and drinking water can not be determined(SRC). Pentaerythritol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

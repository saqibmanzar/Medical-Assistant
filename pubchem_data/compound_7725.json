When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Exhaust from outboard motors, automobiles and trucks, and emissions from burning wood contain 4-methylbenzaldehyde. 4-Methylbenzaldehyde was a natural component detected in raw earth almonds (Cyperus esculentus L.). If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.25 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-methylbenzaldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-methylbenzaldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hrs. 4-Methylbenzaldehyde contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 4-methylbenzaldehyde is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 62. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 4-Methylbenzaldehyde may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Based on limited data, biodegradation of 4-methylbenzaldehyde will take place in both soil and water. Pure cultures of Pseudomonas and yeast were able to utilize 4-methylbenzaldehyde as a carbon source. If released into water, 4-methylbenzaldehyde is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 and 21 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 8 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 4-methylbenzaldehyde may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-methylbenzaldehyde is produced or used. Monitoring data and use information indicate that the general population may be exposed to 4-methylbenzaldehyde via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and dermal contact with this compound.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.25 mm Hg(4), and its water solubility(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 and 21 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 8(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Based on limited data, biodegradation of 4-methylbenzaldehyde will take place in water(SRC). A Pseudomonas strain was able to utilize 4-methylbenzaldehyde as the sole carbon source(6); a yeast strain grown with both this compound and either sucrose or pyruvate biodegraded 4-methylbenzaldehyde to the respective aromatic carbinol or alcohol(7).",

Vapor-phase 4-methylbenzaldehyde is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.8X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The reactivity of 4-methylbenzaldehyde (1 ppm) with NOx (0.5 ppm) in light was measured in a smog chamber as 1.78 ppb/min(4). 4-Methylbenzaldehyde contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

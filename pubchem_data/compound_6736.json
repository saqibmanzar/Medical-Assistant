When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Human lung microsomes were prepared from eight organ transplantation donors and liver microsomes from one of the donors were /selected/. The 3MI turnover rate with human lung microsomes was 0.23 +/- 0.06 nmol/mg/min, which was lower than the rate with the human liver microsomes (7.40 mnol/mg/min). The activities were NADPH dependent and inhibited by l-aminobenzotriazole, a potent cytochrome p450 suicide substrate inhibitor. Covalent binding of 3MI reactive intermediates to human tissues was determined by incubation of (14)C-3MI and NADPH with human lung and liver microsomal proteins. Although human lung microsomes displayed measurable covalent binding activity (2.74 +/- 2.57 pmol/mg/min), the magnitude of this reaction was only 4% as large as that seen with human liver microsomes and also was inhibited by l-aminobenzotriazole. Therefore, the bioactivation of 3MI to covalently binding intermediates is catalyzed by cytochrome p450 in human pulmonary tissues. These activities were compared to those activities measured with tissues from goats. Proteins from goat and human pulmonary and hepatic microsomal incubations were incubated with radioactive 3MI, and radioactive proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and HPLC and visualized by autoradiography and radiochromatography, respectively. The results showed that a 57-kDa protein was clearly the most prominently alkylated target associated with 3MI reactive intermediates. These data suggest that humans may be susceptible to 3MI mediated toxicities and that the specificity of covalent binding and the extent of binding to target proteins may play important roles in organ and species selective susceptibilities to 3MI pneumotoxicity.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

It is also produced industrially for use as a fixative in the perfume industry and as a food additive and may be released to the environment from a variety of waste streams. It has an extrapolated vapor pressure of 0.005 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C and exists solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere. An estimated Koc value of 600 indicates that 3-methylindole has low mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mol. A methanogenic consortium, enriched from wetland soil completely mineralized this compound. In water, 3-methylindole may adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based upon its Koc value. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon its estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 20 and 148 days respectively. When exposed to natural sunlight 3-methylindole may undergo aqueous photo-oxidation. The major product of the photo-oxidative degradation of 3-methylindole is thought to be o-(N-formyl)aminoacetophenone. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is considered moderate, not high based upon the estimated BCF value of 56. No data currently exists on workplace exposure to 3-methylindole. The general population may be exposed to 3-methylindole by consumption of contamined groundwater although groundwater monitoring data are limited. (SRC)",

Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 20 and 148 days, respectively(1,SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF value of 56(1,SRC), from an experimental log Kow(4), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate, not high(SRC). When exposed to natural sunlight 3-methylindole may undergo photo-oxidative degradation. The aqueous rate constant for the photolysis of 3-methylindole was measured as 0.18 hr-1 with a half life of 3.8 hours(6). The major product of the aqueous photo-oxidative degradation of 3-methylindole is thought to be o-(N-formyl)aminoacetophenone(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This value indicates that 3-methylindole will volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 20 days(3,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 148 days(3,SRC). 3-Methylindole's Henry's Law constant(1,2,SRC) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces will not be important(SRC).",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital.",

Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of both sexes were administered chloramben at one of two doses, either 10,000 or 20,000 ppm. The rats were treated for 80 wk, then observed for 32 or 33 wk; the mice were treated for 80 wk, then observed for 11 or 12 wk. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 untreated rats and 10 untreated mice of each sex; pooled controls, used for statistical evaluation, consisted of these matched controls combined with 75 untreated male and 75 untreated female rats or 70 untreated male and 70 untreated female mice from similarly performed bioassays of six other test chemicals. Surviving rats were killed at 112 or 113 wk; surviving mice were killed at 91 or 92 wk. In male rats, hemangiomas occurred at a significantly higher incidence in the low dose animals than in the pooled controls (controls 0/73, low dose 5/48, p=0.009). This lesion was not considered to be related to chloramben administration, since the tumor did not occur at a significantly higher incidence in the high dose group than in the pooled control group, and the incidences did not show a significant dose related trend. In both male and female mice, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma showed significant dose related trends using pooled control (for females controls: 2/67, low dose 7/48, high dose 10/50, p=0.004). Direct comparisons showed significantly higher incidences of the tumor in low dose males (p=0.008) and in the high dose females (p=0.003) than in the pooled controls. Probability levels of p=0.028 in high dose males and p=0.027 in low dose females were attained. In male mice, however, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was considered only marginally associated with the administration of chloramben because of variations in the spontaneous incidence of this lesion in male mice encountered at this laboratory. Under the conditions of this bioassay, there were no tumors in Osborne-Mendel rats that were significantly related to administration of the chemical. In B6C3F1 female mice, chloramben was carcinogenic, producing hepatocellular carcinomas in treated animals. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: Male Rats: Negative; Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Equivocal; Female Mice: Positive.",

If released to the air, Amiben may exist in the particulate or the vapor phase. Particulate phase Amiben may rapidly photodegrade while vapor phase Amiben will degrade relatively rapidly by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of about 15 hrs). The pKa of the Amiben -COOH group is approximately 3 and the pKa of the Amiben -NH2 group is expected to be <4.6, thereby allowing adsorption of protonated Amiben at low pHs. If released to water, Amiben should not volatilize, bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms, or hydrolyze. In surface water exposed to sunlight, Amiben will photodegrade rapidly (half-life of about 6 hr). In water and soil, Amiben may chemically bind to soil and sediments with higher adsorption occurring either at a low pH with a low organic matter content or at a neutral pH with a high organic matter content. Biodegradation in nonsterile soils may occur via decarboxylation; however, the rate of microbial degradation is expected to depend on the organic content, temperature, and moisture content. On soil surfaces, some Amiben may photodegrade. Workers may be exposed to Amiben by dermal contact or inhalation during the application of Amiben as a herbicide. The general public may be exposed to Amiben through drinking water or groundwater supplies in which it has been detected. (SRC)",

According to a bioassay using the soybean plant and 50 ppm Amiben in soil, there was no breakdown of Amiben over an 11-month incubation period in moist soil at 15 \u00b0C; at incubation temperatures of 25 and 35 \u00b0C, Amiben breakdown over an 11-month period was 42 and 46 percent, respectively(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Amiben was more strongly adsorbed to soil with high organic matter content; furthermore, adsorption of Amiben to soil particles significantly reduced herbicidal activity(5). Based on adsorption studies of 12 soils, a mean Koc value of 190 was determined for amiben(1). In another adsorption study, an experimental Koc value of 21 was determined for Amiben(2). These Koc values indicate that Amiben will have high to very high mobility in soil and will leach(4). However, protonated Amiben may exhibit higher adsorption at lower pHs than its Koc values indicate(SRC).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The effects of TCE on CD4+ T cells were linked in the present study to the ability of TCE metabolite, trichloroacetaldehyde hydrate (TCAH), to inhibit activation-induced cell death (AICD) in CD4+ T cells. TCAH attenuated AICD in CD4+ T cells by decreasing FasL (CD178) expression but not by altering Fas (CD95) expression or by interfering with Fas-signaling events following direct engagement of the Fas receptor. The TCAH-induced decrease in FasL expression did not appear to be mediated at the transcriptional level but was instead due to increased shedding of FasL from the surface of the CD4+ T cells. The ability of TCAH to cleave FasL and thereby decrease AICD appeared to be mediated by metalloproteinases and correlated with a TCAH-induced increase in matrix metalloproteinase-7. Thus, this study presents the novel finding that the environmental contaminant TCE works via its metabolite TCAH to attenuate AICD by increasing metalloproteinase activity that cleaves FasL from CD4+ T cells. This represents a mechanism by which an environmental trigger inhibits AICD in CD4+ T cells and may thereby promote CD4+ T cell-mediated autoimmune disease.",

The purpose of the present study was to characterize the kinetics of trichloroethylene (TRI) oxidation in male and female mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes to possibly allow for a better assessment of human risk. Methods were developed to detect and quantitate chloral, trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, chloroacetic acid, glyoxylic acid, and oxalic acid, known TRI metabolites in rodents or humans. However, only chloral and its further metabolite, trichloroethanol, were consistently detected in the various liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH. Chloral was the major metabolite detected, and its levels were species- and sex-dependent; the amounts of trichloroethanol detected were also species- and sex-dependent but never exceeded 15% of total metabolites. Double-reciprocal plots of metabolite formation with male and female rat and human liver microsomes indicated biphasic kinetics, but this trend was not observed with microsomes from male or female mouse liver. The Vmax data are consistent, with male and female mice being more susceptible to TRI-induced liver carcinogenicity than male rats. However, the Vmax/Km ratios in male and female rat liver microsomes, in comparison with the male mouse liver microsomes, did not correlate with tumor incidences in these tissues. Furthermore, as only two out of six human liver samples examined exhibited Vmax/Km ratios similar or higher than the ratio obtained with male mouse liver, humans may vary in their toxic response after TRI exposure.",

The damage seen in mouse lung Clara cells is caused by an accumulation of chloral resulting from high rates of metabolism of trichloroethylene but poor clearance of chloral to trichloroethanol and its glucuronide. The activity and distribution of the key metabolizing enzymes in this pathway have been compared in mouse, rat, and human lung. While mouse lung microsomal fractions were able to metabolize trichloroethylene to chloral at significant rates, the rate in rat lung was 23-fold lower and a rate could not be detected in human lung microsomes at all. Immunolocalization of cytochrome P450IIE1 in lung sections revealed high concentrations in mouse lung Clara cells with lesser amounts in type II cells. Lower levels of enzyme could be detected in Clara cells of rat lung, but not at all in human lung sections. Western blots of lung tissues from the three species and of mouse lung Clara cells were entirely consistent with these observations...",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Endogeneously formed chlorinated tetrahydro-beta-carbolines found by Bringmann 1995 (TaClo hypothesis) may contribute, in particular, to the development of (idiopathic) Parkinson's disease (PD) in the presence of the sufficient amount of trichloroacetaldehyde, an intermediate in metabolism of trichloroethylene (TRI). Long-term storage of specific VOSs over years, evident frrom exhalation pattern during the postexposure period, may serve as a promoting factor to form continuously TaClo non-enzymatically from tryptamine and trichloroacetaldehyde. Thus, the induction of TaClo-mediated neurotoxic processes extends over years. The onset of Parkinson's disease in three chronic TRI-exposed individuals during the postexposure period could be associated with the presence of TaClo in ng-range. Consequently, determination of TaClo and its derivatives in blood of humans exposed to chlorinated VOSs may serve as a marker of risk indicating either causative or supportive processes of neurodegeneration that may lead to manifestation of PD after many years.",

Gemale MRL+/+ mice were treated for 40 weeks with trichloroacetaldehyde hydrate (TCAH), a metabolite of trichloroethylene in the drinking water. The results were compared with the data from an earlier study in which MRL+/+ mice were exposed to TCAH for 4 weeks. Following a 40-week exposure, the mice developed skin inflammation and dose-dependent alopecia. In addition, TCAH appeared to modulate the CD4(+) T-cell subset by promoting the expression of an activated/effector (i.e., CD62L(lo)) phenotype with an increased capacity to secrete the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma. However, unlike what was observed after only 4 weeks of exposure, TCAH did not significantly attenuate activation-induced cell death (AICD) or the expression of the death receptor FasL in CD4(+) T cells. Some metalloproteinases (MMPs) are thought to play a role in susceptibility to AICD by inducing FasL shedding. Thus, both the 4- and 40-week sera were tested for MMP-7 levels in an attempt to explain the disparate results of TCAH on AICD and FasL expression. Serum MMP-7 levels were significantly higher in mice exposed to TCAH for 4 weeks. In contrast, the serum MMP-7 levels were increased in all the mice by 40 weeks when compared with a nonautoimmune strain. Taken together, a chronic exposure to TCAH promotes alopecia and skin inflammation. The early effects of TCAH on MMP-7 levels may provide a mechanism by which TCAH promotes skin pathology.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 50 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chloral will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase chloral will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 days. Chloral exhibited a photolysis lifetime of 4.5 to 6 hours under conditions of solar flux in summer months; therefore, it is susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, chloral is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 0.68. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.91X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Chloral may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The compound reached 8% of its theoretical BOD in the Japanese MITI test, indicating that biodegradation is not likely to be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, chloral is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Chloral reacts exothermically with water to form chloral hydrate, with which it is in equilibrium. Occupational exposure to chloral may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chloral is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to chloral via ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

Trichloroacetaldehyde has been found at low concentrations in spent chlorination liquor from bleaching of various sulphite pulps. Effluents from wood processing plants, therefore, may be a source of trichloroacetaldehyde release to the environment(2). It has been suggested that trichloroacetaldehyde is formed during chlorination by the reaction of chlorine with residual organic compounds in the water(3) and trichloroacetaldehyde was identified as a reaction product of soil humus and aqueous chlorine(4). Chloral was formed as a result of chlorination of soil humic material using samples from the Ao horizon of a forest at Gifu City, Japan, forested predominantly with Chemaecyparis obtusa (Hinko) and Pinus densiflora (Pine wood)(4). The humic substances contained 34.0% carbon, 4.0% hydrogen, 4.1% nitrogen, and 11.6% ash with a C/N ratio of 8.3(4).",

Vapor-phase chloral is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.60X10-12 cu cm/molec-sec(3). Chloral exhibited a photodissociation rate of 4.61 to 6.11X10-5/sec, corresponding to photolysis lifetime of 4.5 to 6 hours under conditions of solar flux in summer months(4) and therefore is susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Chloral reacts exothermically with water to form chloral hydrate(2), with which it is in equilibrium. Since the equilibrium constant of chloral to chloral hydrate reaction is 3.6X10-5, very little chloral will remain in solution(3). Chloral exhibited a photodissociation rate of 4.61 to 6.11X10-5/sec, corresponding to photolysis lifetime of 4.5 to 6 hours under conditions of solar flux in summer months(4) and therefore is susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Since chloral reacts rapidly with water to form chloral hydrate, it is probable that it was this latter compound which was in the water and that the chloral was formed during the analytical \"purge and trap\" procedure(SRC). Chloral is formed as a result of chlorinating agents reacting with naturally occurring nitrogenous aquatic humic materials; it is the major volatile product of the chlorination of uracil(3). The expected median concentration in drinking water is 2 ug/L with a highest reported concentration being 19 ug/L(4).",

Chloral was detected not quantified in water samples collected in 6 of 10 US cities as part of the US National Organics Reconnaissance Survey initiated in 1974(2). The compound was identified in treated water samples tested in the United Kingdom(3). Since chloral reacts rapidly with water to form chloral hydrate, it is probable that it was this latter compound which was in the water and that the chloral was formed during the analytical \"purge and trap\" procedure(SRC).",

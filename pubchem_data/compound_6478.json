It is made by adding chlorine to cyclopentadiene, or by removing chlorine from octachlorocyclopentane. HCCPD is used to make a group of related pesticides (aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, endosulfan, endrin, heptachlor, isodrin, mirex, and pentac) referred to cyclodienes. Only two of these pesticides, endosulfan and pentac, are currently registered for use in the United States. (L437)",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Biliary excretion of only 16% with 66% still voided in the feces of bile duct cannulated rats suggested that the majority of orally consumed HEX was not absorbed. Degradation apparently occurred in the gut since little of the fecal material was of an apolar nature. The kidney, liver, ovaries and fat were the major sites of deposition of (14)C-HEX equivalents. In rats, the kidney contained the highest levels of residues, whereas in mice the residues in the liver exceeded those in the kidney. Other than this difference, the fate of HEX in rats and mice, both male and female, was quite similar and in each case the tissue residues reached a plateau after about two weeks on the HEX-containing diets.",

Tissue, urine, and feces samples were analyzed, as well as expired air, to assess the fate and retention time. Approximately 84% of the inhaled compound is retained. Inhaled (14)C-hexachlorocyclopentadiene excreted in the urine; orally administered (14)C-hexachlorocyclopentadiene eliminated in the feces. In rats exposed by inhalation, the trachea and lung had the highest residue accumulation. In animals receiving oral doses kidneys and liver were major sites of accumulation.

Route of excretion was via the feces (-70% of dose) with low elimination in the urine (approximately 15%). Biliary excretion of only 16% still voided in the feces of bile duct cannulated rats suggested that the majority of orally consumed HEX was not absorbed. Degradation apparently occurred in the gut since little of the fecal material was of an apolar nature. The kidney, liver, ovaries and fat were the major sites of deposition of (14)C-HEX equivalents. In rats, the kidney contained the highest levels of residues, whereas in mice the residues in the liver exceeded those in the kidney. Other than this difference, the fate of HEX in rats and mice, both male and female, was quite similar and in each case the tissue residues reached a plateau after about two weeks on the HEX-containing diets.",

In an apparent first-order kinetic process, HEX was metabolized by gut content, fecal, and liver homogenates with half-lives of 10.6, 1.6, and 14.2 hr, respectively. When mercuric chloride (HgCl2) was added to the gut and fecal homogenates as a bacteriocide, the half-lives were increased to 17.2 and 6.2 hr, respectively, indicating that the gut and fecal flora contributed significantly to the metabolism of HEX. Denaturation of the liver homogenate had virtually no effect on the in vitro metabolic rate indicating, perhaps, that there was only limited involvement of liver microsomes or other enzyme-dependent process.",

Biological tissues contain a large number of potential reactants for cycloaddition reactions (quinones, sterols, 2-alkenoic acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and unsaturated fatty acid derivatives). HCCPD can also undergo addition and substitution reactions or be oxidized by way of the mixed function oxidase system. The attack of HCCPD on tissues can be regarded as a 2-phase phenomenon. Primary lesions are formed by direct contact of the material with exposed tissues (nasal passages, lungs, forestomach, and skin). These lesions can be hypothesized to result from reactions of HCCPD or one of its metabolites with epithelial cells impairing function and resulting in cell death. Once exposure ceases, new cells replace the damaged ones, and slow recovery begins. Secondary lesions form at sites distant from the point of contact when systemic circulation carries unreacted HCCPD or a metabolite to lungs, liver, kidney, heart, brain, and adrenals. These tissues may become targets for HCCPD by virtue of their physiological function (liver and kidney) or the tendency for their cell products or membrane components to react with HCCPD or an HCCPD metabolite (lung, adrenal).",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It can be postulated, that some of its toxic properties are a consequence of its reactivity in Diels-Alder reactions where a conjugated diene combines with a substituted or unsubstituted alkene (a dienophile) in a cycloaddition reaction. Biological tissues contain a large number of potential reactants for cycloaddition reactions. HCCPD can also undergo addition and substitution reactions or be oxidized by way of the mixed function oxidase system. Effects of HCCPD on the brain may also be a reflection of the reaction of either HCCPD or a metabolite with brain lipids. The effects of HCCPD on the adrenal glands may be a reflection of its ability to combine with the unsaturated carbons in sterols produced by this gland. The hydroxyl functional group of a sterol is on a carbon adjacent to the double bond and can activate that bond to cycloaddition reactions. Such reactions would require exposure to large doses of HCCPD so that reactive material would reach the adrenal gland. HCCPD is excreted in urine and feces. (L437)",

Their vital status was determined through 1978. The expected numbers of deaths, based on the USA population and specific for sex, age, and calendar year, were calculated. The SMR for all causes of death was 69. Deaths caused by specific cancers, all cancers, and diseases of the circulatory and digestive systems were also fewer than expected. The authors noted that the time that had elapsed since the initial exposure (25 years at most) reduced the power of the study to detect cancers that may have a 10-40 yr latent period."

No atypical cells were observed in blood films of either sex. Females in the medium exposure group had a significantly reduced level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood when compared to controls. Urine analysis did not show any changes that could be attributed to exposure. Kidney weights were significantly increased in females in the high exposure group. Following exposure, and after a 14 week recovery period, significant effects were observed on heart, spleen, and testes weights in males but these were not considered to be biologically significant by the investigators.

Histopathology was performed on all groups. Pathology was observed in the kidneys of males and females and in the forestomachs of males receiving daily doses greater than 19 mg/kg. Pathology was observed in the forestomachs of females receiving doses greater than 10 mg/kg.",

Animals in the high-dose groups were sneezing and lethargic and 4 males and 2 females died during exposure. There were significant increases observed in the treated animals versus controls in the following: mean erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and absolute numbers of neutrophils (males at 0.5 and 0.1 ppm), pulmonary degenerative changes ranging from epithelial hyperplasia, to edema and sloughing of the bronchiolar epithelium (both sexes at 0.5 ppm), epithelial ulceration and necrosis (males at 0.5 ppm), kidney weights (females at 0.5 ppm), and testes weights (males at 0.5 and 0.1 ppm). There were significant decreases in the following: body weights (males at 0.5 ppm and females at 0.5 and 0.1 ppm), percentage lymphocyte counts (males at 0.5 and 0.1 ppm), mean absolute numbers of lymphocytes (females at 0.5 ppm), heart weight (males at 0.5 ppm) and spleen weight (males at 0.5 and 0.2 ppm). Mild degenerative changes were observed in the liver and kidney of some high exposure group rats after 30 weeks. There were no significant effects reported in the urinalysis results.",

Compared to pre-hexachlorocyclopentadiene values, hexachlorocyclopentadiene increased oxygen  consumption rates by 186 + or - 24%, with maximum oxygen consumption rates being reached in 84 min after hexachlorocyclopentadiene exposure. Oxygen consumption subsequently decreased, and all hexachlorocyclopentadiene exposed fish died within 6.5 hr of exposure. Fish exposed to hexachlorocyclopentadiene free vehicle (acetone) showed no changes of oxygen consumption. When added to normal isolated trout heart mitochondria, hexachlorocyclopentadiene appeared to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, with calculated respiratory control ratios being decreased 50% from control values at a hexachlorocyclopentadiene concentration of 0.41 umole.",

The 96-hr LC50 value was 7 ug/L. The 96-hr mortality data indicated a sharp toxicity threshold, such that 94% survival was observed at 3.7 ug/L, 70% at 7.3 ug/L, and 2% at 9.1 ug/L. At the end of the 30-day exposure period, mortality was only slightly higher, with 90% survival at 3.7 ug/L, 66% at 7.3 ug/L, and 0% at 9.1 ug/L. These results indicated that the median lethal threshold, the lowest concentration causing 50% mortality, was reached within 4 days. In addition, the HEX residues found in fathead minnows at the end of the 30-day tests were low (<0.1 ug/g), and a BCF value of <11 was reported. The authors concluded that the toxicity data and the BCF values indicated that HEX was non-cumulative in fish, i.e. it did not bioconcentrate in fish as a result of continuous low-level exposure to HEX. The growth rate of surviving larvae, measured in terms of both body length and weight, did not decrease significantly at any of the concentrations tested, compared with the controls. This was true even at 7.3 ug/L, a level greater than the calculated LC50 value. Based on these toxicity and growth data, /it was/ concluded that 3.7 ug/L is the highest concentration of HEX that produces no adverse effects on fathead minnow larvae."

It has previously been used as a biocide. If released to air a vapor pressure of 0.060 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates that hexachlorocyclopentadiene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase hexachlorocyclopentadiene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 29 days. Hexachlorocyclopentadiene absorbs light greater than 290 nm and direct photolysis is an important degradation pathway. Hexachlorocyclopentadiene adsorbed onto silica gel, underwent 46.0% photomineralization when irradiated with UV light (>290 nm) for 17 hours. If released to soil, an average Koc value of 4,265 indicates that hexachlorocyclopentadiene is expected to have low mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important environmental fate process based on a Henry's Law constant of 0.027 atm-cu m/mole; however, adsorption to soil may attenuate volatilization. Volatilization losses of 0.84-1.60% from moist sand, 0.35-0.67% from moist loam, and 0.15-0.285% from moist humus were observed over a two hour period in a laboratory study, carried out at 25 \u00b0C. Hexachlorocyclopentadiene is susceptible to direct photolysis, hydrolysis and biodegradation on soil surfaces with losses of over 90% in unsterilized soil subjected to natural sunlight over a 7 day period. If released to water, hexachlorocyclopentadiene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based on the average Koc value. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant; however, adsorption may attenuate volatilization from water. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 7 days, respectively if adsorption is neglected. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is estimated as 37 days if adsorption is considered. Hexachlorocyclopentadiene photodegrades rapidly in sunlit surface waters with a photodegradation half-life on the order of several minutes to over an hour. Hydrolytic half-lives ranging from several hours to 2-3 weeks are expected for hexachlorocyclopentadiene under environmental conditions. BCF values on the range of 100-1354 measured in fish, suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Occupational exposure to hexachlorocyclopentadiene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hexachlorocyclopentadiene is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of hexachlorocyclopentadiene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 0.027 atm-cu m/mole(3). Hexachlorocyclopentadiene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based on a vapor pressure of 0.060 mm Hg(4). Volatilization losses of 0.84-1.60% from moist sand, 0.35-0.67% from moist loam, and 0.15-0.285% from moist humus were observed over a two hour period in a laboratory study, carried out at 25 \u00b0C, where the initial hexachlorocyclopentadiene concentration was 50 ug/kg soil on a dry weight basis(5). Radiolabeled hexachlorocyclopentadiene at an initial concentration of 1 mg/kg was added to soil contained in a glass flask covered with perforated aluminum foil and kept on a laboratory shelf which was exposed to sunlight. After 7 days incubation, recovery of nonpolar compounds (hexachlorocyclopentadiene and nonpolar metabolites) was 6.1% in unaltered, nonsterile soil (approx 72% was polar and nonextractable), approx 6% in nonsterile soil at pH 4, approx 9% in nonsterile soil at pH 8, 36.1% in autoclaved soil (33.5% was polar and nonextractable), approx 15% in sodium azide treated soil, and approx 3% in flooded (anaerobic) soil. These data indicate that loss of hexachlorocyclopentadiene from soil is the result of abiotic and biotic degradation(6).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.027 atm-cu m/mole(4); however adsorption may attenuate volatilization(3). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 7 days, respectively if adsorption is ignored(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is estimated as 37 days if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), BCF values in the range of 100-1354 measured in fish(7-10), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC).If released to water, hexachlorocyclopentadiene will degrade primarily by photolysis and chemical hydrolysis. During daylight hours, hexachlorocyclopentadiene found in clear, shallow water is expected to photodegrade with a half-life on the order of several minutes(4). 2,3,4,4,5-Pentachloro-2-cyclopentenone, hexachloro-2-cyclopentenone, and hexachloro-3-cyclopentenone have been identified as primary photodegradation products of hexachlorocyclopentadiene. In unlit or deep, turbid water, chemical hydrolysis is expected to be an important fate process. Hydrolytic half-lives ranging from several hours to 2-3 weeks are predicted for waters with temperatures in the range of 20-30 \u00b0C(4,11). An aqueous screening test showed that hexachlorocyclopentadiene was totally degraded in 7 days using domestic wastewater as inoculum(12). Both hydrolysis and biodegradation were potential degradation pathways.",

Hexachlorocyclopentadiene absorbs light greater than 290 nm(4) and has been shown to undergo direct photolysis rapidly(5). Hexachlorocyclopentadiene adsorbed onto silica gel, underwent 46.0% photomineralization when irradiated with UV light (>290 nm) for 17 hours(5).",

Based on hydrolytic half-life data for this compound, hydrolysis alone does not necessarily account for the 100% observed loss of hexachlorocyclopentadiene. Volatilization was reported to be insignificant. Thus, some of the observed loss may have been due to biodegradation(SRC).

These values correspond to photolytic half-lives of 2-11 minutes for distilled water and 2-8.5 minutes for natural waters(SRC). These data indicate that suspended solids had little effect on photolysis rates as compared to photolysis rates in distilled water(1). As part of this same study photolysis of hexachlorocyclopentadiene on an overcast November day was found to be slightly slower in natural waters containing humic materials (half-life 8 minutes) compared to distilled water (half-life 6 minutes), probably due to light attenuation(1). Photolysis half-lives for hexachlorocyclopentadiene in tap water, natural water, and deionized water exposed to sunlight on a sunny day in Champaign, IL were <4 minutes(2). The photolysis half-life of hexachlorocyclopentadiene at 100 mg/L was measured in aqueous buffered solutions at pH 5, 7.4, 9, and 11 and in solutions containing the sensitizer riboflavin(3). Direct photolysis occurred rapidly with a half-life of about 100 minutes, but sensitized photolysis occurred even more rapidly with a half-life of about 47 minutes for solutions in which 5 mg/L riboflavin was added(3).",

Strong absorption of UV light and observed rapid photolysis in aqueous solution suggest that direct photolysis would probably be the dominant removal process in the atmosphere and on soil surfaces. Hexachlorocyclopentadiene adsorbed onto silica gel, underwent 46.0% photomineralization when irradiated with UV light (>290 nm) for 17 hours(2). These data indicate that hexachlorocyclopentadiene adsorbed onto sunlight-exposed particles (e.g. dust, soil surfaces) may be subject to rapid photodegradation(SRC). The rate constant for the reaction of hexachlorocyclopentadiene vapor with photochemically generated hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere has been estimated to be 3.9X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(3). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 29 days assuming an average ambient hydroxyl radical concentration of 5X10+5 molecules/cu cm(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that hexachlorocyclopentadiene is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces; however, adsorption may attenuate this process(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 2 hours if adsorption is ignored(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 7 days if adsorption is ignored(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 37 days when adsorption is considered(3). Losses of hexachlorocyclopentadiene (initial conc 0.41 mg/L), from half-full glass-stoppered and unstoppered bottles shaken at room temperature over a 24 hour period were equivalent to 15-16% of the original amount(4). Loss was presumably due to volatilization(4). Volatilization losses of 5.3-9.9% were observed over a two hr period from a static aqueous solution of hexachlorocyclopentadiene at an initial concentration of 50 ng/L at 25 \u00b0C(5). Hexachlorocyclopentadiene's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur; however, adsorption may attenuate volatilization(2). Hexachlorocyclopentadiene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.060 mm Hg(6). Volatilization losses of 0.84-1.60% from moist sand, 0.35-0.67% from moist loam, and 0.15-0.285% from moist humus were observed over a two hour period in a laboratory study, carried out at 25 \u00b0C, where the initial hexachlorocyclopentadiene concentration was 50 ug/kg soil on a dry weight basis(5). Following application of 100 mg of radiolabeled hexachlorocyclopentadiene to a moist Maury silt loam, the cumulative evaporative losses of this compound and its nonpolar metabolites (penta- and tetrachlorocylopentadiene) 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after application were 9.3, 10.2, 10.6, 10.8, 11.0, and 11.2%, respectively(4).",

Hexachlorobicycloheptadiene was detected more frequently in urine from these workers than in urine from workers at another municipal wastewater treatment plant in the same city. Urine concn of hexachlorobicycloheptadiene were higher in specimens collected late in the work shift. The primary route of exposure was probably inhalation. This was the 1st known report of these compounds being detected in human urine and it demonstrated the potential for wastewater treatment plant worker exposure to industrial wastes.",

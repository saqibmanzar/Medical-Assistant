They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

                                "Description": "Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPGs) are air concentration guidelines for single exposures to agents, developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The compounds were diethylenetriamine in high purity and commercial samples, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, and a residue mixture of ten carbon and higher polymeric amines, polyamine-HPA-No-2. Groups of 50 C3H/HeJ mice were treated on their backs, three times a week for their complete life span, with applications of 25 ul of one of the substances. Hair was clipped from the treatment areas once a week. Approximate doses were 1.25 mg for high purity diethylenetriamie, commercial diethylenetriamine, and triethylenetetramine, 6.25 mg for tetraethylenepentamine, and 2.5 mg for HPA-No-2. Mean survival time was 587 to 662 days for the five groups of treated mice and 626 days for water treated controls. No epidermal tumors were seen except for a papilloma on the upper lip of one mouse in the triethylenetetramine group, but this was not considered to be treatment related because of its location. Three other cutaneous or subcutaneous neoplasms (two in treated groups, one in the control group) were considered to be spontaneous. Twenty cases of hyperkeratosis and 13 of epidermal necrosis were observed in the tetraethylenepentamine group, indicating that tetraethylenepentamine induced irritation, but there was no epidermal hyperplasia or dermal fibrosis. Absence of irritation in the other groups probably resulted from the lower doses used. It was concluded that there is no evidence of an oncogenic effect of any member of the tested series of ethyleneamines under the conditions studied.",

If released to soil, tetraethylenepentamine is expected to leach (estimated Koc of 3.6); it will exist primarily as a cation under environmental conditions (pH 5-9) and no experimental data are available which suggest whether the cation will adsorb to soil more strongly than its estimated Koc value indicates. No data were located which suggest biodegradation is an important fate process of tetraethylenepentamine in soil or water. If released to water, tetraethylenepentamine may hydrolyze; however, no experimental data were located. Its complete water solubility suggests that it may be susceptible to long distance transport in aquatic environments. Volatilization, adsorption to sediment and bioconcentration in aquatic organisms are not expected to be environmentally important removal processes in aquatic systems. If released to the atmosphere, tetraethylenepentamine is expected to exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase tetraethylenepentamine is expected to degrade rapidly by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of 1.2 hrs). Particulate phase tetraethylenepentamine may be susceptible to dry deposition. Also, based on its complete water solubility, removal from air via wet deposition may occur. In occupational settings, exposure of tetraethylenepentamine may occur through eye and skin contact. (SRC)",

An estimated Koc of 3.6 and BCF of 4.2 suggest that adsorption to sediment and bioconcentration in aquatic organisms may not be important fate processes for tetraethylenepentamine in water systems(1). Based on pKa1, pKa2, pKa3, pKa4, and pKa5 values of 9.68, 9.10, 8.08, 4.72, and 2.98(3), respectively, tetraethylenepentamine will exist primarily as a cation under environmental conditions (pH 5-9). However, no experimental data are available which suggest whether it will adsorb to sediment more strongly than its estimated Koc value indicates. Amines are potentially susceptible to hydrolysis(4). Therefore, tetraethylenepentamine may hydrolyze in aquatic environments, but no rates were located(SRC). Furthermore, no data were located which suggest biodegradation is an important environmental fate process of tetraethylenepentamine in aquatic systems(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

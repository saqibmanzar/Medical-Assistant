They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Natural gas plant production of propane primarily involves extracting materials such as propane and butane from natural gas to prevent these liquids from condensing and causing operational problems in natural gas pipelines. Similarly, when oil refineries make major products such as motor gasoline and heating oil, some propane is produced as a by-product of those processes. It is important to understand that the by-product nature of propane production means that the volume made available from natural gas processing and oil refining cannot be adjusted when prices and/or demand for propane fluctuate.",

Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. CAUTION: For LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972), DO NOT apply water, regular or alcohol-resistant foam directly on spill. Use a high-expansion foam if available to reduce vapors. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2024)",

Vapors are generally recondensed by refrigeration and returned to the tanks. 3) In frozen earth storage of propane, the walls and bottom of a pit in the ground are frozen and a dome is constructed over the pit. The pressure in the storage cavern is maintained @ nearly atmospheric pressure by refrigeration systems that cool the product to its boiling point @ storage pressure. Heat leaks into the cavity and vaporizes some of the propane; the vapor that is formed is compressed, cooled, and returned to the pit as liquid by the refrigeration system. ... 4) Underground storage caverns, which operate @ approx formation temp and @ the corresponding /liquified petrolem gas (LPG)/ vapor pressure ... must be of sufficient depth to develop an overburden pressure greater than the vapor pressure of the stored liquid.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957), Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) and Methane (UN1971) are lighter than air and will rise.  Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket.",

The blast occurred less than half an hour after an all-terrain vehicle (ATV), driven by a minor without the owner's permission, damaged two above-ground propane pipes and a fire resulting from that accident engulfed the tank. The explosion that occurred at the farm is known as a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion or BLEVE. Tank fragments produced by the BLEVE killed two volunteer fire fighters. In addition, seven other emergency response personnel were injured, and several buildings were damaged by the blast. ... The propane storage and handling system was installed at the farm in 1988. When the tank system was installed, Iowa law provided that the 1979 edition of the National Fire Protection Association's Standard for the Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases (NFPA 58) governed the installation. ... The propane system at the farm did not comply with NFPA 58 in two significant respects that contributed to the incident: Above ground piping was not protected from potential damage from vehicles, and the liquid propane outlet pipe downstream from an excess flow valve was too narrow in diameter. Fire fighter training for responding to BLEVEs was /also/ inadequate. Some training materials provided to the fire fighters led them to believe that they would be protected from a propane tank explosion by positioning themselves to the sides of the tank and by avoiding the areas extending from the two ends of the tank. As a consequence, fire fighters were positioned too close to the sides of the burning propane storage tank when it exploded. ... A contributing cause /was that/ ... the State Fire Marshal should have received a plan of the farm's propane system prior to its installation in 1988. The State Fire Marshal had no record of the farm's system, however. Iowa law did not specifically designate which party -- the owner or the installer of a large propane tank facility -- was required to notify the State Fire Marshal. In addition, the State Fire Marshal did not have a program in place to adequately monitor or inspect large propane storage facilities.",

The effects of propane /were studied/ in guinea pigs exposed to 24,000-29,000 ppm and 47,000-55,000 ppm propane for periods of 5, 30, 60, and 120 min; at the lower concn, irregular breathing was observed and at the higher concn, tremors were evident during the first 5 min of exposure. Stupor was commonly observed in the animals exposed for longer periods of time (up to 2 hr). All animals recovered from the propane exposure and there were no pathological signs of organ toxicity at necropsy. In these studies, a /CNS depressant/ ... effect for propane was not seen until exposure levels were about 50,000 ppm. In contrast, /other studies showed/ n-butane caused anesthesia in mice within 1 min at 22,000 ppm and caused death in dogs at 20,000-25,000 ppm. Therefore, propane is much less toxic than its next higher homolog, n-butane.[Snyder, R. (ed.) Ethel Browning's Toxicity and Metabolism of Industrial Solvents. 2nd ed. Volume 1: Hydrocarbons.

Combustion of polyethylene and gasoline, waste incinerators as well as disposal of products associated with the petroleum and natural gas industries may also contribute to its release into the environment. Propane is a component of natural gas and crude petroleum. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7,150 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase propane will be degraded in the atmosphere by a reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days. Propane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, propane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 460. Propane is readily degraded by soil bacterium; within 24 hr propane was oxidized to acetone. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.07X10-1 atm-cu m/mole. Propane will volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, propane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation in water is not expected to be an important environmental fate process; after 192 hr, the trace concentrations of propane contained in gasoline remained unchanged for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 41 min and 2.6 hours, respectively. An estimated BCF of 13 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to propane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propane is produced or used. Propane is widely detected in air. The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to propane is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from natural gas and crude oil emissions. Monitoring data also indicate that the general population may be exposed to propane via ingestion of food and drinking water, although these pathways are considered minor when compared to inhalation.

Volatilization of propane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.07X10-1 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 7150 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 62.4 mg/L(5). Propane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). Using cell suspensions of microogranisms isolated from soil and water, propane was oxidized to acetone within 24 hours(6,7), suggesting that biodegradation may be an important fate process in soil and sediment.",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.07X10-1 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 7150 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 62.4 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 41 minutes and 2.6 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 13.1(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). After 192 hr, the trace concn of propane contained in gasoline remained unchanged for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline(8). This indicates that biodegradation may not be an important fate process in water.",

Gas-phase propane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.15X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Propane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(4).",

The terminal methyl group is enzymatically oxidized by incorporation of a molecular oxygen by a monooxygenase producing a primary alcohol with further oxidation to an acid group, although involvement of a dioxygenase is also postulated. Once the fatty acid is produced, it is degraded into 2-carbon units via the beta-oxidation pathway. ... Another pathway for n-alkane degradation that is encountered less often is the oxidation of both terminal carbons to form a dioic acid with subsequent beta-oxidation. Subterminal oxidation of the 2-carbon atom is seen mainly in C3-C6 alkanes. ... A dehydrogenation of the n-alkane may also occur yielding an alkene which is then converted to an alcohol, although there is little evidence for this theory. Some microorganisms have been shown to have both terminal and subterminal oxidation, each having different rates of activity. /In a study comparing/ ... growth on long and short chain alkanes by some bacteria ... the initial oxidase had a broad specificity and would oxidize C1-C8 alkanes. ... /n-Alkanes/",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 41 minutes(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 2.6 days(SRC). Propane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

Propane was found in the Cassiar tunnel in Vancouver, BC, Canada in 1993 and 1995 at mass fractions of 0.81 and 0.047, respectively, as well as Tuscorora, Caldecott and Fort McHenry tunnels at mass fractions of 0.08, 0.07 and 0.03, respectively(3). Propane accounted for 0.88, 0.95 and 1.17% of the emissions on a Raleigh, NC highway, Dyanomenter, and an Atlanta, GA roadway, respectively(4). Gasoline containing propane (100 ug/g) emitted propane from the tail pipes of catalytic and non catalytic engines at rates of 650 and 9,300 ug/km(5). Propane emissions from cars driving in urban, suburban, rural and motorways were observed as 7.8, 3.69, 2.13 and 1.35 mg/km(6). Propane concentration in exhaust had mean concentration of 0.21 ppm(7). Propane was detected with annual means of 1 ug/cu m in London, England background and curbside and annual mean ranging from 4-21 ug/cu m in European cities(7). Propane was detected in gasoline vapors at concentrations ranging from 0.02-2.8 mg/ cu m(8).",

Occupational exposure to propane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propane is produced or used. Propane is widely detected in air(SRC). The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to propane is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from natural gas, natural gas food grills, and crude oil emissions. Monitoring data also indicate that the general population may be exposed to propane via ingestion of food and drinking water, although these pathways are considered minor when compared to inhalation(SRC).",

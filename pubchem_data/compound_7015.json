When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Mean body weights of high-dose rats of both sexes and of low-dose male rats were slightly lower than those of controls. No significant differences in survival times were observed between dosed and control groups. In dosed male rats there was a compound-related increased incidence of kidneys with inflammatory cells and interstitial fibrosis. No tumors in dosed rats were associated with the chemical. Mean body weights of high-dose male mice were slightly lower than those of controls, and survival of high-dose male mice was also significantly (P<0.01) reduced relative to controls. Hemangiosarcoma of the circulatory system occurred in female mice with a statistically significant (P<0.001) positive trend. The observed incidences of hemangiosarcoma were 0/49 (0%), 1/50 (2%), and 7/50 (14%) in controls, low- and high-dose groups, respectively. In individual group comparisons, the incidence in the high-dose group was significantly (P<0.01) higher than that in the controls. The hemangiosarcoma seen in female mice were quite rare with only 6/816 (0.7%) previously seen in controls at the same laboratory and no more than 3 in any group of 50. Hemangiosarcoma also occurred in male mice with a statistically significant positive trend (P=0.04 by a life table test), with incidences of 0/50 (0%), 2/50 (4%), and 3/50 (6%), in control, low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively. The development of hemangiosarcoma in the high-dose male mice might have been curtailed by the significantly reduced survival time in this group.",

ATP formation and O2 uptake were measured. In the in vitro experiments the carcinogens were added to incubation media containing liver mitochondria isolated from normal rats. With 2-aminobiphenyl, ATP formation and O2 uptake decreased as compared with the control group using succinate as substrate. No noticeable changes in ATP formation or O2 uptake were observed with glutamate as substrate. With benzo-alpha-pyrene, O2 uptake decreased when succinate was used as substrate, but increased if glutamate was the substrate.

                                                    "String": "2-Biphenylamine's production and use in research and analytical chemistry may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.2X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-biphenylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-biphenylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours. If released to soil, 2-biphenylamine is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 836. Aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that 2-biphenylamine may be immobile in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Biphenylamine was shown to be non-toxic using a pure culture of Tetrahymena pyriformis, relative to other mono alkyl-or halogen substituted anilines and utilized to some extent by Escherchia coli strain. If released into water, 2-biphenylamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 30.68 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to 2-biphenylamine may occur via inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-biphenylamine is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

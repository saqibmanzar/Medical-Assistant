Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The relative volume of distribution, app. VD, was determined at 298 mL, indicating distribution over the whole body. After oral doses of 1, 5, and 10 mL (14)C-DEG/kg 64, 87, and 91% of (14)C activity in rat blood disappeared in 12-16 hr with a half-life of 3.4 hr and the remaining 9, 5, and 4% with half-lives of 39 hr, 45 hr, and 49 hr. A total of 73-96% of (14)C activity in blood was excreted with the urine and 0.7-2.2% with the feces. From the cumulative urinary excretion kinetics half-lives of 6 hr were determined for doses of 1 and 5 mL/kg and 10 hr for the dose of 10 mL/kg. After doses of 5 mL/kg and 10 mL/kg (14)C-DEG semi-logarithmic plots of elimination rate versus time were constant for 5 and 9 hr, respectively, indicating that DEG accelerated its renal elimination by inducing osmotic diuresis. Thereafter urinary excretion followed first order kinetics with elimination half-lives of 3.6 hr. After oral doses of 5 ml/kg (14)C-DEG given to rats of 336 g body weight with an app. VD of 297 mL, the total clearance of (14)C activity was determined at 63 mL/hr, and the renal clearance of unmetabolized DEG was 66 mL/hr. The ratio of ClDEG to Cl (inulin)  = 0.64 indicated that DEG and its metabolite 2-hydroxyethoxyacetate (2-HEAA) were reabsorbed from the tubuli into the blood capillaries.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Further information was obtained from house visits and community surveys; blood and stool samples were collected from other ill children, healthy family members and community contacts. Samples of drinking-water and water from a tube-well were tested for coliform organisms. Most of the children (26/36) were from the Gurgaon district in Haryana or had visited Gurgaon town for treatment of a minor illness. Acute renal failure developed after an episode of acute febrile illness with or without watery diarrhea or mild respiratory symptoms for which the children had been treated with unknown medicines by private medical practitioners. On admission to hospital the children were not dehydrated. Median blood urea concentration was 150 mg/dL (range 79-311 mg/dL) and median serum creatinine concentration was 5.6 mg/dL (range 2.6-10.8 mg/dL). Kidney biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis. Thirty-three children were known to have died despite being treated with peritoneal dialysis and supportive therapy. Cough expectorant manufactured by a company in Gurgaon was found to be contaminated with diethylene glycol (17.5% v/v)... . Thus, poisoning with diethylene glycol seems to be the cause of acute renal failure in these children.",

The animals dosed with ethylene glycol demonstrated significantly higher oxalate levels, particularly at 8 hr post-dosing, than similar animals dosed with diethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol induced oxalate deposition within the kidney without significant histologic changes. Diethylene glycol induced histologic changes within the kidneys without kidney oxalate deposition. Maximal kidney oxalate levels, following ethylene glycol dosage, occurred concurrently with peak blood oxalate concentrations. In the case of diethylene glycol, kidney oxalate levels did not peak until 4 hr after maximal blood oxalate levels. Ethylene and diethylene glycol induced different modes of death in Sprague-Dawley rats.",

It was part of a large structure-activity series of glycol ethers & congeners evaluated using this design. F0 mice were exposed to drinking water containing 0.0, 0.35%, 1.75%, & 3.5% diethylene glycol. Based on water consumption data collected during the study, these concns produced calculated \u00b0Consumptions of nearly equal to 612, 3062, & 6,125 mg/kg/d. While F0 body weight was unchanged by diethylene glycol consumption during the Task 2 mating period, the number of litters/pair was reduced by 12% at the top dose, & the number of live pups/litter was reduced by 32%. Pup weight adjusted for litter size was reduced by nearly equal to 12% at the top dose level. In a crossover mating to determine the affected sex, number of pups/litter was equivalent across the three groups, but adjusted pup weight was reduced by 10% in the control male x 3.5% diethylene glycol female mating. After the F1 mice were weaned, the control & 3.5% diethylene glycol F0 mice were killed & necropsied. There were no treatment-related changes in male organ weights or histopathology, while female body weight was reduced by 7% after 3.5% diethylene glycol consumption. Adjusted organ weights were unchanged. For the F1 mating trial, exposed mice from the 1.75% group were used, because insufficient mice were available from the top dose, due to reduced fertility in that group. Diethylene glycol at 1.75% did not affect pup survival to mating at /postnatal day/ 74. There were no treatment-related alterations in the number or weight of F2 pups in the Task 4 mating trial. After all the F2 litters were born & the F1 females subjected to estrous cyclicity evaluation, the F1 mice were killed & necropsied. There was an 11% & 7% decr in the body weights of the treated males & females, respectively. No organ weights were affected, nor were sperm indices changed. In summary, diethylene glycol at 3.5% was a reproductive toxicant in Swiss mice, based on reductions in litters/pair, & in mean litter size. In F0 mice, this was unaccompanied by body weight loss, while in F1 mice, there was reduced body weight in the absence of a fertility effect.",

Diethylene glycol (DEG, CAS No. 111-46-6) was administered by gavage to timed-pregnant Swiss (CD-1) mice (26-31 per group) on gestational days (GD) 6-15 at dose levels of 0, 1250, 5000, or 10,000 mg/kg body weight/day. Animals were observed daily for clinical signs of toxicity. Food and water consumption and body weights were determined on gestational days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 17. All animals were killed on gestational days 17 and examined for maternal body and organ weights, implant status, fetal weight, sex, and morphological development. ... Relative (g/kg body weight/day) water intake was significantly increased over control for every interval starting at gestational days 6 in the 5000 and 10,000 mg/kg/day diethylene glycol treated animals. Maternal animals given 10,000 mg/kg/day of diethylene glycol had significantly decreased relative (g/kg body weight/day) food consumption from gestational days 6 to 12. One maternal animal treated with 10,000 mg/kg/day of diethylene glycol was sacrificed in extremis on gd 10. Necropsy and histopathologic examinations revealed evidence of renal degeneration and suggested that morbidity was due to toxicity produced by diethylene glycol. Necropsy of maternal animals on gestational days 17 showed that animals from the 5000 and 10,000 mg/kg/day DEG groups had significantly increased absolute (g) and relative (% body weight) kidney weights when compared to control animals. At 10,000 mg/kg/day , renal lesions (renal tubular degeneraion) were noted in 2/27 females which survived to scheduled 11% (3/28) of the pregnant females at the high dose showed evidence of renal pathology as compared to 0/20 pregnant females from the vehicle control group. No effects of diethylene glycol were observed on pre- or post-implantation loss. The mean fetal body weight per dose group on gestational days 17 was associated with a significant decreasing linear trend (99%, 96%, and 85% of control from the low to high dose) and mean fetal body weight was significantly decreased in the highdose group (0.865 g) when compared to controls (1.012 g). Examination of the fetuses for external, visceral and skeletal malformations did not reveal any significant effects between dose groups. The decrease in fetal body weight indicated developmental toxicity at the 10,000 mg/kg/day exposure level of diethylene glycol. In summary, there was no maternal or developmental toxicity at 1250 mg/kg/day of diethylene glycol. The mid-dose (5000 mg/kg/day diethylene glycol) produced significant maternal toxicity, but no clear evidence of developmental toxicity. The high dose (10,000 mg/kg/day diethylene glycol) caused the death of I out of 28 pregnant dams, maternal toxicity and developmental toxicity.",

Major airports have a number of hydrocarbon-based contaminants that could appear in storm-water runoff. In addition, ethylene, diethylene, and propylene glycol deicing and anti-icing mixtures are used during freezing and near-freezing weather. The objective of this study was to characterize the potential acute impact on aquatic life from industrial storm-water discharges from an international airport. Samples from winter storm events caused acute toxicity to both the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) and the daphnid (Daphnia magna), with LC50 values for both species as low as 1.0 to 2.0% effluent. The toxicity of the samples was due to the various glycol-based deicer/anti-icer mixtures used during these events. High oxygen demands and elevated total nitrogen levels are other potential problems during anti-icing/deicing activities. Samples from rain events during the nonwinter months at the airport did not cause acute toxicity unless associated with fuel spills. As a result of this study, a new discharge permit has been issued for this airport, requiring the implementation of plans for the collection and recycling and/or disposal of the deicer /anti-icer mixtures.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.7X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diethylene glycol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diethylene glycol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hrs. Diethylene glycol degraded 5.5% by light at a wavelength greater than 290 nm over a period of 17 hours and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diethylene glycol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Diethylene glycol may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Diethylene glycol was readily biodegraded in a sandy loam suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, diethylene glycol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Diethylene glycol will be removed partially or completely from river water within 7 days at 20 \u00b0C, but for winter conditions of river flow and temperature (less than 8 \u00b0C), degradation will be minimal. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to diethylene glycol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diethylene glycol is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to diethylene glycol via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing diethylene glycol. (SRC)",

Biodegradation of diethylene glycol in a series of different biodegradation tests is as follows: 53% removal using the coupled units test; 94% DOC removal in the Zahn-Wellens test; 42% DOC removal in the OECD screening test; 80% BODT after 30 days in the closed bottle test; 33% DOC removal in the Sturm test; and 59% DOC removal in the AFNOR test(2). Diethylene glycol was 100% biodegraded using the Zahn-Wellens test which measures inherent biodegradability; employing the Husmann simulation test, biodegradation was 88% and 52% using using domestic sewage and artificial seed as per OECD guidelines, respectively(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It is based on: (1) the TF-IDF, adapted to chemical structures, (2) location information in the text (e.g. title, abstract, keywords), and (3) the document size.  Springer Nature aims to provide only highly qualitative and relevant content but references of lower relevance aren't withheld as they might contain also very useful information.",

Systemic effects appear within minutes after inhalation of vapors or aerosols. In contrast, the onset of symptoms is delayed after gastrointestinal and percutaneous absorption.

Compounds were administered to mice subcutaneously in acute toxicity tests, topically for detection of miosis, and intracerebrally to test for the induction of tremors. Dimefox, the compound with the greatest acute subcutaneous toxicity, produced neither miosis nor tremor, whereas both phosdrin and dichlorvos did produce both.",

However, dimefox is not currently (2005) registered for use as a pesticide in the US.  If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.11 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates dimefox will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dimefox will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.0 hours. Dimefox does not contain chromophores that absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dimefox is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2.2. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, dimefox is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Dimefox may hydrolyze in aquatic environments, based on a half-life of 8.8 days measured in an ethanol/buffer solution (20:80) at pH 6.0 and 70 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to dimefox may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimefox is produced or used, although it is presently not registered in the US.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

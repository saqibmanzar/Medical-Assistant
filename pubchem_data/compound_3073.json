A chemical by-product is a chemical that is formed while making another substance. Sarin was produced and stored only in the Rocky Mountain Arsenal outside of Denver, Colorado. Production of Sarin in the United States was discontinued in 1957. Diisopropyl methylphosphonate is not known to occur naturally in the environment. It is not likely to be produced in the United States in the future because of the signing of a chemical treaty that bans the use, production, and stockpiling of poison gases. Diisopropyl methylphosphonate is a colorless liquid. Other names for it are DIMP, diisopropyl methane-phosphonate, phosphonic acid, and methyl-bis-(1-methylethyl)ester.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

In both male and female mink and rats, diisopropyl methylphosphonate was rapidly absorbed after oral administration; it was metabolized by a saturable pathway to a single metabolite, isopropyl methylphosphonate (IMPA), which was rapidly excreted, primarily in the urine (90%). Fecal radioactivity, also identified as isopropyl methylphosphonate, was 1.7-3.1% of the administered dose. Female rats had a slower rate of conversion of diisopropyl methylphosphonate to isopropyl methylphosphonate and less total excretion of isopropyl methylphosphonate than male rats. Metabolism of diisopropyl methylphosphonate administered intravenously was not very different from that given orally in both species. These data indicate that mink absorb, metabolize, and excrete diisopropyl methylphosphonate (as IMPA) in a manner very similar to mice, rats, and dogs.",

A chemical by-product is a chemical that is formed while making another substance. Sarin was produced and stored only in the Rocky Mountain Arsenal outside of Denver, Colorado. Production of Sarin in the United States was discontinued in 1957. Diisopropyl methylphosphonate is not known to occur naturally in the environment. It is not likely to be produced in the United States in the future because of the signing of a chemical treaty that bans the use, production, and stockpiling of poison gases. Diisopropyl methylphosphonate is a colorless liquid. Other names for it are DIMP, diisopropyl methane-phosphonate, phosphonic acid, and methyl-bis-(1-methylethyl)ester.",

Emergency groups as well as citizens in surrounding communities need to know the relative effectiveness of various chemical protective clothing (CPC) ensembles in the unlikely event of such releases. A method has beeen developed for studying permeation of chemical warfare agent simulants through chemical protective clothing materials. The experimental results characterize some commercially available chemical protective clothing materials. Thirteen different chemical protective clothing materials having widely differing compositions were chosen to study the permeation of four different liquid chemical warfare simulants (dimethyl methyl phosphonate, diisopropyl methyl phosphonate, malathion, and dibutyl sulfide) through these chemical protective clothing materials at 25 \u00b0C. This permeation study involved a newly developed analytical technique employing room temperature fluorescence quenching of an indicator compound, phenanthrene, on filter paper. Various experimental factors such as breakthrough time, rate of permeation and uptake were investigated. on the basis of breakthrough time, the 13 chemical protective clothing materials could be divided into three groups: most resistant, moderately resistant, and least resistant. Materials in the most resistant category exhibited no permeation by any of the simulants for at least 24 hours. Breakthrough occurred in the least resistant materials in generally less than an hour, and sometimes as soon as a few minutes.",

The frequency of sister chromatid exchanges was significantly higher in the victims than in the control group. Analyzing results using samples of urine from the victims suggested that the victims were exposed to not only sarin per se, but by-products of sarin synthesis, i.e. diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP), diethyl methylphosphonate (DEMP) and ethyl isopropyl methylphosphonate (EIMP).

A significantly lower percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood was also noted in mink after ingestion of 2, 201, or 1,852 mg/kg/day in the diet for 21 days. Mink that received food containing the compound at 17 mg/kg/day did not demonstrate a change in lymphocytes. The decreased hematocrit probably resulted from RBC damage and subsequent RBC clearance. This would explain the increase in reticulocytes and Heinz bodies noted in other studies. Increased hematocrit was noted in male dark variety mink treated with 37 or 95 mg/kg/day diisopropyl methylphosphonate in feed for 49 weeks, but not in males treated with I I mg/kg/day or in females in any of the treatment groups. No differences in hemoglobin concentration or mean corpuscular hemoglobin were noted in either se in any of the treatment groups ... .",

It is a byproduct in the production of the chemical agent sarin (GB), constituting up to 20% of the chemical agent, and may also be used to simulate G-type chemical agents, and may be released to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.28 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diisopropyl methylphosphonate will exist solely in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase diisopropyl methylphosphonate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hrs. Diisopropyl methylphosphonate does not absorb radiation >290 nm; therefore, direct photolysis cannot occur. If released to soil, diisopropyl methylphosphonate is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 87. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Diisopropyl methylphosphonate volatilization from dry soil surfaces is expected to be slow based upon its vapor pressure. One volatilization study indicated that 5% and 22% of diisopropyl methylphosphonate applied to dry and moist soil, respectively, volatilized in 10 days. Biodegradation in soil is extremely slow; reported half-lives are 1 and 3 years, for acclimated and unacclimated soil, respectively. If released into water, diisopropyl methylphosphonate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 31 hours and 13 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 1.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Diisopropyl methylphosphonate does hydrolyze, primarily by a base-catalyzed reaction resulting in isopropanol and isopropyl methylphosphonate. However, this hydrolysis is very slow and will not be important at environmental pHs and temperatures. Occupational exposure to diisopropyl methylphosphonate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at military workplaces where diisopropyl methylphosphonate is produced or used.

Volatilization of diisopropyl methylphosphonate from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.28 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 1.5X10+3 mg/l(5). One volatilization study indicated that 5% and 22% of diisopropyl methylphosphonate applied to dry and moist soil, respectively, volatilized in 10 days(4). Biodegradation in soil is extremely slow; reported half-lives are 1 and 3 years, for acclimated and unacclimated soil, respectively(6). When 1 mg samples of sarin (GB) (containing diisopropyl methylphosphonate as an impurity) were placed on a snow surface and analyzed for persistence after 2 and 4 weeks, the diisopropyl methylphosphonate in the samples were in the range of 10-100% of the initial concns at both sampling periods(7). Diisopropyl methylphosphonate deposited on soil and maintained in an environmental chamber at 25 \u00b0C under tungsten light had an half-life of 26 to 28 days(4). The most likely process responsible for the loss of diisopropyl methylphosphonate is volatilization(4). The half-lives after deposition on foliar surfaces under 65% full sunlight, as opposed to tungsten light, was 4.2 days and 3.6 days for tall fescue grass and short-needle pine, respectively(8). The decreased half-life in grass versus soil may have resulted from increased volatilization due to increased surface area of grass compared with soil or the contribution of an enzymatically-mediated degradative process(8).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.28 mm Hg(7), and water solubility, 1.5X10+3 mg/l(7). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 31 hrs and 13 days, respectively(SRC). Diisopropyl methylphosphonate does hydrolyze, primarily by a base-catalyzed reaction resulting in isopropanol and isopropyl methylphosophonate(4). Using data from two studies(4,9) and extrapolation(SRC), hydrolysis is very slow and will not be important at environmental pHs and temperatures. One study indicated that biodegradation did not occur in natural water during a 12 week period(8). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 1.2(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.",

Vapor-phase diisopropyl methylphosphonate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3) determined using a structure estimation method(3). Diisopropyl methylphosphonate does not absorb radiation >290 nm; therefore, direct photolysis cannot occur(4). Indirect photolysis is insignificant in regard to diisopropyl methylphosphonate's environmental fate in Rocky Mountain Arsenal water; diisopropyl methylphosphonate did not photolyze in either distilled or Rocky Mountain Arsenal water, when exposed to light (>290 nm) for 232 hours (9.7 days)(5).",

When diisopropyl methylphosphonate was incubated in soil at 25 degC, slow biodegradation occurred as was evidenced by the evolution of 14-CO2(1). Approximately 1.5% and 5% of the carbon was released as CO2 after 17 weeks in unacclimated and acclimated soil, respectively. The rate limiting step is the enzymatic hydrolysis of diisopropyl methylphosphonate to isopropyl methylphosphonic acid. The estimated half-lives are 1 and 3 years in acclimated and unacclimated soil, respectively(1). When the soil temperature was reduced to 10 degC, no biodegradation was observed. Another soil sample released 13.4% of its original activity as CO2 after 34 weeks of incubation, indicating a half-life of 2 years(1).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Diisopropyl methylphosphonate is a weak UV absorber with absorption bands at 200 and 250 nm; the absorptivity is less than 0.1 L/mole-cm at 250 nm(2). There is no absorption >290 nm; therefore, direct photolysis cannot occur. Earlier studies showing an absorption tail extending into the near UV-visible region(3) were in error. Diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP) did not photolyze in either distilled or Rocky Mountain Arsenal water, when exposed to light (>290 nm) for 232 hours (9.7 days)(3). Thus, indirect photolysis is insignificant in regard to diisopropyl methylphosphonate's environmental fate in Rocky Mountain Arsenal water. Hydrolysis of diisopropyl methylphosphonate is extremely slow. Extrapolations from rate measurements at elevated temperatures indicate a hydrolytic half-life of 663,000 years at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C(4). The hydrolysis products are isopropanol and the half ester(4). The basic and acid rate constants extrapolated to 25 \u00b0C are 3.2X10-7 and 6.4X10-9 l/mole-sec, respectively(4). Another investigator obtained hydrolysis rate constants for diisopropyl methylphosphonate in water at 98 \u00b0C, 90 \u00b0C, and 80 \u00b0C of 2.0X10-6, 0.88X10-6, and 0.31X10-6 sec-1, respectively(5). The activation energy and ln A derived from these data are 26.9 and 10.17 kcal/mole, respectively. The half-life is 26 days at 80 \u00b0C. Extrapolation to 25 \u00b0C yields a half-life of 79 yrs(SRC). While these half-lives are very different, both indicate that hydrolysis will not be a significant loss process(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

A 13% reduction in diisopropyl methylphosphonate concn occurred when diisopropyl methylphosphonate-containing medium was circulated for 32 days in a soil percolator to acclimate the soil microorganisms(5). The investigators speculated that adsorption, rather than biodegradation, was responsible for the diisopropyl methylphosphonate reduction because no further diisopropyl methylphosphonate loss occurred during an additional 18 weeks of operation(5). The mobility of diisopropyl methylphosphonate in soil is evidenced by the detection of diisopropyl methylphosphonate in groundwater at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal(4,6).

This Henry's Law constant indicates that diisopropyl methylphosphonate is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 31 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 13 days(SRC). Diisopropyl methylphosphonate's estimated Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Diisopropyl methylphosphonate is expected to volatilize slowly from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.28 mm Hg(1). In a study of the volatilization of diisopropyl methylphosphonate from soil, 20 ppm of radiolabeled diisopropyl methylphosphonate was mixed with dry or moist soil in 4 inch deep columns and air was directed across the soil surface(3). After approximately 250 hours (10.4 days), the dry soil retained 95% of the initial radioactivity while the moist soil retained 78%(3). During a soil biodegradation test, 19% of the 14-C-diisopropyl methylphosphonate volatilized from the soil biometer test during the 34 weeks of incubation(4). When diisopropyl methylphosphonate was applied to corn and sugarbeet leaves, 96-97% and 91% volatilized within 24 hr, respectively(5).",

Diisopropyl methylphosphonate concns in groundwater at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal ranged from 0.5 ppb, the analytical detection limit, to 44,000 ppb near an abandoned waste-disposal pond(2). The pond received effluent between 1952 and 1956. When the measurements were made in 1974, groundwater contamination covered 73 sq km, spreading beyond the boundaries of the Arsenal. The concn of diisopropyl methylphosphonate measured in water in the North Bog of the arsenal in January 1979 was 0.26 - 0.27 ppm(3). Isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA) can disproportionate on a GC column to form diisopropyl methylphosphonate and methylphosphonic acid (MPA)(4). Therefore, the detection of diisopropyl methylphosphonate may be an artifact of the analytical system, unless IMPA is removed during sample preparation.",

Sugar beet, carrot, wheat, and bean plants grown both hydroponically and in soil showed slight bioconcentration relative to the growth medium. Wheat leaves (soil grown) had a BCF of 11.0, the highest of all the plants(3). Repeated application of irrigation water contaminated with diisopropyl methylphosphonate may result in the absorption, translocation, and bioconcentration of diisopropyl methylphosphonate in plant tissue(2). When applied to sugar beet leaves, diisopropyl methylphosphonate was absorbed and translocated to all parts of the plant (except new leaves) after 72 hours. However, diisopropyl methylphosphonate did not translocate when applied to corn leaves. The observation that bioconcentration in plants is low may be a result of metabolism, which is known to occur in mammals and birds(1,4).",

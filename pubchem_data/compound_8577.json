They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

The red form is not a distinct polymorph, but a slightly contaminated form of the yellow salt. It has a bitter taste. It is used in explosives, in fireworks and rocket propellants. It is used in pyrotechnics and explosive compositions. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Ammonium picrate can pass through the skin. This chemical is moderately irritating to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. This chemical can irritate the eyes, and skin and is an allergen. Ingestion can cause a bitter taste, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, skin eruptions, stupor, and possible death. Breathing high levels can damage the kidneys, liver, and red blood cells. Urine may become reddish, scant, or even stop; there may be drowsiness, coma, and even death. Long Term Exposure: Repeated exposure can cause the skin and eyes to turn yellow, skin allergy, liver, kidney, and blood cell damage. The most common occupational health problem was dermatitis, which was thought to be due to sensitization and not primary irritation by the picrate. Upper respiratory disease was negligible and systemic toxicity was not recognized among the workers. The cutaneous lesions appeared usually on the exposed parts of the upper extremities. Persons least exposed seemed more liable to acquire dermatitis, which did not develop in those engaged in operations where there was the heaviest exposure. Ammonium picrate can produce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, staining of the skin, dermatitis, circular eruptions of the skin, coma, and seizures. ANIMAL STUDIES: Ammonium picrate was examined for mutagenic activity in a series of in vitro microbial assays employing Salmonella typhimurium and Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicator organisms. The compound was tested over a series of concentration such that there was either quantitative or qualitative evidence of some chemically induced physiological effects at the high dose. The results of the mutagenicity tests were all negative. Ammonium nitrate is harmful to aquatic organisms.",

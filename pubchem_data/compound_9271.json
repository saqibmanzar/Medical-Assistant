PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It also inhibits Na+ K+ ATPase and Ca2+ and Mg2+ ATPase which are essential for the transport of calcium across membranes. This results in the accumulation of intracellular free calcium ions, which promotes release of neurotransmitters from storage vesicles, the subsequent depolarization of adjacent neurons, and the propagation of stimuli throughout the central nervous system. It also causes increased lipid peroxidation, decreased membrane fluidity, and DNA damage in hepatocytes, but the exact mechanism is unknown. (T10, L112)",

The mean concentration of isobenzan in the blood of nine workers at the time of intoxication was 23 ug/L, the range being 17-30 ug/L. Although these workers recovered fully, it took longer than with the related cyclodiene insecticides. In three cases, certain typical complaints, such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and irritability, persisted for 6 months, and the return to normal of the modified EEG pattern sometimes took more than a year. In one case of acute over-exposure, without signs of intoxication, the blood isobenzan concentration decreased from 8 ug/L to <2 ug/L within 3 days. The data from plant workers indicated a threshold level of isobenzan in blood below which no signs or symptoms of intoxication occur. This level was found to be 15 ug/L.",

The dermal LD50 value for the 15% emulsifiable concentrate was 25-35 mg isobenzan/kg bw for Hooded-Lister rats and 6 mg isobenzan/kg bw for New Zealand white rabbits, whereas in the case of the 50% wettable powder the LD50 was 41 mg isobenzan/kg bw for rabbits. Rabbits exposed dermally to the 15% emulsifiable concentrate formulation behaved differently /than/ rats similarly exposed. The rabbits generally lost weight due to anorexia and a failure to drink, and they would then convulse, even as much as 3 weeks after the exposure. However, if feeding and drinking were resumed quickly, the rabbits did not convulse. /Formulated products/",

There was no recovery in the populations of any of the affected groups during the period of up to October 1965. In silt loam plots treated with isobenzan granules (1 kg/ha) in April 1964, the populations of coleoptera, collembola, diptera, mites, and earthworms were all reduced, but to a lesser extent than in the test using 2 kg/ha. Grass grub and hemiptera were not significantly affected,and nematode numbers were elevated 2 yr after treatment.",

The fish were then /placed in/ clean water and observed for an additional 48 hr. The treatment with 1 mg/L caused disorientation and the fish became excited by external stimuli, lost ability to swim, and finally all died within 1 hr. In some cases, they appeared to be convulsive. Isobenzan at 0.1 mg/L caused similar symptoms; within 2 hr of exposure, all five fish died. No fish died at 0.01 mg/L, but slight changes in swimming behavior were observed. When guppies (Poecilia reticulata) were tested in the same way, the symptoms of intoxication and susceptibility were similar to those in Harlequin fish, but the guppies were slower to react.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.92X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isobenzan will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase isobenzan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 28 hours. The vapor-phase isobenzan will also react with ozone with an estimated half-life of 320 days. Particulate-phase isobenzan will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Isobenzan may be susceptible to direct photolysis in the environmental UV spectrum. If released to soil, isobenzan is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4,700. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.9X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation of isobenzan may occur based on soil biodegradation half-lives of 20 to 26 weeks, however it is not expected to be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, isobenzan is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 600 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since similar organochlorine pesticides are not susceptible to hydrolysis. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since isobenzan is no longer produced or used. In the past, isobenzan was applied directly to crops as an insecticide and exposure to this compound was primarily during manufacture and application. (SRC)",

Isobenzan is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based on a vapor pressure of 2.92X10-6 mm Hg(4). Biodegradation in soil is not expected to be an important environmental fate process(SRC). The percentage of isobenzan in soil was shown to decrease with increasing clay content in the soil; no isobenzan was recovered after 4-8 days of exposure at 45 \u00b0C. On the other hand, moist soils showed a diminished ability to degrade isobenzan after 4 days at 45 \u00b0C with the exception of sandy soils(5).

Eight types of soil were used ranging from sand to sandy clay, the percentage of sand varying from 93 to 56% and the percentage of clay from 4 to 35%. Following percolation with hexane, the percentage of isobenzan in the eluate fraction was shown to decrease with increasing content of clay in the soil (starting at about 30% clay). Except in the case of sand with a high organic matter content (6-19%), no isobenzan was recovered from the dry soils after 4-8 days of exposure at 45 \u00b0C. When the soils were moistened with water and exposed at 45 \u00b0C for 4 days, degradation was markedly diminished, with the exception of sand with high organic matter.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

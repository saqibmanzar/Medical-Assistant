The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /CFCs and HCFCs/",

The information in this section includes OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs), American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values (TLVs), and any other exposure limit used or recommended by the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer preparing the safety data sheet, where available. In addition, this section contains information on appropriate engineering controls (e.g., use local exhaust ventilation, or use only in an enclosed system) as well as recommendations for personal protective measures to prevent illness or injury from exposure to chemicals, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., appropriate types of eye, face, skin or respiratory protection needed based on hazards and potential exposure).",

The original Montreal Protocol was agreed on 16 September 1987 and entered into force on 1 January 1989. The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010.

As impressive as these accomplishments are, our work is not done. Even though we have reduced or eliminated the use of many ozone-depleting substances, some still remain. Additionally, since ozone-depleting substances persist in the air for long periods of time, the past use of these substances continues to affect the ozone layer today. We must also continue to ensure that the alternatives being brought to the market support the country's long-term environmental goals in a cost-effective manner.[EPA; Achievements in Stratospheric Ozone Protection Progress Report, Available from, as of March 11, 2013: http://www.epa.gov/ozone/downloads/spd-annual-report_final.pdf]",

A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin & countershock may be effective.

Personal air samples from 2 worker-participants over the course of a typical workshift showed 1.4 ppm chlorodifluoromethane and 2.2 ppm chloropentafluorethane. There were no cases of peripheral neuropathy in the study subjects. There was no significant difference in mean nerve conduction velocities (ulnar, median, peroneal, sural, tibial) between study and reference subjects. Lightheadedness and palpitations were reported significantly more often by refrigeration repair workers (p < 0.05).",

Fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), such as 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane, were scheduled for production phase-out in 1987 by the Montreal Protocol. Although originally scheduled for 50% production phase-out by the year 2000 in developed countries, the worsening ozone depletion has forced acceleration of the CFC phase-out. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1640 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane will exist solely as a gas in the ambient atmosphere. 1,1-Dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane does not contain any groups that react with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals or atmospheric ozone. In addition 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane does not contain any chromophores that absorb solar radiation >290 nm and, therefore, it is not susceptible to direct photolysis in the troposphere. Therefore, 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane will be extremely persistent in the troposphere. In the stratosphere, 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane will slowly photolyze, releasing chlorine atoms which in turn are responsible for removing ozone. Calculated stratospheric lifetimes for other completely halogenated fluorochloroethanes are generally hundreds of years. If released to soil, 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1-Dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane is expected to moderately adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.8 hours and 5.2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 32 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2 atm-cu m/mole, derived from its vapor pressure, 1640 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 137 mg/L(8). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.8 hours and 5.2 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 32(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.78(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2012).",

In the stratosphere, 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane will slowly photolyze, releasing chlorine atoms which in turn are responsible for removing ozone(4). While some 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane may be lost from the atmosphere by being scavenged by rain, any loss will be returned to the atmosphere by volatilization(SRC). 1,1-Dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane does not contain any chromophores that absorb solar radiation >290 nm and, therefore, it is not susceptible to direct photolysis in the troposphere(SRC).",

Similarly, it also does not contain any groups that would react with atmospheric ozone. In addition 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane does not contain any chromophores that absorb solar radiation >290 nm and therefore make it susceptible to direct photolysis in the troposphere. Therefore, 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane will be extremely persistent in the troposphere. In the stratosphere, 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane will slowly photolyze, releasing chlorine atoms which in turn are responsible for removing ozone(1). Reaction with singlet oxygen should be an additional stratospheric sink but no data on reaction rates are available(2). Calculated stratospheric lifetimes for other completely halogenated fluorochloroethanes are generally hundreds of years(1). While no experimental data on hydrolysis of 1,1-dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane could be found, the rate of hydrolysis of Freon (chlorofluorocarbon) compounds is extremely low(2).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

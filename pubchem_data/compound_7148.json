Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The IR spectra tells you what types of vibrational mode (motion) responses occur in a molecule interacting with infrared light.  It is used to help determine the functional groups in a molecule.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Phenyl ethyl ketone has been detected in drinking water, wastewater, incineration products, forest air, and in roasted filberts. If released to soil, phenyl ethyl ketone will have moderate mobility in soil. Volatilization of phenyl ethyl ketone may be important from moist and dry soil surfaces. Phenyl ethyl ketone will not be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces based upon its lack of absorption of light at wavelengths >290 nm. Insufficient data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of phenyl ethyl ketone in soil or water. If released to water, phenyl ethyl ketone may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water. Phenyl ethyl ketone may volatilize from water surfaces with estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake of 11 hours and 7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 27 suggests that phenyl ethyl ketone will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. Phenyl ethyl ketone will not be susceptible to direct photolysis on water surfaces based upon its lack of absorption of light at wavelengths >290 nm. If released to the atmosphere, phenyl ethyl ketone will exist in the vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase phenyl ethyl ketone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 5 days. Phenyl ethyl ketone will not be susceptible to direct photolysis in the atmosphere based upon its lack of absorption of light at wavelengths >290 nm. (SRC)",

Phenyl ethyl ketone may volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental vapor pressure(4) and water solubility(4) values. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 11 hours and 7 days, respectively(3,SRC). An estimated BCF value of 27(3,SRC), from an experimental log Kow(2), suggests that phenyl ethyl ketone will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC) according to a recommended classification scheme(5). Phenyl ethyl ketone will not be susceptible to direct photolysis on water surfaces based upon its lack of absorption of light at wavelengths >290 nm(6).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This value indicates that phenyl ethyl ketone will volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 11 hours(3,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 7 days(2,SRC). Phenyl ethyl ketone's vapor pressure(1) and Henry's Law constant(1,2,SRC) indicate that volatilization from dry and moist soil may occur(SRC).",

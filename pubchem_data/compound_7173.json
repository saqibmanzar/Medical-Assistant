There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.32X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4-D isopropyl ester will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4-D isopropyl ester will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.3 days. Solutions of the 2,4-D isopropyl ester in water absorb light > 290 nm. Therefore, 2,4-D isopropyl ester may be subject to direct photolysis. If released to soil, 2,4-D isopropyl ester is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 600. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, 2,4-D isopropyl ester is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The 2,4-D isopropyl ester is degraded in a laboratory test by activated sewage acclimated to 2,4-D. The 2,4-D isopropyl ester is degraded at half the rate of the parent acid which reached a constant rate of oxidation in 11 weeks. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 18 days and 210 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 80 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. However, like 2,4-D butyl ester, 2,4-D isopropyl ester may also be readily metabolized in fish and therefore should not bioconcentrate. The hydrolysis half-life of 2,4-D isopropyl ester in water at pH 7.4 and 20 \u00b0C is 23.1 days. Occupational exposure to 2,4-D isopropyl ester may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4-D isopropyl ester is produced or used. Agricultural workers may be exposed to 2,4-D isopropyl ester during spraying operations using herbicides containing this chemical. The general population may be exposed to 2,4-D isopropyl ester via inhalation of ambient air with this compound in regions where spraying is performed. (SRC)",

Volatilization of 2,4-D isopropyl ester from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.3X10-4 mm Hg(4), and its water solubility(2). 2,4-D isopropyl ester is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). In a study, in which 2,4-D isopropyl ester was incubated with domestic sewage microorganisms, 2,4-D isopropyl ester was hydrolyzed and the acid was later decomposed biologically(5). These results are consistent with microbial hydrolysis after a 7 day acclimation period(5). On prairie soils at moisture contents in excess of the wilting point, the isopropyl ester of 2,4-D undergoes very rapid hydrolysis; the ester is completely converted to the corresponding acid and alcohol in < 1 day(6). The rapid rate of the reaction suggests that it is soil-catalyzed(6). The rate of hydrolysis is probably affected by the organic content of the soil and the degradation rate of the free acid should be dependent upon the presence of acclimated microorganisms(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.3X10-4 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 37.3 mg/l(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 18 days and 207 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 80(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). However, like 2,4-D butyl ester, 2,4-D isopropyl ester may also be readily metabolized in fish and therefore should not bioconcentrate(7). The 2,4-D isopropyl ester is degraded in a laboratory test by activated sewage acclimated to 2,4-D(8). The 2,4-D isopropyl ester is degraded at half the rate of the parent acid which reached a constant rate of oxidation in 11 weeks(8). The hydrolysis half-life of 2,4-D isopropyl ester in water at pH 7.4 and 20 \u00b0C is 23.1 days(2). The half-life of 2,4-D isopropyl ester has been calculated to be 17.0 hr at pH 9 and 710 days at pH 6(3). Solutions of 2,4-D isopropyl ester in water absorb light > 290 nm(4). Although the sunlight photolysis of 2,4-D isopropyl ester has not been experimentally determined, several other esters have been studied and found to have half-lives of 2-3 weeks. The products were 2,4-dichlorophenol and compounds resulting from replacement of chlorine by hydroxyl. Photodegradation will be important in surface waters, especially at acid and near neutral pHs where hydrolysis is slow(9,10).",

Vapor-phase 2,4-D isopropyl ester is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.3 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.0X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Solutions of the 2,4-D isopropyl ester in water absorb light > 290 nm(2). Therefore, 2,4-D isopropyl ester may be subject to direct photolysis in the atmosphere(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2.3 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The hydrolysis half-life of 2,4-D isopropyl ester in water at pH 7.4 and 20 \u00b0C is 23.1 days(2). The half-life of 2,4-D isopropyl ester has been calculated to be 17.0 hr at pH 9 and 710 days at pH 6(3). Hydrolysis in natural waters in the presence of humic material is affected by the adsorption of a fraction of the substrate to the humic material. Under acidic conditions, the humic acid catalyzes the reaction resulting in accelerated hydrolysis while under basic conditions the adsorbed material is simply less available resulting in a decrease of the overall hydrolysis rate(4). The hydrolysis in soils is much faster with complete degradation occurring in < 1 day(5). The rapid rate of the reaction suggests that it is catalyzed by soil(5). Solutions of 2,4-D isopropyl ester in water absorb light > 290 nm(6). Although the sunlight photolysis of 2,4-D isopropyl ester has not been experimentally determined, several other esters have been studied and found to have half-lives of 2-3 weeks. The products were 2,4-dichlorophenol and compounds resulting from replacement of chlorine by hydroxyl. Photodegradation will be important in surface waters, especially at acid and near neutral pHs where hydrolysis is slow(2,3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Between the period 1970-71 as part of an EPA Air Monitoring Network study (selected sites in 16 states), the mean concn of 2,4-D isopropyl ester was 0.4 ng/cu m (2.55% of samples pos, 13.7 ng/cu m mean of positive samples) with a max concn of 67.3 ng/cu m(2). Residues of 2,4-D isopropyl ester were determined in central and southern Saskatchewan during the 1966-68 and 1970-75 spraying seasons; up to half of the daily samples contained 2,4-D; the daily mean concn of isopropyl ester was 0.01-1.22 mg/cu m(3). Air samples were collected near wheat-growing areas around Pullman and Kennewick highlands, WA, between April and August 1964 after applications of 2,4-D. Although data were given for several products containing 2,4-D, those for 2,4-D isopropyl ester were highest: avg concn of 0.0116 g/cu m and max concn of 1.9 mg/cu m of aerosol form of ester and avg concn of 0.007 mg/cu m and max concn of 0.69 ug/cu m of vaporized ester were found in 24 hr samples(4).",

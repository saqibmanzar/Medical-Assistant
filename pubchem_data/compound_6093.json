When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Many indications are label indications, approved by a regulatory agency (e.g., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or European Medical Agency), meaning that the manufacturer is allowed to market the drug for the approved indications.  However, some indications are not approved, and therefore, they are called off-label indications.  This section may include both label indications and off-label indications.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

When DBA/2J mice were treated with (14)C niridazole, a metabolite comprising 12-14% of the total radioactivity in 24-hr urine samples was resolved by HPLC. The compound was subsequently isolated from pooled urine of niridazole-treated patients. It was identified as NTCU by mass spectrometry, and the deduced structure was confirmed by chemical synthesis. NTCU is unique among known niridazole metabolites, because it lacks an intact imidazolidinone ring. Its structure allows for a ketoenol tautomerism in which the enolate is stabilized by conjugation with the nitrothiazole ring, as evidenced by a pH-dependent 80-nm red shift in the absorption spectrum. /It was/ hypothesized that NTCU arises via oxidation of an acyclic aldehyde tautomer of 5-hydroxyniridazole, one of two proximate oxidative niridazole metabolites. Indirect evidence for the aldehyde tautomer included the fact that 5-hydroxyniridazole displayed the same pH-dependent spectral shift as NTCU with a single isobestic point at 388 nm. The proposed precursor-product relationship was confirmed when /it was/ found that NTCU formation from 5-hydroxyniridazole was catalyzed by NAD(+)-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3). The activity copurified with benzaldehyde dehydrogenase activity from mouse liver cytosol. Furthermore, benzaldehyde was a competitive inhibitor of 5-hydroxyniridazole dehydrogenase activity. These results demonstrate that 5-hydroxyniridazole is not an end product of niridazole metabolism. Because biotransformation of niridazole to its 4- and 5-hydroxy derivatives has been implicated in the drug's carcinogenicity and central nervous system toxicity, NTCU formation appears to represent a detoxication pathway in mammals.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

By contrast, embryo and yolk sac homogenates or liver microsomes appeared to require anaerobiasis. Malformation incidence--specifically, axial asymmetry--showed a strong correlation with nitroreductase activity rates when the latter were modulated by oxygen tension. Data presented here suggest that when embryos are exposed to niridazole under conditions of low oxygen in vitro, redox cycling ensues with molecular oxygen serving to oxidize early reduction products. This process continues, regenerating the parent compound until oxygen is depleted locally. The basis of this localized depletion is unknown, but inability of the immature supply system to replete oxygen or demand by precociously aerobic tissues may be involved. Once local anaerobiasis is attained, further reduction could generate toxic metabolites capable of covalently binding cellular macromolecules. Localized hypoxia represents another potential mechanism of dysmorphogenesis.",

Although the urinary excretion of iron was increased by the drug, iron excretion was significantly decreased during the drug-induced excretion of copper after copper poisoning. Formation of a copper-niridazole chelate or chelates before excretion in the bile or urine may explain these findings. Polarity and molecular weights of the metal-drug chelates formed in vivo may be the directing forces not only in the selection of the metal for chelation, but also for its urinary or biliary excretion. The laboratory preparation of two copper-niridazole complexes lends support to these conclusions.",

The urine pigment has been observed during niridazole treatment of schistosomiasis, but has not been documented during treatment of other diseases. Urinary beta-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) concentration increased proportionately to the amount of red/brown pigment in the urine. Concurrently, sterile pyuria developed. The duration of the time urine was in the bladder was directly related to the concentration of beta-glucuronidase and to the intensity of the red/brown urine color, there being much more in infrequently than in frequently voided urine specimens. Pigment development appears to occur in the bladder. The associated and possibly contributing components appear to be niridazole or one of its metabolites, beta-glucuronidase from the kidneys or from urinary granulocytes, and possibly a schistosomal factor. Given time, this combination generated the red/brown pigment.",

A daily ip dosage range was chosen so that the lethal effect, ascribed to central nervous system toxicity, did not occur before 4 to 5 days. Death was always preceded by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure which terminated in respiratory arrest. In B6 mice the LD50 was 202 mg/kg/day while in D2 mice the LD50 was 146 mg/kg/day; the LD50 for niridazol in similarly treated F1 hybrid mice was found to be the arithmetic mean of the LD50 values for the parental strains (172 mg/kg/day). Determination of the level of niridazol in the plasma and brains of B6 and D2 mice treated subacutely with the same daily dose of niridazol failed to reveal any strain differences. Moreover, there was no evidence of in vivo accumulation of niridazole with subacute treatment which suggests that a niridazol metabolite is responsible for the observed toxicity. An association between susceptibility to the lethal effects of niridazol and the Ah locus is suggested by experiments in backcross and F2 mice. The incidence of death observed after subacute treatment with 162 mg/kg/day of niridazole matched that predicted on the basis of genotype, ie, it was lethal to 72% of nonresponsive and 38% of aromatic hydrocarbon responsive mice.[Blumer JL et al; J Pharmacol Exp Ther 212 (3): 509-13 (1980) ]",

The acute LD50 for 4-keto niridazole i.p. was 55 mg/kg in DBA/2J mice and 51 mg/kg in C57BL/6J mice; the comparable value for niridazole was 220 mg/kg in DBA/2J mice. Signs of acute 4-keto niridazole toxicity were different from those of niridazole toxicity and consisted of profound sedation and labored, irregular breathing terminating in respiratory arrest. Daily i.p. injection of 30 mg/kg of 4-keto niridazole for 5 days into DBA/2J mice resulted in no evidence of cumulative toxicity. The serum and brain concentrations of 4-keto niridazole after a 70-mg/kg i.p. LD90 dose of this compound were 93 micrograms/ml and 7.5 micrograms/g just before death. If an LD90 dose of niridazole (285 mg/kg) was injected into DBA/2J mice, the serum and brain concentrations of 4-keto niridazole just before death were 15 and 5%, respectively, of those found after an LD90 dose of 4-keto niridazole. Thus, 4-keto niridazole does not appear to account for the central nervous system toxicity of niridazole.[Catto BA et al; J Pharmacol Exp Ther 228 (3): 662-8 (1984)]",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

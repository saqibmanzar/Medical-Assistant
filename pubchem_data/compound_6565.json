ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The radioactivity was excreted via the urine (66-76%), feces (13-21%), and as carbon dioxide (8%) with only 2% exhaled as unchanged 2,3-dichloropropene. After 72 hours, only 2-3% of the dose remained in the carcass. More than 90% of an oral dose was absorbed. After inhalation exposure, absorption (35%), metabolism and excretion were linear over a 100-fold dose range, from 1.3 to 180 ug (14)Carbon 2,3-dichloropropene vapor per liter of air for 6 hours. Approximately 50% of the (14)Carbon was recovered in urine, 15% in feces, and 8% was carbon dioxide with most of the remainder adhering to the pelt. There was no evidence of tissue accumulation and essentially all the (14)Carbon excreted was as metabolites of 2,3-dichloropropene Tissue distribution, clearance, and time to steady state also have been determined.",

Uptake and elimination of (14)Carbon was studied in rats after nose only inhalation of 17, 240, or 1650 nmol of (14)C-2,3-dichloropropene vapor/l of air (0.4, 6, or 40 ppm, respectively, at 760 mm and 25 \u00b0C) for 6 hr. The percentage of inhaled 2,3-dichloropropene absorbed averaged 38% and was not statistically different at any vapor concn, although minute volume was lower during exposure to 1650 nmol/l. Urine, feces, and expired air were collected from rats for 65 hr after exposure. Rats were sacrificed and tissues, carcass, excreta, and expired air were analyzed for (14)C. Routes of (14)C excretion were independent of were analyzed for (14)C. Routes of (14)C excretion were independent of vapor concn, with 50% of the (14)Carbon excreted in urine, 13% in feces, approximately 7% as carbon dioxide, and < 1% as 2,3-dichloropropene in expired air. Rates of (14)C excretion were also independent of vapor concn, with the half-times averaging 9.9 hr (urine), 13.6 hr (feces), and 0.9 hr ((14)CO2). Sixty hours after inhalation, 29% of the initial body burden of (14)C remained in the carcass. Most was associated with the pelt, but some (14)C was found in all tissues. Respiratory tract, GI tract, liver, and kidney were tissues with the highest (14)C contents. The results indicate the 2,3-dichloropropene metabolism and excretion rates are relatively constant throughout the vapor concn range studied.",

The other involves hydrolysis and dechlorination to form an intermediate\n(2-chloroallyl alcohol) that can either be detoxified by conjugation to glucuronic acid or bioactivated by\nalcohol dehydrogenase to form the mutagen 2-chloroacrolein. It is evident that depletion of glutathione stores, more likely to occur under bolus exposure conditions, would result in the formation of proportionally more mutagenic metabolites (L893).",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Besides the direct genotoxic effects, metabolic activation mechanisms are also conceivable. Epoxidation seems to play a minor role in bioactivation, whereas the metabolic formation of strongly mutagenic alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds is obviously of great importance for the indirect genotoxicity of allylic compounds. Only in the case of 2,3-dichloro-1-propene is an epoxide formed which is extremely unstable and immediately rearranges to the strong mutagen, 1,3-dichloroacetone.",

Some fumigants are corrosive to the cornea and may cause BLINDNESS. Specialized medical treatment should be obtained promptly following removal of toxicant by copious flushing with clean water. Skin contamination may cause BLISTERING and deep chemical burns. Absorption of some fumigants across the skin may be sufficient to cause systemic poisoning in the absence of fumigant inhalation. For all these reasons, decontamination of eyes and skin must must be IMMEDIATE and THROUGH. 2. REMOVE victims of fumigant inhalation to FRESH AIR immediately. Even though initial symptoms and signs are mild, keep the victim quiet, in a semi-reclining position. Minimum pohysical activity limits the likehood ofpulmonary edema. 3. If victim is not breathing, clear the airway of secretions and RESUSCITATE with positive poressure oxygen apparatus. If this is not available, use chest compression to sustain respiration. If victim is pulseless, employ cardiac resuscitation. 4. If PULMONARY EDEMA is evident, there are several measures avilable to sustain life. Medical judgement must be relied upon, however, in the management of each case. The following procedures are generally recommended: A. Put the victim in a SITTING position with a backrest. B. Use intermittent and/or continuous positive pressure OXYGEN to relieve hypoxemia. ... C. Slowly administer FUROSEMIDE, 40 mg, or SODIUM ETHACRYNATE, 50 mg, to reduce venous load by inducing diuresis. ... D. Morphine in small doses (5-10 mg), slowly, iv to allay anxiety and promote deeper respiratory excursions. E. Administer AMINOPHYLLINE (0.25-0.50 gm) slowly, iv. ... F. Digitalization may be considered, but there is a serious risk of arrhythmias in an anoxic and toxic myocardium. G. TRACHEOSTOMY may be necessary in some cases to facilitate aspiration of large amounts of pulmonary edema fluid. H. Epinephrine, atorpine, and expectorants are generally not helpful, and may complicate treatment. I. Watch for RECURRENT PULMONARY EDEMA, even up to 2 weeks after the initial episode. Limit victim's physical activity for at least 4 weeks. Severe physical weakness usually indicates persistent pulmonary injury. Serial pulmonary function testing may be useful in assessing recovery. 5. Combat SHOCK by placing victim in the Trendelenburg position and administering plasma, whole blood, and/or electrolyte and glucose solutions intravenously, with great care, to avoid pulmonary edema. Central venous pressure should be monitored continously. Vasopressor amines must be given with great caution, because of the irritability of the myocardium. 6. Control CONVULSIONS. Seizures are most likely to occur in poisonings by methyl bromide, hydrogen cyanide, acrylonitrile, phosphine, and carbon disulfide. ... /Fumigant poisoning/",

If a FUMIGANT LIQUID OR SOLID has been INGESTED less than several hours prior to treatment, quantities remaining in the stomach must be removed as effectively as possible by gastric intubation, aspiration, and lavage, after all possible precautions have been taken to protect the respiratory tract from aspirated gasric contents. A. Put in place a cuffed ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE prior to gastric intubation. Administer OXYGEN, using a mechanical ventilator if respiration is depressed. B. Lavage the stomach with a slurry of ACTIVATED CHARCOAL in saline or water. Leave a volume of the slurry in the stomach with an appropriate dose of sorbitol as cathartic ... . C. If treatment is delayed and if the patient remains fully alert, adminsiter activated charcoal and sorbitol orally. ... Repeated administration of charcoal at half or more the initial dosage every 2-4 hours may be beneficial. D. Do not given vegetable or animal fats or oils, which enhance gastrointestinal absorption of many of the fumigant compounds. 8. Intravenous infusions of GLUCOSE are valuable in limiting the heptotoxicity of many substances. Monitor central venous presure to avoid precipitating, or aggravating, pulmonary edema by fluid overlaod. The victim should be watched closely for indications of delayed or recurrent pulmonary edema, and for bronchophenumonia. Fluid balance should be monitored, and urine sediment should be checked regularly for indications of tubular injury. Measure serum alkaline phosphatase, LDH, ALT, AST, and bilirubin to assess liver injury. 9. HEMOPERFUSION OVER ACTIVATED CHARCOAL has been used in managing a case of carbon tetrachloride poisoning with apparent success. ... 10. EXTRACORPOREAL HEMODIALYSIS may be needed to regulate extracellular fluid composition if renal failure supervenes. It is probably not very effective in removing lipophilic fumigant compounds from blood, but is, of course, effective in controlling extracellular fluid composition if renal failure occurs. /Fumigant poisoning/",

Administer oxygen if there is evidence of altered mental status or dyspnea. Treat hypotension with volume expansion & vasopression. Use lidocaine or beta-blockers for ventricular arrhythmias. Skin: Remove contaminated clothing. Wash affected area with soap & copious amounts or water. Eye: Irrigate the eye for 15-20 min. Obtain a consultation if symptoms persist. Oral: Most of the halogenated solvents ingested in quantities of 1-2 swallows may be partially removed by ipecac-induced emesis if admin within a few hr to a patient who has not lost the gag reflex, is not seizing, is not markedly lethargic, or is not in coma. Observe the patient in the upright position to lessen the possibility of aspiration. Activated charcoal is probably ineffective. Inhalation: Move from the contaminated area. Provide a source of oxygen & prepare for mechanical ventilation. If the patient is unconscious & the pulse is absent, initiate CPR measures. Enhancement of Elimination: Maintain good ventilation. Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion are not likely to be useful because of the high lipophilic properties of these solvents. Antidote: N-acetylcysteine may restore depleted glutathione stores, but no adequate clinical studies are available to validate this possible treatment. Supportive Care: Watch for cardiac dysrhythmias, aspiration pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, & hypoxic encephalopathy. Monitor for arrhythmia for at least 24 hr & for hepatorenal failure for about 3 days. Obtain a chest x-ray, arterial blood gas, EKG, serum creatinine, & hepatic aminotransferase. Check electrolyte imbalance daily. Treat renal failure with dialysis & hepatic failure with fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K, a low-protein diet, neomycin, & lactulose. Watch fluid & electrolyte balance. /Halogenated hydrocarbons/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 61.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,3-dichloro-1-propene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,3-dichloro-1-propene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. If released to soil, 2,3-dichloro-1-propene is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 67. Based on slow rates in soil, biodegradation in water is not expected to be an important environmental fate process. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.82X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 2,3-Dichloro-1-propene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation in soil proceeds slowly. If released into water, 2,3-dichloro-1-propene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hrs and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 8 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The hydrolysis half-life of 2,3-dichloro-1-propene is approximately 27 days at 29 \u00b0C, with the formation of 2-chloro-3-hydroxy-1-propene. Occupational exposure to 2,3-dichloro-1-propene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,3-dichloro-1-propene is produced or where products containing this compound as an impurity are produced or used.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.82X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hrs and 4 days, respectively(SRC). 2,3-Dichloropropene is hydrolysed, with a half-life of approximately 27 days, at 29 \u00b0C(7). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 8(SRC), from its water solubiulity of 2,150 mg/l(2) and a regression-derived equation(5) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 2,3-dichloro-1-propene with ozone has been estimated as 2.2X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) using a structure estimation method(3). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 51 days at an atmospheric concn of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(4). 2,3-Dichloropropene is hydrolysed, with a half-life of approximately 27 days, at 29 \u00b0C(6). Dichloro-1-propene is not expected to directly photolyze due to the lack of absorption in the environmental UV spectrum (>290 nm). 2,3-Dichloro-1-propene adsorbed on silica gel is mineralized when it is exposed to radiation from a Hg-high pressure lamp which has passed through a pyrex filter (absorbs radiation <290 nm) in the presence of pure oxygen(5). In 6 days of irradiation 50-90% of CO2 or HCl/Cl2 was produced(5). Hydrolysis of 2,3-dichloro-1-propene leads to the formation of 2-chloro-3-hydroxy-1-propene with a half-life of 27 days at 29 \u00b0C(6) and 22 days at 25 \u00b0C(7).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In this area of the country, soil fumigants, containing 2,3-dichlorpropene impurities, were used primarily for the control of pathogenic nematodes in raspberry production. 2,3-Dichloropropene was detected in three of the 42 domestic wells analyzed in the study; all within the same area. Maximum measured 2,3-dichloropropene concn was 0.67 ug/l(1). Researchers found that concns changed with depth; highest in the intermediate depth (6.3 m) and lowest at the deeper depth (12.3 m). Concns also appeared to be higher during the fall and winter recharge period(1).",

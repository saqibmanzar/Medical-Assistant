When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In short, by pre-empting a vital building block in the genetic material of the Herpes simplex virus, Herplex-D topical solution destroys the infective and destructive capacity of the viral material. The virus infected cell may only be attacked during the period of active synthesis of DNA. This occurs early in the development of the Herpes simplex lesion, but at different times in different cells. Therefore, ideally, the affected area should remain saturated with the antiviral agent.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

During several rapid infusions of idoxuridine (50 mg/min) significant quantities of the drug were found in serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Idoxuridine is not significantly bound to serum proteins and is not deiodinated in fresh serum or urine in vitro to inactive products (iodouracil, uracil, iodide). It is rapidly excreted into the urine. Inactivation of IDU occurs in tissues. This antiviral assay of IDU in body fluids should be applicable to other viruses and potential antiviral agents.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Top CSF levels of IUD and metabolites of less than 4 microgram/mL, about 1/10 of the corresponding plasma level, were obtained after 6 hours of continuous infusion. The result is discussed and compared with a similar study made on 5 healthy beagle dogs where in addition the levels obtained in various parts of the brain were determined. In the animal experiment a mean value of 2.5 microgram/ml of IDU and metabolites was obtained in the CSF after 8 hours, less than 1/20 of the plasma level.

These maliformations include exophthalmos and clubbing of the forelegs. By contrast, trifluorothymidine (F3TdR), another highly effective antiherpetic agent currently under investigation but not available for general use, was found not to be teratogenic to rabbits, even when given in concentrations tenfold greater than the doses used to produce idoxuridine teratogenicity.[Itoi M et al; Arch Ophthalmol 93 (1): 46-51 (1975)]",

Offspring were killed at 10 and 20 days of age and the cerebellum, eye, and kidney examined histologically. All offspring of mice treated with 400 mg/kg IUDR were stillborn or died within the first 48 h of life, and deaths occurred at other dosages in both species. In IUDR-exposed mice and rats there was persistence of granule cells in the external granular layer, and scattered foci of microcystic tubular change in the renal cortices. ...The teratogenic effects of IUDR were minimal and were induced by dosages much higher than normally used in human medicine.[Percy DH; Teratology 11 (1): 103-17 (1975)]",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

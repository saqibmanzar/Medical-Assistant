PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Epidemiological studies of  semiconductor populations evaluated potential adverse reproductive outcomes. ...  In each of these studies, workers were exposed to mixtures including diglyme but not to diglyme alone. ...  Exposure to EGEs was determined using questionnaires from subjects about the work performed and an assessment of the work environment by industrial hygienists, but no measurements of personal or area exposures were made. Workers in the fabrication area were considered exposed to EGEs. For the retrospective study, information on pregnancy outcomes and potential confounders (age, smoking, ethnicity, education, income, year of pregnancy, and stress) was obtained through a comprehensive interviewer-administered interview of female employees. The prospective study of early fetal loss and fecundity (probability of conception per menstrual cycle) was conducted in a subset of female employees from five plants. Daily diaries and measurements of daily urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels for 6 months were collected in addition to the comprehensive interview. Of the 891 medically verified pregnancies identified for the retrospective study, 774 (86.9%) were live births, 113 (12.7%) were spontaneous abortions, and 4 (0.4%) were stillbirths. The overall unadjusted relative risk (RR) for spontaneous abortions was 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-2.05) and changed little after adjusting for confounders (adjusted RR =1.43; 95% CI = 0.95-2.09). When stratified by work group, the risk of spontaneous abortion was statistically significantly increased for female workers in the photolithography group (RR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.04-2.55) and in the etching group (RR = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.27-3.19). For women working with higher levels of EGE only in masking, the risk for spontaneous abortion was increased 3-fold (RR = 3.38; 95% CI = 1.61-5.73). In the prospective study, no statistically significant differences were detected in the overall rate of spontaneous abortions between fabrication and non-fabrication workers or when pregnancy outcomes were examined by work group. However, the ability to conceive was lower among female workers exposed to EGEs (fertility rate [FR] = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.11-1.19). /Ethylene glycol ethers/",

Ocular reactions were graded in accordance with the Consumer Product Safety Act, Title 16 CFR 1500.42 at 1, 2, and 3 days after instillation of the test material. TGEE ws found to be mildly irritating. Conjunctival redness, chemosis and/or discharge scores of 1 or 2 were noted at 24 hours in all rabbits. These findings completely resolved in 2 rabbits by 72 hours. ... Iris and corneal opacity scores of 0 were observed in all animals at each time point. The total conjunctival score [(redness + chemosis + discharge) x 2] at 24 hours ranged from 2-8 out of a possible 20. The highest overall score was 8 out of a possible 110.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.01 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates triethylene glycol monoethyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase triethylene glycol monoethyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8.5 hours. If released to soil, triethylene glycol monoethyl ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.8X10-14 atm-cu m/mole. Based on aqueous studies giving degradation ranges of 1% to 100% from 5 to 20 days, respectively, triethylene glycol monoethyl ether is expected to biodegrade in soil and water. If released into water, triethylene glycol monoethyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to triethylene glycol monoethyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where triethylene glycol monoethyl ether is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to triethylene glycol monoethyl ether via dermal content with brake fluid, and via ingestion of contaminated drinking water.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It sets up criteria for the classification of chemicals for physical-chemical, health, and environmental hazards of chemical substances and mixtures and sets up standardized hazard information to facilitate global trade of chemicals.  Please note that obsolete codes are added in this classification for completeness purposes, as they are still in use. Any obsolete codes are annotated as such.",

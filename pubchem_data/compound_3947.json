Patients were identified for the study using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Brief Assessment Schedule Depression Cards (BASDEC). Sixty-three subjects were randomised: 46 patients completed the entire trial of 28 days treatment. BASDEC and GDS were administered on day 8 post-admission, and depressed patients were randomised double-blind to either low dose lofepramine (70 mg daily) (n = 23) or placebo (n = 23). Assessment of changes in depressive states were made using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) on days 8, 18 and 36 post-admission. Both groups improved by a similar amount during the trial. Lofepramine tended to be more effective than placebo in those patients who were more depressed (GDS > or = 18). On the other hand, subjects who were less depressed (i.e. GDS < 18) improved more on placebo than lofepramine. Low dose lofepramine may prove useful in moderately or severely depressed patients treated for only 4 weeks. However, low dose lofepramine is not indicated for mild (GDS 15-18) depression.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Both compounds were hydroxylated and demethylated by a NADPH-generating system in rat and human liver microsomes. Three metabolites were in common for the two drugs, namely desipramine (DMI), 2-hydroxydesipramine (2-OH-DMI) and didesmethylimipramine (DDMI). Lofepramine was also metabolized to three unique tricyclic metabolites. Comparisons with authentic reference compounds suggested that two of these metabolites were 2-hydroxylofepramine and desmethyllofepramine. The ratio between the concentrations of DDMI and DMI was higher for lofepramine than imipramine. This is probably due to DDMI formation via two parallel metabolic pathways of lofepramine, i.e. DMI and desmethyllofepramine, respectively. It is speculated that the different metabolic pattern of lofepramine as compared with desipramine and imipramine is of importance for the therapeutic profile of the drug.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

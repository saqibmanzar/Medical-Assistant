It was developed by the British Ministry of Defence as a riot control agent in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Dibenz(b,F)-1,4-oxazepine is a lachrymatory agent (LA), exerting its effects through activation of the TRPA1 channel. It is a suspected carcinogen. It is toxic, but less so than CS gas (2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile), by ingestion and exposure. However, it can be lethal in large quantities. In a poorly ventilated space, an individual may inhale a lethal dose within minutes. Death is caused by asphyxiation and pulmonary edema. The effect of CR is long-term and persistent. CR can persist on surfaces, especially porous ones, for up to 60 days.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

In blood, both in vivo and in liver perfusates, CR concentrations decreased biphasically to be replaced initially with CR-lactam (dihydrodibenz[b,f]-1,4-oxazepine-11(10H)-one), followed by the sulfates of the 7-, 4- and 9-hydroxylactams. The rate of disappearance of CR in liver perfusates was slower than in vivo. Bile contained only small amounts of sulphate conjugates and significant amounts of conjugated 2-amino-2'-hydroxymethyldiphenyl ether (amino alcohol). This was not identified in the urine or blood of rats. Preliminary studies in rhesus monkey and the guinea-pig show similar excretory patterns and metabolites. However, only free hydroxylactams were isolated from monkey urine and traces of the amino alcohol were detected in guinea-pig urine. Whole-body autoradiography of mice confirm the rapid disappearance of CR from blood into heart, liver, kidneys and small intestine with evidence of biliary excretion. It is consistent with the rat studies showing the rapid absorption of a highly lipophilic compound undergoing hepatic metabolism, biliary secretion, enterohepatic recirculation and renal excretion. /Dibenz[b,f]-1,4-[11(14)-C]oxazepine (CR)/",

Reaction (a) is NADPH-dependent, decreased by dialysis and methylene blue, whereas reaction (b) is heat-resistant, inactivated by dialysis, inhibited by CN-, p-chloromercuribenzoate, amytal and menadione, and stimulated by methylene blue, phenazine methosulphate and 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol. Reaction (a) is similar to that of aldehyde reductases (E.C.1.1.1.2) and reaction (b) to that of molybdenum hydroxylases (E.C.1.2.3.1). Reaction (a) is also catalysed by an NADH-dependent enzyme in liver microsomes and subsequent hydroxylation of the lactam also occurs in this cell fraction. Some extrahepatic metabolism of CR occurs via the same routes in kidney, small intestine and lung, though the yield is limited. Digestive gland extract of Helix pomatia converts CR to its lactam in significant amounts. The metabolism of CR in vitro is similar to that predicted from observations in vivo. /CR (dibenz[b,f]-1,4-oxazepine)/",

The ring-opened 2-amino 2'-hydroxymethyldiphenyl ether (amino alcohol) added to isolated perfused rat liver was rapidly cleared in bile as a mixture of highly polar conjugates, whereas the major route of excretion in vivo was as the 4-, 7- and 9-hydroxylactam sulfates in urine. The lactam of CR was eliminated exclusively in urine giving the same products as obtained for CR, but the distribution of metabolites of the C10-C11 dihydro derivative of CR was unlike that of the parent compound indicating that it occupies only a peripheral role in the fate of CR in vivo. A mixture of 7-, 4- and 9-hydroxylactams derived from the enzymic hydrolysis of urinary sulphates was rapidly removed from blood, sulphated and secreted as sulphates into blood both in vivo and in isolated perfused liver. Little biliary excretion occurred. When the urinary sulfates of the hydroxy lactams were administered i.v. to rats, 70% was eliminated in urine within 1 hr; however, if the kidneys were ligated biliary excretion of sulphate was higher (58% in 5 h). After intraduodenal administration of the biliary conjugates of CR metabolism, all of the dose was resorbed to be re-secreted in bile or excreted as sulphates in urine. These studies confirm that the major metabolic fate of CR in the rat is oxidation to lactam, followed by ring hydroxylation, sulfation and urinary excretion. /Dibenz[b,f]-1,4-oxazepine (CR)/",

There was no organ-specific pathology. Comparison of the acute toxicity of CR with that of two other peripheral sensory irritants, 1-chloroacetophenone (CN) and 2-chlorobenzyl-lidene malononitrile (CS), shows CR to be significantly less toxic than either of them. Pyrotechnically generated CR smoke was more toxic than pure (thermally generated) aerosols of CR; this was due to the presence of pyrotechnic decomposition products in the atmosphere from the burning of the smoke generating composition. However, the median lethal toxicity of pyrotechnically generated CR smoke was very significantly less than that of either pyrotechnically generated CN or CS smokes. Short-term cumulative toxicity did not occur following multiple oral dosing with CR. The acute toxicology of three ether intermediates encountered in the synthesis of CR from 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene and sodium phenoxide (2-nitrodiphenyl ether, 2-aminodiphenyl ether and 2-formamidodiphenyl ether) was investigated; all three ethers were found to be less acutely toxic than CR itself.  /Dibenz(b,f)-1,4-oxazepine/",

Tear gas is the common name for substances that, in low concentrations, cause pain in the eyes, flow of tears and difficulty in keeping the eyes open. Only three agents are likely to be deployed: (i) 1-chloroacetophenone (CN); (ii) 2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS); or (iii) dibenz[b,f]-1,4-oxazepine (CR). CN is the most toxic lacrimator and at high concentrations has caused corneal epithelial damage and chemosis. It has accounted for at least five deaths, which have resulted from pulmonary injury and/or asphyxia. CS is a 10-times more potent lacrimator than CN but is less systemically toxic. CR is the most potent lacrimator with the least systemic toxicity and is highly stable. CN, CS and CR cause almost instant pain in the eyes, excessive flow of tears and closure of the eyelids, and incapacitation of exposed individuals. Apart from the effects on the eyes, these agents also cause irritation in the nose and mouth, throat and airways and sometimes to the skin, particularly in moist and warm areas. In situations of massive exposure, tear gas, which is swallowed, may cause vomiting. Serious systemic toxicity is rare and occurs most frequently with CN; it is most likely to occur when these agents are used in very high concentrations within confined non-ventilated spaces. Based on the available toxicological and medical evidence, CS and CR have a large safety margin for life-threatening or irreversible toxic effects. There is no evidence that a healthy individual will experience long-term health effects from open-air exposures to CS or CR, although contamination with CR is less easy to remove. /Dibenz[b,f]-1,4-oxazepine (CR)/",

A solution splashed in the mouth causes burning of the tongue and palate and salivation for 5 to 10 minutes. If a splash enters the nose, it causes irritation and rhinorrhea. Skin exposure causes burning within a few minutes, which persists for 15 to 30 minutes, and an erythema lasting for 1 to 2 hours.

Animals were killed at intervals from 15 min to 2 days, and the lungs examined macroscopically, by electron microscopy and conventional histology. There were no deaths during or after exposure. Macroscopically the lungs from all rats appeared normal. Microscopically there were a few areas of mild congestion, hemorrhage and emphysema, but there was little variation between the different groups. Electron micrographs revealed some morphological alteration of the epithelium and endothelium but only occasional changes in the interstitium. The alterations took the form of \"ballooning\" of the endothelium with isolated foci of swelling and thickening of the epithelium. Interstitial edema was observed in one animal only which was exposed to the highest concentration. The effects appeared similar in all groups, and are thought to be transient. The results of this investigation suggest that even high doses of CR aerosols cause minimal damage to the lung, and the structural alterations which do occur are believed to be due to the stress to which the animals were subjected during the exposure period."

The damage was not severe with CR (2830 mg/cu m) but in the case of CN (60.26 mg/cu m) it was evident up to 30th day post exposure. Necrobiosis, attenuation of bronchiolar epithelium, edema in the air ways and also in the lumen of alveoli leading to substantial changes in the histoarchitecture of the lung were observed during CN exposure.

However, in CN exposed animals, a significant elevation of the activities of GOT, GPT, acid and alkaline phosphatase was observed at different intervals.

Both chemicals caused a significant decrease in body weight gain. Histological changes in lung, liver and kidneys were more severe after 10 than after 5 days of exposure and were more severe in CN-exposed than in CR-exposed mice. Organ weight to body weight ratios remained normal except for the spleen to body weight ratio, which decreased in CN-exposed mice after both 5 and 10 days of exposure. Biochemical indicators showed a toxic response only in CN-exposed mice, but the only consistent change was an increase in blood glucose. Hepatic alkaline phosphatase was not influenced, malondialdehyde concentration and acid phosphatase activity were increased only after 5 days of exposure and liver GSH concentration decreased after 10 days of exposure. Results indicate that CN is not only more toxic than CR in absolute terms but is also more toxic at the 5% level of their LC50. /Dibenz[b,f]-1,4-oxazepine (CR)/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.1X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates that dibenz(b,f)[1,4]oxazepine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dibenz(b,f)[1,4]oxazepine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 hour. Dibenz(b,f)[1,4]oxazepine contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight; however, the kinetics of this potential reaction are not known. If released to soil, an estimated Koc value of 1020 indicates that dibenz(b,f)[1,4]oxazepine is expected to have low mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil is expected to be an important environmental fate process based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.1X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Dibenz(b,f)[1,4]oxazepine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based on its estimated vapor pressure. If released into water, dibenz(b,f)[1,4]oxazepine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important environmental fate process based upon the estimated Henry's Law constant of this compound. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 42 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Dibenz(b,f)[1,4]oxazepine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure and exposure to the general population to dibenz(b,f)[1,4]oxazepine should be rare since this compound is solely used as a riot control agent. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

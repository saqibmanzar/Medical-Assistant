ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Preexposed and unexposed skin was then dermatomed and placed in flow-through in vitro diffusion cells. Five cells with exposed skin and four cells with unexposed skin were dosed with a mixture of 14 different hydrocarbons (HC) consisting of nonane, decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, ethyl benzene, o-xylene, trimethyl benzene (TMB), cyclohexyl benzene (CHB), naphthalene, and dimethyl naphthalene (DMN) in water + ethanol (50:50) as diluent. Another five cells containing only JP-8-exposed skin were dosed solely with diluent in order to determine the skin retention of jet fuel HC. The absorption parameters of flux, diffusivity, and permeability were calculated for the studied HC. The data indicated that there was a two-fold and four-fold increase in absorption of specific aromatic HC like ethyl benzene, o-xylene, and TMB through 1- and 4-d JP-8 preexposed skin, respectively. Similarly, dodecane and tridecane were absorbed more in 4-d than 1-d JP-8 preexposed skin experiments. The absorption of naphthalene and DMN was 1.5 times greater than the controls in both 1- and 4-d preexposures. CHB, naphthalene, and DMN had significant persistent skin retention in 4-d preexposures as compared to 1-d exposures that might leave skin capable of further absorption several days postexposure. The possible mechanism of an increase in HC absorption in fuel preexposed skin may be via lipid extraction from the stratum corneum as indicated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. This study suggests that the preexposure of skin to jet fuel enhances the subsequent in vitro percutaneous absorption of HC, so single-dose absorption data for jet fuel HC from naive skin may not be optimal to predict the toxic potential for repeated exposures. For certain compounds, persistent absorption may occur days after the initial exposure.",

The present study is an ongoing approach to assess the dose-related percutaneous absorption of a number of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. The first treatment (1X) was comprised of mixtures containing undecane (4.1%), dodecane (4.7%), tridecane (4.4%), tetradecane (3%), pentadecane (1.6%), naphthalene (1.1%), and dimethyl naphthalene (1.3% of jet fuels) in hexadecane solvent using porcine skin flow through diffusion cell. Other treatments (n=4 cells) were 2X and 5X concentrations. Perfusate samples were analyzed with gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) using head space solid phase micro-extraction fiber technique. We have standardized the assay to have a good linear correlation for all the tested components in media standards. Absorption parameters including diffusivity, permeability, steady state flux, and percent dose absorbed were estimated for all the tested hydrocarbons. This approach provides a baseline to access component interactions among themselves and with the diluent (solvents). A quantitative structure permeability relationship (QSPR) model was derived to predict the permeability of unknown jet fuel hydrocarbons in this solvent system by using their physicochemical parameters. Our findings suggested a dose related increase in absorption for naphthalene and dimethyl naphthalene (DMN).",

The blood:air PC values for n-C8 to n-C12 were 3.1, 5.8, 8.1, 20.4, and 24.6, respectively. The lipid solubility of n-alkanes increases with carbon length, suggesting that lipid solubility is an important determinant in describing n-alkane blood:air PC values. The muscle:blood, liver:blood, brain:blood, and fat:blood PC values were octane (1.0, 1.9, 1.4, and 247), nonane (0.8, 1.9, 3.8, and 274), decane (0.9, 2.0, 4.8, and 328), undecane (0.7, 1.5, 1.7, and 529), and dodecane (1.2, 1.9, 19.8, and 671), respectively. The tissue:blood PC values were greatest in fat and the least in muscle. The brain:air PC value for undecane was inconsistent with other n-alkane values. Using the measured partition coefficient values of these n-alkanes, linear regression was used to predict tissue (except brain) and blood:air partition coefficient values for larger n-alkanes, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, and heptadecane (n-C13 to n-C17). Good agreement between measured and predicted tissue:air and blood:air partition coefficient values for n-C8 to n-Cl2 offer confidence in the partition coefficient predictions for longer chain n-alkanes.",

One of these is S-8, a replacement jet fuel synthesized using the Fischer-Tropsch process, which contains no aromatic compounds and is mainly composed of straight and branched alkanes. Metabolites of S-8 fuel in laboratory animals have not been identified. The goal of this study was to identify metabolic products from exposure to aerosolized S-8 and a designed straight-chain alkane/polyaromatic mixture (decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, naphthalene, and 2-methylnaphthalene) in male Fischer 344 rats. Collected blood and tissue samples were analyzed for 70 straight and branched alcohols and ketones ranging from 7 to 15 carbons. No fuel metabolites were observed in the blood, lungs, brain, and fat following S-8 exposure. Metabolites were detected in the liver, urine, and feces. Most of the metabolites were 2- and 3-position alcohols and ketones of prominent hydrocarbons with very few 1- or 4-position metabolites. Following exposure to the alkane mixture, metabolites were observed in the blood, liver, and lungs. Interestingly, heavy metabolites (3-tridecanone, 2-tridecanol, and 2-tetradecanol) were observed only in the lung tissues possibly indicating that metabolism occurred in the lungs. With the exception of these heavy metabolites, the metabolic profiles observed in this study are consistent with previous studies reporting on the metabolism of individual alkanes. Further work is needed to determine the potential metabolic interactions of parent, primary, and secondary metabolites and identify more polar metabolites. Some metabolites may have potential use as biomarkers of exposure to fuels.",

A method originally utilized for determination of poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in foods was ... adapted for the digestion of tissue and extraction of hydrocarbons from shellfish exposed to petroleum during bioassays. Tissue extracts were partitioned into saturate and aromatic fractions by column chromatography. Using gas-liquid chromatography, the n-alkanes of carbon numbers 12 to 19, and the methyl substituted naphthalenes were identified in the saturate and aromatic fractions, respectively. Both groups of compounds were quantitated by reference to an internal standard.  The procedure allowed recovery of over 70 percent of n-alkanes and methylnaphthalenes applied to the tissues prior to digestion. Minimum detectable levels for n-alkanes and methylnaphthalenes were approximately 0.08 to 0.15 and 0.03 to 0.04 ug/g of wet tissue, respectively.",

Dodecane is a component of gasoline and is used as solvent, in organic synthesis, in jet fuel research, as a distillation chaser, and in the rubber and paper processing industries. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Dodecane may be harmful if inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin. It can be irritating to mucous membranes. ANIMAL STUDIES: Dodecane, can produce slight to severe dermal irritation and respiratory in animals. However, it produced only minimal to negligible ocular irritation. Rats exposed to inhalation to 0.2 mL dodecane died within 24 hours of progressive edema and hemorrhaging. Dodecane did not show any effects, including no central nervous system depression, when rats were exposed at the saturated vapor concentrations. Dodecane, applied topically to progeny of rats treated with benzo(a)pyrene, chrysene, or benzo(b)triphenylene on gestation day 1, produced tumors in offspring. Dodecane has been shown to be a promoter of skin carcinogenesis for ultraviolet radiation. Dodecane, did not produce an increase in mutations when tested in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium assay with and without of metabolic activation. However, Dodecane was able to enhance mutagenesis induced by methylazoxymethanol acetate at the ouabain resistance locus.",

The present study is an ongoing approach to assess the dose-related percutaneous absorption of a number of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. The first treatment (1X) was comprised of mixtures containing undecane (4.1%), dodecane (4.7%), tridecane (4.4%), tetradecane (3%), pentadecane (1.6%), naphthalene (1.1%), and dimethyl naphthalene (1.3% of jet fuels) in hexadecane solvent using porcine skin flow through diffusion cell. Other treatments (n=4 cells) were 2X and 5X concentrations. Perfusate samples were analyzed with gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) using head space solid phase micro-extraction fiber technique. We have standardized the assay to have a good linear correlation for all the tested components in media standards. Absorption parameters including diffusivity, permeability, steady state flux, and percent dose absorbed were estimated for all the tested hydrocarbons. This approach provides a baseline to access component interactions among themselves and with the diluent (solvents). A quantitative structure permeability relationship (QSPR) model was derived to predict the permeability of unknown jet fuel hydrocarbons in this solvent system by using their physicochemical parameters. Our findings suggested a dose related increase in absorption for naphthalene and dimethyl naphthalene (DMN).",

In order to delineate the toxicological interactions among individual hydrocarbons in a mixture and their contributions to cutaneous toxicity, nine ALI and five ARO hydrocarbons were each divided into five (high/medium/low cytotoxic and strong/weak IL-8 induction) groups and intra/inter-mixed to assess for their mixture effects on HEK mortality and IL-8 release. Addition of single hydrocarbon to JP-8 fuel was also evaluated for their changes in fuel dermatotoxicity. The results indicated that when hydrocarbons were mixed, HEK mortality and IL-8 release were not all predictable by their individual ability affecting these two parameters. The lowest HEK mortality (7%) and the highest IL-8 production were induced with mixtures including high cytotoxic and weak IL-8 inductive ARO hydrocarbons. Antagonistic reactions not consistently correlated with ALI carbon chain length and ARO structure were evident and carried different weight in the overall mixture toxicities. Single addition of benzene, toluene, xylene or ethylbenzene for up to tenfold in JP-8 did not increase HEK mortality while single addition of ALI hydrocarbons exhibited dose-related differential response in IL-8. In an all ALI environment, no single hydrocarbon is the dominating factor in the determination of HEK cytotoxicity while deletion of hexadecane resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in IL-8 production. Overall, decane, undecane and dodecane were the major hydrocarbons associated with high cytotoxicity while tetradecane, pentadecane and hexadecane were those which had the greatest buffering effect attenuating dermatotoxicity. The mixture effects must be considered when evaluating jet fuel toxicity to HEK.",

In order to elucidate the dermatotoxicity of a complex mixture like jet fuels, structural differences, exposure time and dosage were investigated on HEK toxicity assessed by mortality and IL-8 release. ALI and ARO hydrocarbons were grouped into 4 categories: highly cytotoxic (octane, nonane, decane for aliphatics and cyclohexalbenzene, trimethylbenzene, xylene for aromatics), low cytotoxic (tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane for aliphatics and benzene for aromatics), high IL-8 release (decane, undecane, dodecane for aliphatics and dimethylnapthalene, cyclohexylbenzene, ethylbenzene for aromatics) and low IL-8 release (tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane for aliphatics and benzene, toluene, xylene for aromatics). The 4 categories of ALI hydrocarbons were mixed with each other, or cross-mixed with each of the 4 categories of ARO hydrocarbons. The resulting cytotoxicity and IL-8 production from HEK were evaluated at 24 hr. The results showed an antagonistic cytotoxic effect between ALI and ARO hydrocarbons in which ALI attenuated the degree of HEK mortality caused by the ARO hydrocarbons. On the other hand, the ARO hydrocarbons reduced the significant increase of IL-8 induced by ALI hydrocarbons. Synergistic effects between low IL-8 inductive and low cytotoxic hydrocarbons were found and the highest cytotoxic and IL-8 inductive responses did not completely correspond to the mixture of highly cytotoxic and highly IL-8 inductive hydrocarbons. This study supports the concept that the ARO dictate the degree of HEK mortality, while the ALI are the major contributor to inciting the proinflammatory response. Mixture effects must be considered when evaluating cytotoxicity to HEK.",

Maintain an open airway and assist ventilation if necessary. Administer supplemental oxygen. Monitor arterial blood gases or oximetry, chest radiographs, and ECG and admit symptomatic patients to an intensive care setting. Use epinephrine and other beta-adrenergic medications with caution in patients with significant hydrocarbon intoxication because arrhythmias may be induced. 2. Pulmonary aspiration. Patients who remain completely asymptomatic after 4-6 hours of observation may be discharged. In contrast, if the patient is coughing on arrival, aspiration probably has occurred. Administer supplemental oxygen and treat bronchospasm and hypoxia if they occur. Do not use steroids or prophylactic antibiotics. 3. Ingestion. In the vast majority of accidental childhood ingestions, less than 5-10 mL is actually swallowed and systemic toxicity is rare. Treatment is primarily supportive. Injection. For injections into the fingertip or hand, especially those involving a high-pressure paint gun, consult with a plastic or hand surgeon immediately, as prompt wide exposure, irrigation, and debridement are often required. /Hydrocarbons/",

In order to elucidate the dermatotoxicity of a complex mixture like jet fuels, structural differences, exposure time and dosage were investigated on HEK toxicity assessed by mortality and IL-8 release. ALI and ARO hydrocarbons were grouped into 4 categories: highly cytotoxic (octane, nonane, decane for aliphatics and cyclohexalbenzene, trimethylbenzene, xylene for aromatics), low cytotoxic (tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane for aliphatics and benzene for aromatics), high IL-8 release (decane, undecane, dodecane for aliphatics and dimethylnapthalene, cyclohexylbenzene, ethylbenzene for aromatics) and low IL-8 release (tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane for aliphatics and benzene, toluene, xylene for aromatics). The 4 categories of ALI hydrocarbons were mixed with each other, or cross-mixed with each of the 4 categories of ARO hydrocarbons. The resulting cytotoxicity and IL-8 production from HEK were evaluated at 24 hr. The results showed an antagonistic cytotoxic effect between ALI and ARO hydrocarbons in which ALI attenuated the degree of HEK mortality caused by the ARO hydrocarbons. On the other hand, the ARO hydrocarbons reduced the significant increase of IL-8 induced by ALI hydrocarbons. Synergistic effects between low IL-8 inductive and low cytotoxic hydrocarbons were found and the highest cytotoxic and IL-8 inductive responses did not completely correspond to the mixture of highly cytotoxic and highly IL-8 inductive hydrocarbons. This study supports the concept that the ARO dictate the degree of HEK mortality, while the ALI are the major contributor to inciting the proinflammatory response. Mixture effects must be considered when evaluating cytotoxicity to HEK.",

In order to delineate the toxicological interactions among individual hydrocarbons in a mixture and their contributions to cutaneous toxicity, nine ALI and five ARO hydrocarbons were each divided into five (high/medium/low cytotoxic and strong/weak IL-8 induction) groups and intra/inter-mixed to assess for their mixture effects on HEK mortality and IL-8 release. Addition of single hydrocarbon to JP-8 fuel was also evaluated for their changes in fuel dermatotoxicity. The results indicated that when hydrocarbons were mixed, HEK mortality and IL-8 release were not all predictable by their individual ability affecting these two parameters. The lowest HEK mortality (7%) and the highest IL-8 production were induced with mixtures including high cytotoxic and weak IL-8 inductive ARO hydrocarbons. Antagonistic reactions not consistently correlated with ALI carbon chain length and ARO structure were evident and carried different weight in the overall mixture toxicities. Single addition of benzene, toluene, xylene or ethylbenzene for up to tenfold in JP-8 did not increase HEK mortality while single addition of ALI hydrocarbons exhibited dose-related differential response in IL-8. In an all ALI environment, no single hydrocarbon is the dominating factor in the determination of HEK cytotoxicity while deletion of hexadecane resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in IL-8 production. Overall, decane, undecane and dodecane were the major hydrocarbons associated with high cytotoxicity while tetradecane, pentadecane and hexadecane were those which had the greatest buffering effect attenuating dermatotoxicity. The mixture effects must be considered when evaluating jet fuel toxicity to HEK.",

We tested the health effects of emissions from vehicles exposed to \"parked in sunshine\" conditions. A new and a 3-year-old vehicle with identical interior were exposed to 14 000 W of light. Indoor air was analyzed by GC-MS. Toxicity of extracts of indoor air was assayed in human primary keratinocytes, human lung epithelial A549 cell line, and Chinese hamster V79 lung fibroblasts. In addition, toxicity after metabolic activation by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and CYP2E1 was assayed. The effect on type I allergic reaction (IgE-mediated immune response), type IV allergic reaction (T-cell mediated immune response), and irritative potential was evaluated also. A total of 10.9 and 1.2 mg/cu m VOC were found in new and used motor vehicle indoor air, respectively. The major compounds in the new vehicle were o,m,p-xylenes, C3 and C4-alkylbenzenes, dodecane, tridecane, and methylpyrrolidinone. In the used vehicle they were acetone, methylpyrrolidinone, methylcyclohexane, acetaldehyde, o,m,p-xylenes, ethylhexanol, and toluene. No toxicity was observed in any cell line with or without metabolic activation. Neither did we find an effect on type IV sensitization or an irritative potential. A slight but statistically significant aggravating effect on IgE-mediated immune response of only the new vehicle indoor air was determined (p<0.05). The IgE-response modulating effect of indoor air might be relevant for atopic individuals. Else no direct toxicity, no toxicity after metabolic activation by cytochrome P450, and no irritative or type IV sensitizing potential of motor vehicle indoor air were found, neither from the new nor used vehicle. Our investigations indicated no apparent health hazard of parked motor vehicle indoor air.",

Microdialysis probes were inserted into dermis in the dorsal skin of hairless rats. After 2 hr of probes insertion, occlusive dermal exposure (2 hr) was carried out with 230 uL of nonane, dodecane and tetradecane, using Hill top chambers((R)). Inflammatory biomarkers such as substance P (SP), alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) were analyzed in the dialysis samples by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). SP, alpha-MSH and IL6 were released in significant amounts following the dermal exposure of nonane and dodecane, whereas tetradecane did not induce any of these markers in significant amounts compared to control. Nonane increased the PGE(2) levels in significant amounts within 2 hr of chemical exposure compared to dodecane and tetradecane. IL-6 response was found to be slow and 2-3-fold increase in IL-6 levels was observed after 5 hr following nonane and dodecane application. The magnitude of skin irritation exerted by all three chemicals was in the order of nonane>or=dodecane>or=tetradecane. The results demonstrate that microdialysis can be used to measure the inflammatory biomarkers in the skin irritation studies and irritation response of chemicals was quantifiable by this method. In conclusion, microdialysis was found to be an excellent tool to measure several inflammatory biomarkers as a function of time after dermal exposures with irritant chemicals.",

Acute oral LD50 values exceeded the limit dose tested. However, n-decane and presumably the other materials in this category can cause chemical pneumonitis if ingested material is aspirated into the lung. ... With one exception in which a single death occurred in animals treated with C10-C13 alkanes ..., no mortality was observed in any of the studies at the highest dose tested. Clinical signs reported in some studies following treatment included soft stool, ano-genital staining, piloerection, alopecia, and unthrifty coat. The acute oral LD50 values for decane and undecane were reported to be >5 g/kg ...  and >2 g/kg ..., respectively. No acute oral data were available on dodecane. However, considering that the oral LD50 values for the other members of the category and tetradecane ..., as well as the complex C10-C13, C12-C14, and C14-C17 alkane mixtures ... range from >2 g/kg to >5 g/kg, suggests it is reasonable to anticipate that the oral LD50 of dodecane would not vary significantly from that of the other members of the category.",

Dodecane's production and use as a solvent in organic synthesis, distillation chaser, in jet fuel research and in the rubber and paper processing industries may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. Dodecane is a component of gasoline. The compound occurs in the paraffin fraction of petroleum and is a component of petroleum oils and tars. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.135 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dodecane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dodecane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.8 days. Dodecane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dodecane is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4800. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.2 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Dodecane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. According to the Japanese MITI test, dodecane is considered readily biodegradable based on results of analogous chemicals indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, dodecane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 32 days if adsorption is considered. Reported BCF values of 53 to <240 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to dodecane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dodecane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dodecane via inhalation of automobiloe exhaust, ambient air, wood smoke and ingestion of food. (SRC)",

Dodecane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.2 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.135 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 3.7X10-3 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hrs and 5 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 32 days if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values of 53(8) to <240(9) suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high(SRC). According to the Japanese MITI test, dodecane is considered readily biodegradable based on results of analogous chemicals(10) indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

In a study of soil spiked with JP-4 jet fuel, the concentration of dodecane on day 1, 5, 10 and 15 was determined to be 0.111, 0.056, 0.016, and 0.014 ug/mL in untreated soil extract and 0.104, 0.056, 0.015, and 0.017 ug/mL in sterile soil extract; it was concluded that biodegradation contributed to the removal of the higher molecular weight fraction of jet fuel from soil(2). During a simple microcosm/respirometric test, dodecane was degraded 32.6% (as a measure of %ThoD) after the first addition to rangeland silt loam and 32.0% after the second addition. In forest silt loam, dodecane degraded 42.2% and 35.1%(3). A mixture of normal alkanes that included dodecane were degraded to <5% of the initial concentration in hydrocarbon contaminated sediments of Patagonia, Argentina while the sterile control was degraded by 5-10%(4). Dodecane in jet fuels applied to soil cores and subjected to simulated rain had disappeared when tested after 131 days(5). Dodecane, present as 4.61% of a vapor mixture of 13 typical petroleum hydrocarbons, exhibited a first-order degradation rate coefficient of 2.08/day using an unsaturated sandy soil under field conditions at the Airbase Verlose, Denmark, incubated for 30 days(6).",

Loss of 21 and 87% of dodecane was observed within 16 and 49 days, respectively, from 1 mL of crude oil added to a 100 mL seawater solution collected at Fukae of Kobe harbor, Japan and incubated at 20 \u00b0C(1). Dodecane, present as a component of biodiesel B20 fuel (20% soybean fatty acid methyl esters, 80% petroleum diesel), exhibited a half-life of 2.1 days using unacclimated inocula from a rainwater retention pond in a river die-away test. The overall median half-life of 100 ppm biodiesel B20 was determined to by 6.8 days(2). Bacteria from Colgate Creek sediment cultured in water from both Colgate Creek and Eastern Bay in Chesapeake Bay, MD were able to utilize 17-27% and 7-24%, respectively, of the dodecane from a petroleum hydrocarbon mixture after 28 days incubation at 20 \u00b0C(3). In a mesocosm experiment which simulated seasonal conditions in Narragansett Bay, RI, the half-life for dodecane was 1.1, 0.7, and 3.6 days under spring, summer and winter conditions, respectively; under summer conditions the half-life was tripled when mercury-chloride was added to eliminate biodegradation(4). The degradation proceeded without any lag and mineralization was rapid(4). 40 and 46% degradation occurred when dodecane was exposed to microorganisms from polluted estuarine water and oil-rich sediment, respectively, from the Chesapeake Bay for an unspecified time period. Less degradation of dodecane occurred in less contaminated oil and water(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that dodecane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 4 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 32 days if adsorption is considered(4). Dodecane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Dodecane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

Air pollution measurements taken from the Craeybeckx highway tunnel in Antwerp, Belgium during April 1991 were found to contain dodecane concentrations ranging from 0.033 to 0.059 g/kg(2). Data from Sept 2 1979 identified dodecane as a gaseous emission of the vehicle traffic through the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel of the Pennsylvania Turnpike(3). Data from Aug 25 to Sept 7 1979 showed for a speed of 80 km/hr on straight and level highway, gasoline powered vehicles emitted dodecane at an average rate of 1.8 mg/km and diesel trucks emitted dodecane at an average of 17.1 mg/km(4). Dodecane (diesel fuel composition = 15,500 ug/g) was detected in the tail-pipe emissions of late-model medium duty diesel trucks at an emission of 503 ug/km. The study used a two-stage dilution source sampling system and the trucks were driven using the hot-start Federal Test Procedure (FTP) urban driving cycle(5). During a similar study using gasoline (dodecane composition = 136 ug/g) with automobiles and light-duty trucks, dodecane was detected in tail-pipe emissions of catalyst-equipped gas-powered vehicles at 83.9 ug/km and 1,770 ug/km in non-catalyst equipped motor vehicles(6). A dodecane emission factor of 6.2 mg/km was reported for gas-powered vehicles traveling through the Maria Maluf Tunnel (carries light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty diesel trucks) in Sao Paulo, Brazil, sampled in May 2004(7).",

The study sampled four manufactured houses, which were manufactured in July 1997 in Florida and constructed three weeks later and seven site built houses which were sampled between 1997 and 1998 one to two months after completion(1). Mean dodecane levels were found to be 6.9 and 2.5 ug/cu m in 22 non-complaint (61 samples) and 5 complaint (11 samples) buildings, respectively, following air sampling of 27 new and established dwellings in suburban Melbourne, Australia; the mean outdoor concentration was 0.9 ug/cu m(2).",

In this study, dodecane was detected in emissions of furniture coatings 7 times out of 17 during chamber screening tests(1). The mean emission rate of dodecane from plywood with a polyurethane lacquer layer was determined to be 0.13 mg/m/hr(2). Dodecane was identified but not quantified in the emissions from 17 new carpet cushions tested between February and September, 1993(3). Dodecane concentrations ranged from 5.6-63.8 ng/L at 25-71 \u00b0C, as a volatile component from 10 tufted-textile floor coverings with a styrene-butadiene rubber backing, used in Europe(4). The emission rate for dodecane from an idle dry-process photocopy machine and from a printing photocopy machine was determined to be 54 and 960 ug/hour, respectively(5). Dodecane was identified on particulate fiber as a byproduct of the incomplete combustion of the field burning of agricultural plastic, concentration not specified(6). Dodecane was present at 989.9 and 33.6 ug/cu m in the cabin air of parked new and 3 yr-old cars, respectively, with identical interiors(7).",

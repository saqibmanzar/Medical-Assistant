When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Herein, a nano-sized (100-300 nm), dual perfluorocarbon (decafluorobutane/dodecafluoropentane) droplet that is stable, is sufficiently small to extravasate, and is convertible to micron-sized bubbles upon acoustic activation was investigated. Microbubbles and nanodroplets were incorporated into tissue-mimicking acrylamide-albumin phantoms. Microbubbles or nanodroplets at 0.1 x 10(6) per cu cm resulted in mean lesion volumes of 80.4 +/- 33.1 cu mm and 52.8 +/- 14.2 cu mm (mean +/- s.e.), respectively, after 20 s of continuous 1 MHz HIFU at a peak negative pressure of 4MPa, compared to a lesion volume of 1.0 +/- 0.8 cu mm in agent-free control phantoms. Magnetic resonance thermometry mapping during HIFU confirmed undesired surface heating in phantoms containing microbubbles, whereas heating occurred at the acoustic focus of phantoms containing the nanodroplets. Maximal change in temperature at the target site was enhanced by 16.9% and 37.0% by microbubbles and nanodroplets, respectively. This perfluorocarbon nanodroplet has the potential to reduce the time to ablate tumors by one-third during focused ultrasound surgery while also safely enhancing thermal deposition at the target site.",

Seventy-one patients undergoing prostate biopsy received intravenous injection of perflubutane microbubbles (Sonazoid). We evaluated and compared images obtained by CEUS. The safety observation period was 2 days after contrast administration. Among the 30 patients with cancer, one or more sites with findings suggestive of cancer in CEUS were detected in 23 patients (32.4%) by TBx. Although 22 patients had positive cores of cancer by systematic biopsy (SBx), 8 patients had positive cores of cancer in TBx alone (11.3%). There was a significant difference in cancer detection rate by TBx between two cohorts with PSA < 10 ng/mL (22.9%) and PSA /greater than or equal to/ 10 ng/mL (52.2%) (P < 0.02). Close observation of various CEUS findings with Sonazoid enabled targeting of cancerous areas, and consequently, a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the detection rate of cancer was recognized in the transition zone (TZ): SBx; 21/120 (17.5%) and TBx; 17/55 (30.9%). The incidence of adverse events was 6.7% and that of adverse reactions was 4%. CEUS with Sonazoid improved the detection rate of PCa by visualizing cancerous lesions. More detailed examination of CEUS images provided efficient characterization especially in the TZ area. TBx according to this procedure is expected to enable a lower number of biopsies and more accurate diagnosis of PCa.",

No differences were observed between genders or doses for any of the pharmacokinetic parameters. For all tissues, the highest concentrations were observed at the first time point (i.e., 5 min postinjection) (51% of injected dose in liver; total recovery of 69%). The highest concentrations of PFB in tissue were observed in spleen > liver > lung > kidney >> other tissues. At 24 hr after dosing, the total amount of PFB remaining in the tissues was 1.9%. These data fit well with the finding that after a Sonazoid dose of 8 microL microbubbles/kg to male rats, more than 50% of the injected PFB was recovered in exhaled air by 20 min after dosing. During the first 24 hr after administration, more than 96% of the PFB dose was recovered in exhaled air.",

Blood and tissue samples collected at specified times were analyzed for palladium by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). AI-700 was also administered intravenously to rats (40 mg microspheres/kg) and expired air was collected over time. Expired air samples were analyzed for DFB by validated adsorbent trapping-thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methodology. Pd from [Pd]-AI-700 was cleared from blood with a ca. 50-85% decline from peak concentration within 5 min. At 1440 min post-dose, 52-72% of the Pd dose was recovered from organs of the reticuloendothelial system. Approximately 77% of the intravenously injected DFB was found in expired air within 3h after dosing, with most of the DFB dose (61+/-6%) expired within the first 10 min after dosing. As expected, the microspheres were cleared through the reticuloendothelial system, and the DFB was eliminated in expired air, with more than half of the DFB eliminated within the first 10 min after dosing.",

Expired air and blood samples were collected from 32 subjects and perfluorobutane (PFB) gas was analyzed using validated gas chromatography mass spectrometry methods. Blood concentrations of PFB declined biphasicly with a distribution half-life (t(0.5 to 15)) of 2 to 3 min and an elimination half-life (t(15 to 120)) of 30 to 45 min. Area under the curve (AUC) values in patients with impaired gas diffusion were significantly larger than those in healthy volunteers. The exhalation kinetics were somewhat variable with a PFB elimination half-life (t(15 to 120)) of 28 to 111 min. Clearance of PFB was independent of study population and mode of administration. There were no deaths and no serious adverse events that resulted in the withdrawal of a subject from the study. With the exception that arthralgia predominated in healthy volunteers, healthy volunteers and diseased subjects did not show a different adverse event profile whether Sonazoid was administered as a bolus injection or as an infusion. Assessment of laboratory parameters (serum biochemistry, hematology and urinalysis), vital signs, oxygen saturation and electrocardiograms (ECGs) showed no changes which caused safety concern.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Phase-change contrast agents (PCCAs) have been proposed as a means to overcome this limitation, since droplets formed in the hundred nanometer size range might be able to extravasate through leaky microvasculature, after which they could be activated to form larger highly echogenic microbubbles. Existing PCCAs in the sub-micron size range require substantial acoustic energy to be vaporized, increasing the likelihood of unwanted bioeffects. Thus, there exists a need for PCCAs with reduced acoustic activation energies for use in imaging studies. In this article, it is shown that decafluorobutane, which is normally a gas at room temperature, can be incorporated into metastable liquid sub-micron droplets with appropriate encapsulation methods. The resulting droplets are activatable with substantially less energy than other favored PCCA compounds. Decafluorobutane nanodroplets may present a new means to safely extend ultrasound imaging beyond the vascular space.",

PSE is a novel technique for evaluating myocardial perfusion. RAMP (real-time assessment of myocardial perfusion)-1 and -2 were international, Phase 3 trials that evaluated the ability of PSE with Imagify, to detect CAD. Chronic, stable, chest pain patients (n=662) underwent Imagify PSE and gated SPECT imaging at rest and during dipyridamole stress. Independent blinded cardiologists [three PSE readers per trial, and four SPECT readers (one for RAMP-1, three for RAMP-2)] interpreted images. CAD was defined by quantitative coronary angiography or 90-day outcome with clinical review. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were evaluated using non-inferiority analysis (one-sided alpha=0.025) compared with SPECT. SPECT results for RAMP-1 and -2 were: accuracy (70%, 67%), sensitivity (78%, 61%), and specificity (64%, 76%). Accuracy of all six PSE readers was non-inferior to SPECT (66-71%, P<or=0.004). Four demonstrated non-inferior sensitivity (68-77%, P<or=0.002), three demonstrated non-inferior specificity (72-88%, P<or=0.013). Three PSE readers (RAMP-2) were superior for sensitivity. Two PSE readers (RAMP-1) were superior for specificity. Area under the multi-reader receiver operating characteristics curve (0.72) was equal for both modalities. Majority of adverse events followed dipyridamole dosing, and were mild, transient, and required no treatment. Imagify PSE was well-tolerated. Its diagnostic performance in chest pain patients is comparable with SPECT perfusion imaging.",

It is used as a medical research chemical, and as an ultrasound contrast agent. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Seventy-one patients undergoing prostate biopsy received intravenous injection of perfluorobutane microbubbles (Sonazoid). The safety observation period was 2 days after contrast administration. The incidence of adverse events was 6.7% and that of adverse reactions was 4%. ANIMAL STUDIES: Single intravenous administration of gas-carrier contrast agents used in ultrasound imaging to mice caused inflammation, necrosis, and ulceration of cecum and proximal colon (cecocolonic area) and focal necrosis in the liver. Similar intestinal lesions were also found in rats after treatment with a single iv administration of a gas-carrier contrast agent. No intestinal or hepatic lesions were found in guinea pigs or rabbits after repeated intravenous administrations of Sonazoid. In dogs, minimal to mild granulocytic inflammation of the cecum and/or colon was found after daily repeated intravenous injections for 28 days, but not after daily repeated administration for 14 days nor after a single administration. It is proposed that the intestinal and hepatic lesions in rats and mice after a single intravenous injection of gas-carrier contrast agents are caused by a common mechanism: intravascular growth of gas-carrier agents in tissues with gas supersaturation, as occurs in the cecal wall of rats and mice. In this particular environment the growing gas bubbles cause ischemia and necrosis in the cecal and colonic wall and liver.",

Similar intestinal lesions were also found in rats after treatment with a single iv administration of a gas-carrier contrast agent. Strain differences in the incidences of these lesions were found in both rats and mice. HsdHan:NMRI mice were among the most sensitive of the strains of mice studied. Even at the lowest dose of Sonazoid technically possible to inject in HsdHan:NMRI mice, lesions were found and a no-effect dose could not be determined. In a time-course experiment in HsdHan:NMRI mice, it was found that the lesions began to develop in the cecum and colon within 15 to 30 min after dosing. Lesions in the liver were first observed 120-240 min after dosing. Diet played a role in the etiology of the lesions, as HsdHan:NMRI mice given a diet with reduced amounts of cellulose and starch had reduced incidences of lesions, and when glucose was the only carbohydrate source, no lesions were observed. No intestinal or hepatic lesions were found in guinea pigs or rabbits after repeated intravenous administrations of Sonazoid. In dogs, minimal to mild granulocytic inflammation of the cecum and/or colon was found after daily repeated intravenous injections for 28 days, but not after daily repeated administration for 14 days nor after a single administration. It is proposed that the intestinal and hepatic lesions in rats and mice after a single intravenous injection of gas-carrier contrast agents are caused by a common mechanism: intravascular growth of gas-carrier agents in tissues with gas supersaturation, as occurs in the cecal wall of rats and mice. In this particular environment the growing gas bubbles cause ischemia and necrosis in the cecal and colonic wall and liver. This proposed mechanism of action is consistent with the absence of clinical reports indicative of intestinal and/or hepatic lesions in humans after administration of gas-carrier contrast agents.",

Sonazoid (0.3 x 10+9 microbubbles in 0.5 mL) was observed by intravital microscopy in the cremaster muscle after retrograde administration into the femoral artery of 6 animals. Microbubble and microvessel diameters and blood flow velocities and the overall mean and SD of the 1-minute volume flow through the microscopic field were calculated from the 2 to 4 capillaries observed in the field of each animal. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran leakage was used to assess extravasation after microbubble passage seconds, respectively, before they were released and capillary flow normalized. No microbubble size changes, damming, or coalescence of bubbles and no changes in microvessel diameter or microvascular blood flow velocities, volume flow, or perfusion heterogeneity occurred during or after the passage of the Sonazoid suspension or the vehicle. No fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran leakage was observed. Conclusions. The passage of Sonazoid bubbles at concentrations higher than those expected after intravenous administration of the Sonazoid did not durably impair microvascular perfusion, structural integrity, or macromolecular retention in the rat cremaster muscle. The duration of discrete capillary obstructions was short and in all cases comparable with that of naturally occurring leukocyte plugging.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2010 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates perfluorobutane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase perfluorobutane has an estimated atmospheric life-time of >2600 years. Perfluorobutane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, perfluorobutane is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3960. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 670 atm-cu m/mole. Perfluorobutane will volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, perfluorobutane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.5 hours and 6 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 32 days when adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 94 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to perfluorobutane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where perfluorobutane is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may have limited exposure to perfluorobutane via medical procedures. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 670 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.5 hours and 6 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 32 days when adsorption is considered(4). Perfluorobutane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 94(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 3.49(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

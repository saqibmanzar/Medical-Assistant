When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In rats exposed by inhalation, the percentage of a dose of the acrylate excreted in urine as thioethers over 24 hr was dose dependent and decreased from 8.0 to 3.0% as the 6 hr exposure concentration in air increased from 250 to 1000 mg/cu m, indicating saturable metabolism along this pathway. A decrease in the number of non-protein SH groups was also observed in the blood and liver of these animals.",

The chemical was administered by iv or ip injection at a dose of 10 mg/kg, and the animals were maintained in metabolism cages until sacrifice at 1, 2, 12, and 24 hr post dosing. A biexponential elimination of radioactivity was observed in both 4 and 7 month old male animals following the administration of labeled 2EHA through iv or ip routes. The half lives of the slow and fast phases of elimination were 5-6 hr and 30-60 min in the younger animals and 14 hr and 115-130 min in the older animals respectively. The rank order of tissue concentrations of 2EHA following iv dosing was kidney, liver, brain, thymus, spleen, lungs, heart, testes, blood, fat. Tissue levels of the acrylate were lower following ip administration, but followed a similar pattern. The major routes of elimination during the first 12 hours after both dosing regimen was expired air and urinary excretion. Expired air accounted for approximately 50% of the radioactivity administered at 24 hr post treatment with another 7-13% determined in the urine. Trapping the exhaled radioactivity in 2 molar sodium-hydroxide and gas chromatographic analysis revealed that the primary metabolite was carbon-dioxide.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The 6-hr inhalation of acrylonitrile (AN), methyl acrylate (MA), ethyl acrylate (EA), n-butyl acrylate (BA) and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (2-EHA) in several concentrations increased the urinary thioether excretion; the portion metabolized to thioethers was... only 1.5-8% for the acrylates. Total-SH levels in the liver significantly decreased after the inhalation of AN, EA, BA and 2-EHA. ...Most pronounced NP-SH depletion was in the liver, less in blood and moderate in brain and lungs. There was an exponential relationship between the tissue NP-SH and the inhaled concentrations. Calculated concentrations inducing 50% NP-SH depletion indicated that reaction of acrylic acid derivatives with SH groups was decreasing in the order AN >>2-EHA >EA = BA for the chemicals and liver >blood >lungs >brain for the tissues. All inhaled acrylates induced hyperglycemia... . The chemical reactivity of acrylates with glutathione (GSH) decreased in the order EA >BA >MA >AN >2-EHA. The results suggest that GSH depletion may participate in acute lethal and biochemical toxic effects of acrylic acid esters.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

For comparison, two esters of acrylic-acid, butyl-acrylate and 2-ethylhexyl-acrylate were also tested. Guinea-pigs were treated with injection or application of the solutions on 3 days of 3 successive weeks. After 10 days of no treatment, animals received challenge doses and were examined at 1, 24, and 48 hours for signs of sensitization reaction, including intense redness, wheals, or both. Albino-rabbits, albino-guinea-pigs, hairless-mice, and albino-rats were exposed to solutions either inside an impermeable covering or treated with free access to the atmosphere to assess dermatitis due to primary irritant effects. Versatic-9-11-acid and its monoglycidyl ester produced no signs of sensitization reaction, while both acrylates and the vinyl ester produced some signs of sensitization, including intense redness and edema. For rabbits, the acrylates were more irritating than the versatic derivatives, although the vinyl ester caused considerable irritation which was more persistent than that caused by the acrylates. Results with guinea-pigs were similar to those for rabbits. Signs of irritation were seen on mice with butyl-acrylate and the vinyl ester, but not with the other materials. Rats showed some irritation with the use of the two acrylates and the vinyl ester.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.178 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-ethylhexyl acrylate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-ethylhexyl acrylate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 hours. The half-life for the reaction of vapor-phase 2-ethylhexyl acrylate with ozone is estimated to be 6.5 days. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight, since it does not contain functional groups that are expected to absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm. If released to soil, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 430. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.000432 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate was found to biodegrade 51 to >90% in biodegradation screening tests. Data regarding the biodegradation of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate in either soil or aquatic systems were not available. If released into water, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 hours and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 280 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not altered physically or chemically once released into the environment. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process for 2-ethylhexyl acrylate only at alkaline pHs, based on hydrolysis data for an analogous compound, ethyl acrylate. The base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant for ethyl acrylate, was reported as 0.078 L/mol-s, which corresponds to half-lives of 3 years, 103 and 10 days at pH 7, 8, and 9, respectively. Occupational exposure to 2-ethylhexyl acrylate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-ethylhexyl acrylate is produced or used. Monitoring data are limited. The general population may be exposed to 2-ethylhexyl acrylate via inhalation of ambient air containing 2-ethylhexyl acrylate from products such as commercial furniture coatings. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 hours and 6 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 280(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 4.09(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC), provided the compound is not altered physically or chemically once released into the environment(SRP). No hydrolysis data are available for 2-ethylhexyl acrylate; however, hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process for 2-ethylhexyl acrylate but only at alkaline pHs(SRC). The base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant for an analogous compound, ethyl acrylate, is reported to be 0.078 L/mol-s(9), which corresponds to half-lives of 3 years, 103 and 10 days at pH 7, 8, and 9, respectively(SRC).

Vapor-phase 2-ethylhexyl acrylate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate with ozone has been estimated as 1.8X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6.5 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(4). 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight, since it does not contain functional groups that are expected to absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

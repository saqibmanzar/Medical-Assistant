PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

It is genotoxic, and some nickel compounds have been shown to promote cell proliferation. Nickel has a high affinity for chromatin proteins, particularly histones and protamines. The complexing of nickel ions with heterochromatin results in a number of alterations including condensation, DNA hypermethylation, gene silencing, and inhibition of histone acetylation, which have been shown to disturb gene expression. Nickel has also been shown to alter several transcription factors, including hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, activating transcription factor, and NF-KB transcription factor. There is also evidence that nickel ions inhibit DNA repair, either by directly inhibiting DNA repair enzymes or competing with zinc ions for binding to zinc-finger DNA binding proteins, resulting in structural changes in DNA that prevent repair enzymes from binding. Nickel ions can also complex with a number of cellular ligands including amino acids, peptides, and proteins resulting in the generation of oxygen radicals, which induce base damage, DNA strand breaks, and DNA protein crosslinks.

There is limited evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of nickel alloys, nickelocene, nickel carbonyl, nickel salts, nickel arsenides, nickel antimonide, nickel selenides and nickel telluride. There is inadequate evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of nickel trioxide, amorphous nickel sulfide and nickel titanate. The Working Group made the overall evaluation on nickel compounds as a group on the basis of the combined results of epidemiological studies, carcinogenicity studies in experimental animals, and several types of other relevant data, supported by the underlying concept that nickel compounds can generate nickel ions at critical sites in their target cells. Overall evaluation: Nickel compounds are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). Metallic nickel is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). /Nickel compounds/",

Male Fischer rats received either Ni alone ip, Zn alone sc, Zn plus Ni, or saline (ip and sc; controls). In the lethality studies, the dose was 115 umol nickel/kg (as nickel) given in multiple doses of 300 umol Zn/kg (as zinc acetate) at -24, 0 and +24 hr relative to Ni (total Zn dose 900 umol/kg) for lethality studies of -24 and 0 hr for studies 24 hr and under in duration (total dose 600 umol/kg). Zn pretreatment significantly increased the 14 day survival of Ni related rats. Zn did not, however, prevent the reduction in weight gain over 2 wk seen with Ni treatment. Histopathologically, at 120 hr following Ni exposure, kidneys in the group receiving Ni alone generally showed moderate nephropathy (multifocal proximal tubule degeneration with necrosis) while in the Zn plus Ni group the nephropathy was generally mild. Zn pretreatment had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of Ni over 24 hr as assessed by urinary excretion, blood levels, or organ distribution. Zn pretreatment also did not alter the subcellular distribution of renal Ni, 6 hr after exposure. Enhanced synthesis of metallothionein did not appear to play a critical role in the reduction of Ni toxicity, since renal concentrations of this metal binding protein, although elevated as compared to controls, were not different in rats receiving Zn and Ni or Zn alone. Zn pretreatment did, however have marked effect on Ni induced hyperglycemia, reducing both the duration and severity of elevated blood glucose levels. Results of this study show that Zn can prevent some of the toxic effects of Ni and that the mechanisms of this action does not appear to involve either metallothionein or alterations in the pharmacokinetics of Ni.",

Cells treated with 10 uM of either nickel subsulfide or nickel sulfate had an approximately 34 fold increase in anchorage independent colonies. Cells treated with the same concentration of nickel acetate showed a 13 fold increase in the frequency of anchorage independence. The chromium compounds lead chromate, potassium dichromate, calcium dichromate and chromic oxide demonstrated dose dependent cytotoxicity and increases in the frequency of anchorage independent colonies ranging from five to 13 fold. The arsenic compounds sodium arsenite and sodium arsenate but not potassium arsenate also increased the number of anchorage independent colonies. The frequency of anchorage independence increased for 11 to 14 days and then decreased.",

Cultures derived from blood samples were treated with nickel acetate and irradiated at 80 centigrays (cGy)/minute. Dosing the cell cultures with nickel-acetate at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 umol failed to increase the frequency of chromosome aberrations or sister chromatid exchanges. Cytotoxic doses of 1000 micromolar nickel-acetate did, however, inhibit mitosis. To elucidate the effect of nickel (7440020) on DNA repair following ionizing radiation, lymphocytes were exposed to varying concentrations of nickel-acetate for 1 hour during the gap 0 phase, followed by irradiation with two doses of gamma rays (75cGy per dose and separated by 60 minutes). This challenge assay resulted in significant dose dependent increases of chromosome rearrangements and reduction of mitotic indices, indicating that nonclastogenic and noncytotoxic doses of nickel were capable of interfering with DNA repair mechanisms following ionizing radiation. Although the cause of the response was not identified in this study, it was proposed that nickel induction of DNA repair processes may be problematic, demonstrating that adaptation may not always be beneficial. The authors conclude that DNA repair problems appear to be one of the mechanisms explaining the carcinogenic effect of nickel.",

Short-term bacterial assays for genotoxic effects were not successful in predicting the carcinogenicity of metal compounds. Some metal compounds cause the induction of lambda prophage in Escherichia coli WP2s (lambda). By far the strongest inducing ability was observed with potassium chromate (K2CrO4), followed by lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) > maganese chloride (MnCl2) > nickel acetate (Ni(OOCCH3)2) > CrCl2 > Na2WO4 > Na2MoO4 > potassium permanganate (KMnO4). With the exception of chromate; long-term exposures in a narrow subtoxic dose range were required in order to demonstrate phage induction.",

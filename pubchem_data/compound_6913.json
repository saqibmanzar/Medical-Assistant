They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.067 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4,6-trimethylaniline will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4,6-trimethylaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.7 hrs. If released to soil, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 198. However, aromatic amines (including anilines) bind to humate found in soil in two phases which could decrease soil movement. Also, a pKa value of 4.38 suggests that 2,4,6-trimethylaniline will partially exist in the protonated form in moist soils and the protonated form of 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is expected to bind strongly to soil surfaces. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is expected to adsorb slightly to sediment and suspended solids in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 11 and 120 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces may be attenuated by adsorption to humate material in the water column. The protonated form of 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is not expected to volatilize from water. An estimated BCF of 25 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 2,4,6-trimethylaniline may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is produced or used. (SRC)",

In a biodegradation study of 2,4,6-trimethylaniline in a mixed domestic/industrial treatment plant, 0-9% degraded at a concentration of 20 mg/l after 6 hours and 25 \u00b0C(3). Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 11 and 120 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces may be attenuated by adsorption to humate material in the water column(6). However, aromatic amines (including anilines) bind to humate found in water in two phases(6). Initially, a rapid, reversible equilibrium is established, which may represent formation of imine linkages with the humate carbonyls(6). Subsequently, there is a slow reaction that is not readily reversed(6). A pKa of 4.38(7) suggests that 2,4,6-trimethylaniline will partially exist in the protonated form in the aqueous environments and the protonated form of 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is not expected to volatilize from water. According to a classification scheme(8), an estimated BCF of 25(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.72(9) and a regression-derived equation(10), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

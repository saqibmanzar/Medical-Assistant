It is also used as a coating in chemical reactions to \"set\" glues, plastics, and adhesives. Because plastics have many uses, MBOCA is widely used. Other names for MBOCA include 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline), methylene-bis-ortho-chloro-aniline, bis-amine, DACPM, MCA, and MOCA.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It is therefore of interest to identify the human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes involved in MOCA N-oxidation, the primary reaction involved in the formation of an electrophilic product. Human liver microsomes were fractionated and MOCA N-oxidation activity was monitored through the procedure. The most active enzyme fraction corresponded to P450 3A4, as determined by immunochemical assays and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Yeast recombinant P450 3A4 also had MOCA N-oxidation activity. Purified human liver P450 2A6 showed catalytic activity; however, anti-P450 2A6 inhibited less than 20% of the microsomal activity while anti-P450 3A4 inhibited up to 75%. Levels of marker activities of both P450 3A4 (nifedipine oxidation) and P450 2A6 (coumarin 7-hydroxylation) were measured in a set of human liver microsomes and both were correlated with MOCA N-oxidation rates. Gestodene and troleandomycin inhibited up to half of the microsomal MOCA N-hydroxylation activity but 7,8-benzoflavone showed only slight inhibition. Anti-P450 3A4 inhibited (up to 80% of) the microsomal transformation of MOCA to a product genotoxic as judged by bacterial SOS response. The work indicates that P450 3A4 makes a major contribution to human liver microsomal MOCA N-oxidation, and P450 2A6 has a minor role. P450 1A2, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of many arylamines, does not contribute to a great extent.",

Here, the arachidonic acid-dependent activation of substrates by human (h)COX-1 and-2 is examined, utilizing recombinant enzymes. The COX-dependent activation of benzidine (BZ), 4-aminobiphenyl, (+)benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol, (+)benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP), and 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) is assessed by means of COX-catalyzed, covalent DNA binding. The hCOX isozymes activated all substrates tested, activation varied from barely detectable for IQ (0.76 and 1.52 pmol bound/mg DNA for COX-1 and -2, respectively) to a high of 65 and 117 pmol bound/mg DNA for COX-1 and -2, respectively, for the activation of MOCA. BZ, which is an excellent peroxidase substrate, did not exhibit high DNA binding levels in hCOX assays and this phenomenon was found to be due to high levels of binding to protein, which effectively competed with the DNA for binding in the assay. The demonstrated ability of the COX enzymes to activate a variety of environmental and dietary carcinogens indicates a potential role for COX in the activation pathway of aromatic and heterocyclic amines and polycyclic hydrocarbons at extra-hepatic sites during early or late stages of carcinogenesis.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected ip with 0.5-50 mg/kg of MBOCA, and male English short hair guinea pigs were injected sc with 4-100 mg/kg of MBOCA. In the same study, treatment of rats with either phenobarbital or beta-naphthaloflavone (BnF) resulted in induction of cytochrome P-450 as evidenced by increased enzymatic activity of two P-450 isozymes. This induction caused increased ortho-hydroxylation of MBOCA that was not statistically significant and resulted in the formation of various metabolites. Two of those MBOCA metabolites, n-hydroxy MBOCA and mononitroso-MBOCA, formed measurable amounts of adducts with both human and rat hemoglobin, while the amount of adducts formed by the parent compound itself was very small. This in vitro binding occurred in a dose-related manner and could by inhibited by cysteine and glutathione but not by oxidized glutathione or methionine. Therefore, the administration of MBOCA to rats resulted in a dose-related formation of hemoglobin adducts that were detectable 24 days after treatment. Similar observations were made in guinea pigs; the life span of MBOCA-hemoglobin adducts followed that of re cells in the guinea pig and was approximately 60-80 days.",

The determination of the covalently bound reaction products to hemoglobin (Hb) has been investigated as a biomonitoring method for occupational exposure to this potential human carcinogen. Initial studies using the 14C-ring-labeled MOCA showed that 24 hr after a single IP dosage to rats (3.74 mumole/kg), 0.08% of the administered dose was adducted to the Hb, and base hydrolysis liberated 38% of the bound radioactivity. The only product released on hydrolysis was the parent diamine. A specific and sensitive assay procedure using capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has been developed for determining the base-released MOCA adduct down to levels of 20 pmole/g Hb. This method has been used to establish a linear dose-response relationship in IP dosed rats between production of the adduct and dose of MOCA (3.74-44.94 mumole/kg). It is proposed to use analysis of the Hb adduct as a dosimeter for industrial workers exposed to MOCA.",

A method utilizing capillary gas chromatography-negative-ion chemical-ionization mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the determination of pentafluoropropionyl (PFP) derivatives of MOCA, released by alkaline hydrolysis from protein adducts and conjugates, was both sensitive and selective. When selected ion monitoring was used, sub-femtomole amounts of PFP-MOCA could be measured. The detection limit for hemoglobin adducts of MOCA was below 10 fmol/g Hb, well below the levels found for occupationally exposed individuals. Capillary GC with electron-capture detection also had the required sensitivity for the determination of MOCA in blood samples, however, the presence of interfering compounds in some samples limited its use. The levels of MOCA in the blood and urine of five individuals who were exposed to MOCA during the manufacture of polyurethane elastomers were determined by the GC-MS method. The MOCA concentrations for the various blood fractions and urine were within the following ranges: hemoglobin adducts, 0.73-43.3 pmol MOCA/g Hb; plasma alkaline hydrolysate, 0.05-22.0 nmol/L; whole blood, 0.13-17.4 nmol/L; urine, 4.5-2390 nmol/L. Because the products of MOCA in the blood reflect metabolic activation of MOCA and integrate exposure over a period of weeks, the use of blood samples for monitoring exposure to MOCA offers advantages over the currently used urinary MOCA measurements.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The analysis of 7,844 urine samples confirmed that after the introduction of biological monitoring it was possible to reduce the urinary MBOCA levels by using effective exposure control and protection in the workplace. The reduced percentage of samples containing >50 ug/L of MBOCA (from 12% in 1985 to 8% in 1990) and increased percentage of urine samples with <25 ug/mL (from 77% in 1985 to 86% in 1990) further supported the importance of biological urinary MBOCA monitoring.",

The beta peak was the more polar of the two, although they possessed similar HPLC thermospray mass spectra. The beta-N-glucuronide was enzymatically synthesized and further characterized by GCMS as a MbOCA monoglucuronide; in addition, it was rapidly hydrolyzed by beta-glucuronidase, whereas the suspected alpha peak was not. Urine from two MbOCA exposed workers was analyzed using the same technique, revealing a set of four peaks, corresponding to the beta-N-glucuronide, a minor labile conjugate, monoacetyl-MbOCA, and free MbOCA.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.9X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.0 hours. Particulate-phase 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 4,4'-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 5700. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 8 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. BCFs of 114-398 in carp suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be important for 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) based on a hydrolysis half-life of >800 years at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) is produced or used. Limited monitoring and use data suggest the general population may be exposed to 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) via inhalation of ambient air, and dermal contact with this compound in the vicinity of production and manufacturing facilities.

Vapor-phase 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.0 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.8X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). 4,4'-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

However, when the same investigators subjected the 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) containing water to a continuous feed activated sludge reactor, 96% of the chemical in the water was removed in 24 hours after 1 week of operation(2). Studies in pure cultures showed 4 major biodegradation products; two were identified as the N-monoacetyl, N,N'-diacetyl derivatives(3). 4,4'-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) is biodegraded to 4,4'-diamino-3,3'-dichlorobenzophenone in non-sterile soil(4). The rate of biodegradation in soil was not determined in part due to the irreversible binding of the chemical to the soil(4). The lack of metabolic conversion in sterile soil, as well as the higher extractable concentration present in sterile vs non-sterile soil indicate that biological degradation is occurring in the soil(4).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5.0 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 4,4'-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) is not expected to undergo hydrolysis based on a hydrolysis half-life of >800 years at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C(2). 4,4'-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). 4,4'-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) reacts with alkoxy radicals in the aqueous phase which would result in an estimated half-life of 39-72 days, assuming a alkoxy radical concentration of 1X10-10 moles/l(4,5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

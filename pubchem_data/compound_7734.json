ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Exposure to this colorless, aromatic-smelling liquid may occur through dermal contact or inhalation at places where it is produced or used as a plasticizer, solvent, chemical intermediate in the manufacture of divinylbenzene, or in powderless etching. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and protective clothing. If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. Contaminated clothing and shoes should be removed at the site.  1,4-Diethylbenzene may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames.  Also, containers of this substance may explode in the heat of a fire. Its heavier-than-air vapor may travel to a source of ignition and flash back, or accumulate to explosive concentrations in confined spaces such as sewers. For fires involving 1,4-diethylbenzene, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or standard foam.  Isolate the area for 1/2 mile in all directions if a tank, rail car, or tank truck is involved in the fire.  Small spills of 1,4-diethylbenzene may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. For a large spill, use water spray to reduce the vapor, and dike far ahead of the spill to prevent runoff.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.03 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,4-diethylbenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,4-diethylbenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. 1,4-Diethylbenzene absorbs light in the environmental UV spectrum, and thus has the potential for direct photolysis. If released to soil, 1,4-diethylbenzene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1600. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.007335 atm-cu m/mole. 1,4-Diethylbenzene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 1,4-diethylbenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Groundwater and marine water grab sample tests suggests that 1,4-diethylbenzene will completely degrade in groundwater and degrade to a lesser extent in marine water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.3 hr and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 530 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 1,4-diethylbenzene may occur through inhalation in the extrusion area of electrical insulation manufacturing plants and via inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,4-diethylbenzene is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 1,4-diethylbenzene via inhalation of ambient air, and dermal contact with this compound and consumer products containing 1,4-diethylbenzene, such as gasoline.

Using this estimated Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.3 hr and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 530(SRC), from its log Kow of 4.45(6), and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Groundwater(10) and marine water grab sample tests(11), in which 1,4-diethylbenzene was a constituent of gas oil mixtures, suggests that 1,4-diethylbenzene will biodegrade in the aquatic environment.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). 1,4-Diethylbenzene's estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

Vulcanization and extrusion operations during rubber and synthetic production with electrical insulation emits 1,4-diethylbenzene to the air(3). 1,4-Diethylbenzene was detected at a concn of 2.0 ug/cu m in a plume at a distance of 1 mile from its source, a General Motors facility located in Janesville, Wisconsin(4). Leachate samples taken from Guelph and Muskoka municipal waste treatment plants in Ontario were tested for 1,4-diethylbenzene and none was detected(5). 1,4-Diethylbenzene was found in unquantified amounts in the effluent sample of a water treatment plant(7). 1,4-Diethylbenzene was detected, but not quantified, as an introduced volatile organic compound in the water of a test stand basin after a four-stroke outboard motor filled with unleaded gasoline was left in operation for 10 minutes(6).",

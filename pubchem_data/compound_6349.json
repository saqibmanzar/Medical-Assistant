PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

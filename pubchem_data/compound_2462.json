PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

However, highly lipophilic ICS accumulate in systemic tissues, which may lead to adverse systemic effects. The accumulation of a new, highly lipophilic ICS, ciclesonide and its active metabolite (des-CIC) has not yet been reported. Here, we have compared tissue accumulation of des-CIC and an ICS of a moderate lipophilicity, budesonide (BUD), after 14 days of once-daily treatment in mice. Single, three or 14 daily doses of [(3) H]-des-CIC or [(3) H]-BUD were administered subcutaneously to male CD1 albino mice, which were killed at 4 hrs, 24 hrs or 5 days after the last dose. Distribution of tissue concentration of radioactivity was studied by quantitative whole-body autoradiography. Pattern of radioactivity distribution across most tissues was similar for both corticosteroids after a single as well as after repeated dosing. However, tissue concentration of radioactivity differed between des-CIC and BUD. After a single dose, concentrations of radioactivity for both corticosteroids were low for most tissues but increased over 14 days of daily dosing. The tissue radioactivity of des-CIC at 24 hrs and 5 days after the 14th dose was 2-3 times higher than that of BUD in majority of tissues. Tissue accumulation, assessed as concentration of tissue radioactivity 5 days after the 14th versus 3rd dose, showed an average ratio of 5.2 for des-CIC and 2.7 for BUD (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, des-CIC accumulated significantly more than BUD. Systemic accumulation may lead to increased risk of adverse systemic side effects during long-term therapy.",

Despite the widespread use of these drugs, approximately 30% of asthma sufferers exhibit some degree of steroid insensitivity or are refractory to inhaled GCs. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is interpatient variability in the clearance of these compounds. The objective of this research is to determine how metabolism of GCs by the CYP3A family of enzymes could affect their effectiveness in asthmatic patients. In this work, the metabolism of four frequently prescribed inhaled GCs, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate, by the CYP3A family of enzymes was studied to identify differences in their rates of clearance and to identify their metabolites. Both interenzyme and interdrug variability in rates of metabolism and metabolic fate were observed. CYP3A4 was the most efficient metabolic catalyst for all the compounds, and CYP3A7 had the slowest rates. CYP3A5, which is particularly relevant to GC metabolism in the lungs, was also shown to efficiently metabolize triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate. In contrast, flunisolide was only metabolized via CYP3A4, with no significant turnover by CYP3A5 or CYP3A7. Common metabolites included 6 Beta-hydroxylation and Delta (6)-dehydrogenation for triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and flunisolide. The structure of Delta (6)-flunisolide was unambiguously established by NMR analysis. Metabolism also occurred on the D-ring substituents, including the 21-carboxy metabolites for triamcinolone acetonide and flunisolide. The novel metabolite 21-nortriamcinolone acetonide was also identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR analysis.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) to establish a mouse model of asthma. The BUD intervention group received aerosol inhalation of BUD dissolved in normal saline 30 minutes before each OVA challenge, while normal saline was used instead of OVA solution in the control group. The pathological changes in the airway were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and Masson staining. The interleukin-13 (IL-13) level in lung homogenate was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA expression of STAT6 and ORMDL3 was measured by RT-PCR.  The asthma group showed more pathological changes in the airway than the control and BUD intervention groups, and the BUD intervention group had reduced pathological changes in the airway compared with the asthma group. The asthma and BUD intervention groups had significantly higher IL-13 levels and mRNA expression of STAT6 and ORMDL3 than the control group (P<0.05), and these indices were significantly higher in the asthma group than in the BUD intervention group (P<0.05). The Pearson correlation analysis showed that STAT6 mRNA expression was positively correlated with ORMDL3 mRNA expression (r=0.676, P=0.032).  STAT6 and ORMDL3 may be involved in the airway remodeling of mice, and BUD can reduce airway remodeling in asthmatic mice, possibly by down-regulating mRNA expression of STAT6 and ORMDL3.",

Glucocorticoids (GCs) may suppress mucus production and diminish the harmful airway obstruction. We investigated the ability of GCs to suppress mRNA expression and protein synthesis of a gene encoding mucin, MUC5AC, induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha in human mucoepidermoid carcinoma (NCI-H292) cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying the suppression.  We determined if GCs such as dexamethasone (DEX), budesonide (BUD), and fluticasone (FP) could suppress MUC5AC production induced by a combination of TGF-alpha and double-strand RNA, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C). MUC5AC mRNA expression and MUC5AC protein production were evaluated. The signaling pathways activated by TGF-alpha and their inhibition by GCs were tested using a phosphoprotein assay and MUC5AC promoter assay. DEX significantly suppressed the expression of MUC5AC mRNA and MUC5AC protein induced by TGF-alpha. The activation of the MUC5AC promoter by TGF-alpha was significantly inhibited by DEX. DEX did not affect activation of downstream pathways of the EGF receptor or mRNA stability of MUC5AC transcripts. DEX, BUD, and FP suppressed MUC5AC protein expression induced by a combination of TGF-alpha and polyI:C in a dose-dependent manner. GCs inhibited MUC5AC production induced by TGF-alpha alone or a combination of TGF-alpha and polyI:C; the repression may be mediated at the transcriptional but not post-transcriptional level.",

The analyte and the IS were extracted from human plasma by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) using ether. Extracted samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to Atmospheric pressure photoionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-APPI-MS/MS). Chromatography was performed isocratically on a C18, 5 um analytical column. The temperature of the autosampler was kept at 6 degrees C and the run time was 4.00 min. A linear calibration curve over the range 7.5-1000 pg ml -1 was obtained and the lowest concentration quantified was 7.5 pg ml-1, demonstrating acceptable accuracy and precision. This analytical method was applied in a relative bioavailability study in order to compare a test budesonide 64 ug/dose nasal spray formulation vs. a reference 64 ug/dose nasal spray formulation (Budecort Aqua) in 48 volunteers of both sexes. The study was conducted in an open randomized two-period crossover design and with a one-week washout period. Plasma samples were obtained over a 14 h interval. Since the 90% CI for both C(max), AUC(last) and AUC(0-inf) were within the 80-125% interval proposed by the Food and Drug Administration and ANVISA, it was concluded that budesonide 64 ug/dose nasal spray was bioequivalent to Budecort Acqua  64 ug/dose nasal spray, according to both the rate and extent of absorption.",

Current treatment of asthma with combinations of inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta2 agonists improves asthma control and reduces exacerbations but what impact this might have on innate anti-viral immunity is unclear. We investigated the in vitro effects of asthma drugs on innate anti-viral immunity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy and asthmatic donors were cultured for 24 hours with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist, imiquimod, or rhinovirus 16 (RV16) in the presence of budesonide and/or formoterol. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and expression of anti-viral intracellular signalling molecules were measured by ELISA and RT-PCR respectively. In PBMC from healthy donors, budesonide alone inhibited IP-10 and IL-6 production induced by imiquimod in a concentration-dependent manner and the degree of inhibition was amplified when budesonide and formoterol were used in combination. Formoterol alone had little effect on these parameters, except at high concentrations (10-6 M) when IL-6 production increased. In RV16 stimulated PBMC, the combination of budesonide and formoterol inhibited IFN? and IP-10 production in asthmatic as well as healthy donors. Combination of budesonide and formoterol also inhibited RV16-stimulated expression of the type I IFN induced genes myxovirus protein A and 2', 5' oligoadenylate synthetise. Notably, RV16 stimulated lower levels of type Myxovirus A and oligoadenylate synthase in PBMC of asthmatics than control donors. These in vitro studies demonstrate that combinations of drugs commonly used in asthma therapy inhibit both early pro-inflammatory cytokines and key aspects of the type I IFN pathway. These findings suggest that budesonide and formoterol curtail excessive inflammation induced by rhinovirus infections in patients with asthma, but whether this inhibits viral clearance in vivo remains to be determined.",

To accurately screen drug formulations for chronic IBD, a relevant model that mimics the chronic condition in vitro is urgently needed. In an effort to reduce and potentially replace this scientifically and ethically questionable animal testing for IBD drugs, our laboratory has developed an in vitro model for the inflamed intestinal mucosa observed in chronic IBD, which allows high-throughput screening of anti-inflammatory drugs and their formulations. The in vitro model consists of intestinal epithelial cells, human blood-derived macrophages, and dendritic cells that are stimulated by the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 Beta. In this study, the model was utilized for evaluation of the efficacy and deposition of budesonide, an anti-inflammatory drug, in three different pharmaceutical formulations: (1) a free drug solution, (2) encapsulated into PLGA nanoparticles, and (3) encapsulated into liposomes. The in vitro model of the inflamed intestinal mucosa demonstrated its ability to differentiate therapeutic efficacy among the formulations while maintaining the convenience of conventional in vitro studies and adequately representing the complex pathophysiological changes observed in vivo.",

Primary cultured, purified, and identified the epithelial cells collected from nasal polyps. The proliferation of nasal polyp epithelial cells was examined by a cell counting kit, and expression of GR-alpha mRNA in nasal polyp epithelial cells was examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, after training nasal polyp epithelial cells in budesonide solution. The average survival rate of nasal polyp epithelial cells was the lowest in 1 x 10(-6) M budesonide solution (29.284 +/-0.311%), compared with other concentrations. Budesonide at 1 x 10(-8) M caused down-regulation of GR-alpha mRNA expression levels at 6 and 12 ours, compared with the 0-hour group (p < 0.001); compared with the 0-hour group, there were significantly lower expression levels of GR-alpha mRNA at both 24 and 48 hours (p < 0.001); Expression of GR-alpha mRNA at either 48 or 12 hours was not significantly different from that at 24 hours. Budesonide can significantly inhibit the proliferation of nasal polyp epithelial cells, down-regulate the expression of GR-alpha mRNA in nasal polyp epithelial cells with time dependence.",

Twenty-seven urine samples tested positive for glucocorticoids or beta-2-agonists and twenty samples coming from volunteers and clean athletes were analyzed with the two different mass spectrometry approaches using both positive and negative electrospray ionization modes. Urine is a highly complex matrix containing thousands of metabolites having different chemical properties and a high dynamic range. We used multivariate analysis techniques to unravel this huge data set. Thus, the several groups we created were studied by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square regression (PLS-DA and OPLS) in the search of discriminating m/z values. The selected variables were annotated and placed on pathway by using MassTRIX."

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Patch tests have indicated that budesonide can produce delayed allergic reactions, and atopic dermatitis. In cases of inhalational exposure, periorificial dermatitis has been reported. In cases of oral administration, Candida albicans esophagitis, dysphagia, elevated blood pressure, lower extremity edema, and weight gain have been reported, although some of these adverse events may have been the result of a drug interaction with voriconazole. Epidemiological studies have found an increased risk of pneumonia, cardiac dysrhythmias, cataracts, and fractures associated with inhaled budesonide use. Additional epidemiological studies have found that budesonide inhalation during pregnancy may be a risk factor for offspring endocrine and metabolic disturbances. Low birth weight has also been reported. In children taking budesonide for persistent asthma, slower linear growth, slow weight gain, and slow skeletal maturation have also been observed.  Localized Candidal infections of the nose and pharynx has been reported during intranasal budesonide therapy. Patients may be at an increased risk for certain infections, such as Varicella (chickenpox). In children and adolescents, administration of budesonide may cause growth suppression. It may also cause acute or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants of mothers receiving corticosteroid therapy during pregnancy. ANIMAL STUDIES: In carcinogenicity studies, hepatocellular tumors and gliomas have been observed in rats that received oral budesonide. In female rats that received budesonide subcutaneously, a decrease in prenatal viability and viability of pups during pregnancy and lactation was observed.  Pyloric hyalinization was detected in mice that received budesonide orally.",

We describe the occurrence of delirium with the combination of an inhaled glucocorticoid and bronchodilator. An elderly male described confusion and hallucinations within 1 week after initiation of budesonide/formoterol for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The combination inhaler was discontinued with resolution of symptoms. Several weeks later, the patient was hospitalized and restarted on the combination inhaler. The patient was alert and oriented on admission, however, confusion and hallucinations progressed throughout his hospital stay. The combination inhaler was discontinued and his confusion and hallucinations resolved by discharge. The temporal relationship of these events and a probable Naranjo association allows for reasonable assumption that the use of the budesonide/formoterol combination inhaler caused or contributed to the occurrences of delirium in this elderly patient. The onset of delirium was likely due to the systemic absorption of the glucocorticoid from lung deposition, complicated in an individual with several predisposing risk factors for delirium. Health care providers should be aware of this potential adverse drug reaction when prescribing inhaled medications to older patients at risk for delirium.",

A 71-year-old man was treated with inhaled budesonide for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and itraconazole for a pulmonary aspergillosis. The patient rapidly developed a typical Cushing syndrome complicated by bilateral avascular necrosis of the femoral heads. Serum 8:00 AM cortisol concentrations were suppressed at 0.76 and 0.83 ug/dL on two occasions. The patient died 4 days later of a massive myocardial infarction. The second case is a 46-year-old woman who was treated for several years with inhaled budesonide for asthma. She was put on ritonavir, a retroviral protease inhibitor, for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In the following months, she developed typical signs of Cushing syndrome. Her morning serum cortisol concentration was 1.92 ug/dL. A cosyntropin stimulation test showed values of serum cortisol of <1.10, 2.65, and 5.36 ug/dL at 0, 30, and 60 minutes, respectively, confirming an adrenal insufficiency. Because the patient was unable to stop budesonide, she was advised to reduce the frequency of its administration and eventually taper the dose until cessation. Clinicians should be aware of the potential occurrence of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome and secondary adrenal insufficiency due to the association of inhaled corticosteroids with itraconazole or ritonavir.",

Voriconazole, a second-generation triazole antifungal agent, is both a substrate and potent inhibitor of CYP isoenzymes, specifically CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4; thus, the potential for drug-drug interactions with voriconazole is high. To our knowledge, drug-drug interactions between voriconazole and corticosteroids have not been specifically reported in the literature. We describe a 48-year-old woman who was receiving oral budesonide 9 mg/day for the management of Crohn's disease and was diagnosed with fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans esophagitis; oral voriconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 3 weeks was prescribed for treatment. Because the patient experienced recurrent symptoms of dysphagia, a second 3-week course of voriconazole therapy was taken. Seven weeks after originally being prescribed voriconazole, she came to her primary care clinic with elevated blood pressure, lower extremity edema, and weight gain; she was prescribed a diuretic and evaluated for renal dysfunction. At a follow-up visit 6 weeks later with her specialty clinic, the patient's blood pressure was elevated, and her physical examination was notable for moon facies, posterior cervical fat pad prominence, and lower extremity pitting edema. Iatrogenic Cushing syndrome due to a drug-drug interaction between voriconazole and budesonide was suspected, and voriconazole was discontinued. Budesonide was continued as previously prescribed for her Crohn's disease. On reevaluation 2 months later, the patient's Cushingoid features had markedly regressed. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome due to a probable interaction between voriconazole and oral budesonide. In patients presenting with Cushingoid features who have received these drugs concomitantly, clinicians should consider the potential drug interaction between these agents, and the risks and benefits of continued therapy must be considered.",

To evaluate the outcome of a second patch test reading of TRUE Test allergens on D6/7 in relation to negative or doubtful reactions on D3/4. This was a retrospective investigation of patch test data from January 1992 to October 2011 from consecutive eczema patients tested with the TRUE Test panels.  In the period of nearly 20 years, a total of 9997 patients were tested. The total number of positive reactions to the 29 allergens was 6509; 4.4% were positive on D6/7 and negative on D3/4; and 9.1% were positive on D6/7 after a doubtful (+) reaction on D3/4. Neomycin was the most frequent allergen giving delayed positive reactions (57%), followed by budesonide (42%) and hydrocortisone-17-butyrate (31%). A total of 4.4% of positive TRUE Test reactions would be missed, and 9.1% might be missed, if only one reading was performed on D3/4. The results emphasize that many doubtful reactions at D3/4 may develop into positive reactions at a later reading. This may have important implications for evaluation of the clinical relevance of the test result.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of contact dermatitis in the population of patients with AD.  A total of 39 patients with clinical diagnosis of AD during remission were patch tested with 28 European Baseline Series allergens and 8 corticosteroids allergens in different concentrations and media.  Nineteen (48%) patients had an allergic reaction to at least 1 European Standard Series allergen, and 5 (12.8%) patients had an allergic reaction to at least 1 corticosteroid. The most common allergens giving positive results were nickel sulfate (28.2%), potassium dichromate (20.5%), cobalt chloride (12.8%), and phenylenediamine, budesonide, betamethasone, clobetasol, and dexamethasone (7.7% each).  This study shows that allergic contact hypersensitivity is common among patients with AD and affects up to 40% of cases.",

Patch tests with a series of 25 corticosteroids, some of them at different concentrations and in different vehicles, were positive to tixocortol pivalate, hydrocortisone, budesonide, prednisolone, hydrocortisone butyrate propionate, triamcinolone acetonide, and fluocinolone acetonide. For some of them, a 1% solution in ethanol gave a positive reaction when a 20% mixture in petrolatum did not. Like other authors, we suggest that some multiple positives may represent sensitization to several steroids independently, true cross-reactions, or both, and that ethanol is a better vehicle than petrolatum.",

A range of tissues was examined by light microscopy, accompanied by clinical pathology measurements to assess anticipated corticosteroid effects as a surrogate marker of systemic drug exposure. Microscopic changes seen in the stomach with each corticosteroid included pyloric hyalinization. This previously unreported finding was investigated using histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques and was found to consist of hyalinized collagen, in association with increased immunohistochemical signal for transglutaminase-2 and osteopontin. The significance of the osteopontin finding is unclear; however, the ability of transglutaminase-2 to facilitate the formation of degradation resistant protein bonds implies this protein may be involved in the pathogenesis of this change. Furthermore, published evidence that transglutaminase-2 may be induced by a corticosteroid agonist raises the possibility that pyloric stomach hyalinization may be a class effect of corticosteroids via the action of this enzyme.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.8X10-15 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates budesonide will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase budesonide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Budesonide contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, budesonide is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 120. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-13 atm-cu m/mole. Budesonide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water where not available. If released into water, budesonide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 60 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to budesonide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where budesonide is produced or used. The general public is not likely to be exposed to budesonide unless by direct medical treatment. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

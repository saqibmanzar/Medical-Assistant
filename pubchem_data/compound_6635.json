When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

If released to the atmosphere, chlorfenson will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere, based on a measured vapor pressure of 1.9X10-6 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase chlorfenson is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 2 to 3 days. Particulate-phase chlorfenson may be physically removed from the air by dry deposition. An estimated Koc of 17,000 suggests that chlorfenson will be immobile in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces should not be expected based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-7 atm cu m/mol, or from dry soil surfaces given the vapor pressure of chlorfenson. Chlorfenson is expected to adsorb to suspended matter in the water based on its Koc value. This compound should not volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF value of 930 suggests that chlorfenson will bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. The general population may be exposed to chlorfenson through the ingestion of contaminated foods.

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

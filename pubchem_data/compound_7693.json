When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Corrosives in contact with metals may evolve flammable hydrogen gas. Containers may explode when heated or if contaminated with water. (ERG, 2024)",

Occupational asthma was detected in workers exposed to isocyanates.  Isocyanates may cause dermatitis when contacting the skin and vapors are highly irritating to the mucous membranes of the eyes nose and throat. Exposure to isocyanates may produce gastrointestinal symptoms. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact.",

In all cases RAST and/or skin-test investigations revealed the presence of IgE antibodies reacting specifically with HSA conjugated with those isocyanates to which workers were exposed as well as with other isocyanates with which they had not been in contact. By the RAST inhibition technique, moderate to strong mutual cross-reactivities between all tested isocyanate-HSA conjugates--even between aromatic and aliphatic ones--could be demonstrated in tests with five sera. The magnitudes of cross-reactivities differed, however, from one patient to another. One serum contained IgE antibodies that were almost completely specific to TDI-HSA; with this serum only weak cross-reactivities with other isocyanate conjugates could be demonstrated. These results indicate the predominance of closely related antigenic determinants in HSA conjugated with different isocyanates. The common antibody-binding regions are obviously recognized to different extents by antibodies of clinically sensitized workers, indicating individual differences in specificities and avidities of antibody populations. Nearly complete lack of IgE binding of ovalbumin-bound TDI in RAST and RAST inhibition indicates carrier-specific antigenicity of isocyanate-protein conjugates. In addition, since unmodified HSA did not bind IgE, antigenic determinants of the conjugates studied should be predominantly formed by the isocyanate-protein bond regions and concurrently by neighboring amino acid residues of the HSA molecule. /Isocyanates/",

These compounds are potent pulmonary sensitizers which cause bronchospasm, even in patients without prior airway hyperreactivity. Diisocyanate compounds act either as inducers of nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity or as direct pharmacologic agonists. Isocyanates apparently have the potential to sensitize certain segments of the population. Elevated humoral antibodies (ie, specific IgE antibodies to the p-tolyl determinant but not the diisocyanate conjugate) were detected in sensitized workers, but cell-mediated immunity also may produce hypersensitivity reactions. In the absence of renewed exposure, radioallergosorbent titers may not distinguish sensitive from nonsensitized workers. At high doses, toluene diisocyanate may act directly on bronchial mucosa by interfering with cholinergic and adrenergic mechanisms. /Isocyanates/",

The compound is a photodecomposition product of the herbicide, monuron. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.194 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-chlorophenyl isocyanate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-chlorophenyl isocyanate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 days. 4-Chlorophenyl isocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to moist soil, 4-chlorophenyl isocyanate is not expected to leach or adsorb to solids nor volatilize due to its rapid degradation reaction with water. 4-Chlorophenyl isocyanate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, 4-chlorophenyl isocyanate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its rapid reaction with water. Volatilization from water surfaces and bioconcentration are not expected to be an important fate process based upon the rapid hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is an important environmental fate process since iocyanates hydrolyze readily in water to yield a carbamic acid. Occupational exposure to 4-chlorophenyl isocyanate may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-chlorophenyl isocyanate is produced or used.

Vapor-phase 4-chlorophenyl isocyanate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.5X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 4-Chlorophenyl isocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4), and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The toxicity of the PCNs to cows was found to increase with increasing degree of chlorination, the tetrachlorinated and lower chlorinated congeners having little or no effect."

Halowax 1031 is insoluble in water. There are 75 possible congeners of chlorinated naphthalenes. Commercial products are generally mixtures of several congeners and range from thin liquids to hard waxes to high melting point solids. The higher chlorinated naphthalene products have been used as impregnants for condensers and capacitors and dipping encapsulating cmpd in electronic and automotive applications and as temporary binders in the manufacture of ceramic components, in paper coating and in precision casting of alloys, in electroplating, stop-off cmpd, as additive in gear oils and cutting cmpd, in flame proofing and insulation of electrical cable and conductors and moisture proof sealants, as separators in batteries, in refractive index testing oils, masking cmpd in electroplating and in grinding wheel lubricants. HUMAN EXPOSURE: The major sources of release of chlorinated naphthalenes into the environment are likely from waste incineration and disposal of items containing chlorinated naphthalenes to landfill. In the past, chlorinated naphthalene concn of up to 14.5 mg/cu m have been measured in the workplace, while levels of 25-2900 ng/cu m have been recorded in out door air in vicinity of manufacturing sites. More recently, monitoring studies have revealed chlorinated naphthalene concn up to 150 pg/cu m at semirural sites and 1-40 pg/cu m at remote sites. Chlorinated naphthalenes can be absorbed via oral, inhalative and dermal routes, with absorption and distribution over the whole body after oral admin. Chlorinated naphthalenes, especially the dioxin like congeners, have been detected in adipose tissue, liver, blood and breast milk samples from the general population at concn in the ng/kg lipid range. Severe skin reactions (chloracne) and liver disease have been reported after occupational exposure to chlorinated naphthalenes. Chloracne was common among workers who handling chlorinated naphthalenes in the 1930's to 1940's. A cohort study on workers exposed to chlorinated naphthalenes at a cable manufacturing plant found an excess of deaths from cirrhosis of the liver. However, individuals with chloracne did not show a higher mortality due to liver cirrhosis compared with other workers. The mortality from all cancers was slightly but significantly elevated among all exposed men (standardized mortality ratio =1.18), but was not more elevated in the subcohort with chloracne. This subcohort showed statistically significant excess mortality from cancer of the esophagus and from benign and unspecified neoplasms. Symptoms described in workers exposed to chlorinated naphthalenes included irritation of the eyes, fatigue, headache, anemia, hematuria, impotency, anorexia, vomiting and severe abdominal pain. Halowaxes containing mono-, di-chloronaphthalenes did not induce chloracne to individuals after dermal application. ANIMAL STUDIES: Chlorinated naphthalenes can be absorbed via oral, inhalative and dermal routes, with absorption and distribution over the whole body after oral admin. The main target organs are the liver and fat tissue (besides the kidney and lung) showing a high retention, especially for the higher chlorinated congeners The amount of bioaccumulation observed incr with the degree of chlorination of the chlorinated naphthalenes. 1-Monochloronaphthalene demonstrated no mutagenicity in the Salmonella Ames test. Monitoring studies with seabird eggs have revealed a decr in chlorinated naphthalene levels between 1974 and 1987. Hydroxy metabolites have been identified mostly for the lower chlorinated naphthalenes (mono- to tetra-) in experimental animals. There are also preliminary indications for the occurrence of methylthio- or methyl sulfoxide chloronaphthalene metabolites in the feces of rats. Elimination of the parent compounds and/or metabolites occurs via feces and urine. Lower chlorinated naphthalenes are less toxic than the higher chlorinated naphthalenes. Long term and carcinogenicity studies with chlorinated naphthalenes have not been performed. Like related cmpd, chlorinated naphthalenes have been demonstrated to be inducers of the cytochrome p450 (CYP) dependent microsomal enzymes. Cattle developed severe systemic disease (bovine hyperkeratosis) during a 5 to 10 day oral exposure of pentachlorinated naphthalenes. Chlorinated naphthalenes were also found to change lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities in rats in a manner indicative of oxidative stress. At least some of the biological and toxic responses of chlorinated naphthalenes are believed to be mediated via the cytosolic Ah receptor, resembling those of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related cmpd. Short term exposure to higher chlorinated naphthalenes resulted in mortality, liver damage, degeneration of the kidneys etc in rats, rabbits and cattle. Inhalation of a penta/hexachloronaphthalene mixture for 143 days resulted in a slight to moderate histological liver damage in rats. All chlorinated naphthalenes tested cause skin irritations in laboratory animals. Chlorinated napthalenes appear to be of moderate to high acute toxicity to aquatic organisms. /Chlorinated naphthalenes, Halowaxes, Higher Chlorinated Naphthalenes/",

Commercial products are generally mixtures of several congeners and range from thin liquids to hard waxes to high melting point solids. Their main uses have been in cable insulation, wood preservation, engine oil additives, electroplating masking compounds, capacitors and refractive index testing oils and as a feedstock for dye production. HUMAN EXPOSURE: The major sources of release of chlorinated naphthalenes into the environment are likely from waste incineration and disposal of items containing chlorinated naphthalenes to landfill. In the past, chlorinated naphthalene concn of up to 14.5 mg/cu m have been measured in the workplace, while levels of 25-2900 ng/cu m have been recorded in out door air in vicinity of manufacturing sites. More recently, monitoring studies have revealed chlorinated naphthalene concn up to 150 pg/cu m at semirural sites and 1-40 pg/cu m at remote sites. A single study on chlorinated tap water revealed 0.44 ng monochloronaphthalene/l. Chlorinated naphthalenes can be absorbed via oral, inhalative and dermal routes, with absorption and distribution over the whole body after oral admin. Chlorinated naphthalenes, especially the dioxin-like congeners, have been detected in adipose tissue, liver, blood and breast milk samples from the general population at concn in the ng/kg lipid range. Severe skin reactions (chloracne) and liver disease have been reported after occupational exposure to chlorinated naphthalenes. Chloracne was common among workers who handling chlorinated naphthalenes in the 1930's to 1940's. A cohort study on workers exposed to chlorinated naphthalenes at a cable manufacturing plant found an excess of deaths from cirrhosis of the liver. However, individuals with chloracne did not show a higher mortality due to liver cirrhosis compared with other workers. The mortality from all cancers was slightly but significantly elevated among all exposed men (standardized mortality ratio =1.18), but was not more elevated in the subcohort with chloracne. This subcohort showed statistically significant excess mortality from cancer of the esophagus and from benign and unspecified neoplasms. Symptoms described in workers exposed to chlorinated naphthalenes included irritation of the eyes, fatigue, headache, anemia, hematuria, impotency, anorexia, vomiting and severe abdominal pain. ANIMAL STUDIES: Chlorinated naphthalenes have been shown to be highly bioaccumulative in fish, but less so in shrimp and algae. The amount of bioaccumulation observed incr with the degree of chlorination of the chlorinated naphthalenes. The most highly chlorinated naphthalenes do not appear to bioaccumulate. Monochloronaphthalenes appear to be readily degradable by soil and water microorganisms under aerobic conditions. Chlorinated naphthalene concn in fish range up to a maximum of around 300 ug/kg lipid weight. Monitoring studies with seabird eggs have revealed a decr in chlorinated naphthalene levels between 1974 and 1987. Hydroxy metabolites have been identified mostly for the lower chlorinated naphthalenes (mono- to tetra-) in experimental animals. There are also preliminary indications for the occurrence of methylthio- or methyl sulfoxide chloronaphthalene metabolites in the feces of rats. Elimination of the parent compounds and/or metabolites occurs via feces and urine. The higher chlorinated congeners appeared to be more toxic than the lower chlorinated ones. Long term and carcinogenicity studies with chlorinated naphthalenes have not been performed. 1-Monochloronaphthalene was not mutagenic in the Salmonella Ames test. Like related cmpd, chlorinated naphthalenes have been demonstrated to be inducers of the cytochrome p450 (CYP) dependent microsomal enzymes. Chlorinated naphthalenes were also found to change lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities in rats in a manner indicative of oxidative stress. At least some of the biological and toxic responses of chlorinated naphthalenes are believed to be mediated via the cytosolic Ah receptor, resembling those of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related cmpd. All chlorinated naphthalenes tested cause skin irritations in laboratory animals. Chlorinated napthalenes appear to be of moderate to high acute toxicity to aquatic organisms. /Chlorinated naphthalenes, Monochloronaphthalenes/",

Examine the blood smear for \"ghosts\" and Heinz bodies. If /hemolysis is/ present, monitor red blood cell count and hematocrit for anemia, urine for protein, and cells. Measure direct- and indirect-reacting bilirubin in the plasma. Monitor fluid balance and blood electrolytes. If possible, monitor urinary excretion of naphthol to assess severity of poisoning and clinical progress. If hemolysis is clinically significnt, administer intravenous fluids to accelerate urinary excretion of the naphthol metabolite and protect the kidney from products of hemolysis. Use Ringer's-lactate or sodium bicarbonate to keep urine pH above 7.5. Consider use of mannitol, or furosemide, to promote diuresis. If urine flow declines, intravenous infusions must be carefully monitored to avoid fluid overload. Institute hemodialysis. Consider charcoal hemoperfusion in tandem to extract naphthalene and end-products. If anemia is severe, blood transfusions may be needed. Hydrocortisone may be of some benefit if significant hemolysis is present. /Fumigant poisoning/",

Results obtained for the Halowaxes were compared with the effects of animal pretreatment with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene, phenobarbital plus 3-methylcholanthrene (coadministered) and Aroclor 1254, a commercial polychlorinated biphenyl. At the higher dose level (600 umol/kg) all Halowaxes enhanced microsomal benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase activity (2 to 15 fold) and the hepatic microsomal cytochrome p450 content (1.2 to 2.5 fold); dimethylaminoantipyrene N-demethylase activities were increased < 40% compared to noninduced animals. Based on the enzymic and spectral properties of the microsomal enzymes from the Halowax pretreated animals, Halowaxes 1000, 1001 and 1099 were phenobarbital type inducers an Halowaxes 1013, 1014 and 1051 were mixed type inducers similar to Aroclor 1254 or phenobarbital plus 3-methylcholanthrene (coadministered).",

Both the Halowax mixture and the hexachloronaphthalene preparation showed hyperkeratotic activity at the applied concentration of 30 mg/g acetone (corresponding to 23.7 mg/day per ear), but the mono- and dichloronaphthalenes did not at concentrations of up to 590 and 290 mg/g acetone, respectively. The monochloronaphthalene (at 90 mg/g acetone) and dichloronaphthalene (at 45 mg/g acetone) congeners produced only very slight erythema without follicular accentuation and, histologically, a minimal inflammation. At the higher concentrations (590 and 290 mg/g acetone, respectively), severe primary irritant dermatitis resulted within 24 hr following a single application; histologically, severe inflammation was seen without sebaceous gland decrease, lysis, and necrosis.",

Both the Halowax mixture and the hexachloronaphthalene preparation showed hyperkeratotic activity at the applied concentration of 30 mg/g acetone (corresponding to 23.7 mg/day per ear), but the mono- and dichloronaphthalenes did not at concentrations of up to 590 and 290 mg/g acetone, respectively. The monochloronaphthalene (at 90 mg/g acetone) and dichloronaphthalene (at 45 mg/g acetone) congeners produced only very slight erythema without follicular accentuation and, histologically, a minimal inflammation. At the higher concentrations (590 and 290 mg/g acetone, respectively), severe primary irritant dermatitis resulted within 24 hr following a single application; histologically, severe inflammation was seen without sebaceous gland decrease, lysis, and necrosis.",

The experimental birds were given directly into the gizzard the MCN at doses from 5 to 200 mg/kg bw for 2 weeks. The level of vitamin A was determined by the method of Carr-Price four times: before the experiment, after the application of the two last doses of the MCN and after 2 and 4 weeks after the application of the last dose of the preparate. It was found that the MCN applied in high doses (100-200 mg/kg bw/day) decreased significantly the level of vitamin A in blood and in the liver. The decrease of the vitamin A in blood persisted for longer time, and this level did not return to the initial value by end of the experiment."

Halowax 1031 contains 20 percent tetrachloronaphthalene, 50 percent pentachloronaphthalene, and 40 percent hexachloronaphthalene. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.4X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates Halowax 1031 will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase Halowax 1031 will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 25 hours. If released to soil, Halowax 1031 is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3900. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Halowax 1031 is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Monochloronaphthalenes appear to be readily degradeable by soil and water microorganisms under aerobic conditions. No information was found on the biodegradation of higher chlorinated congeners by microorganisms; however, the addition of chlorines to aromatic structures is known to decrease biodegradability. If released into water, Halowax 1031 is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.3 hours and 6 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 60 days when adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 280 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to Halowax 1031 may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where Halowax 1031 is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to Halowax 1031 via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and household cleaning products containing Halowax 1031.

If released  to air, a vapor pressure of 0.029 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-chloronaphthalene will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient  atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-chloronaphthalene will be degraded in the  atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the  half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 day. If released  to soil, 1-chloronaphthalene is expected to have slight mobility based upon  an estimated Koc of 3000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected  to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of  3.55X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate  volatilization. 1-Chloronaphthalene achieved 0% of its theoretical BOD in a screening test using sewage sludge; no biodegradation data were located for soil or water. If released into water, 1-chloronaphthalene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 6 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. BCF values in the range of 142-403 measured in fish, suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. 1-Chloronaphthalene underwent 26% photodegradation in 20 hours when an aqueous solution was irradiated with light greater than 290 nm. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process since halogenated aromatic compounds do not readily hydrolyze. Occupational exposure to 1-chloronaphthalene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-chloronaphthalene is  produced or used. A segment of the general population may be exposed to 1-chloronaphthalene via inhalation of ambient air in the vicinity of hazardous waste incinerators and publically owned waste treatment plants.

Halowax 1031 may volatilize from water surfaces(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.3 hours and 6 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 60 days when adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 280(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). Monochloronaphthalenes appear to be readily degradeable by soil and water microorganisms under aerobic conditions(8).

Vapor-phase 1-chloronaphthalene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 day(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.5X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Laboratory exposure of an aqueous solution of 1-chloronaphthalene to light > 290 nm resulted in a photodegradation rate of 26% after 20 hrs of exposure(4).",

Using a sewage sludge inoculum grown on naphthalene, it was shown that 1- and 2-chloronaphthalene were both degraded on incubation with the inoculum(1).  The metabolism of 1-chloronaphthalene by two species of naphthalene utilizing bacteria has been investigated(2). The bacteria were grown in mineral salts medium at pH 6.9, with 1-chloronaphthalene added as the sole source of carbon. Two metabolites were isolated 8-chloro-1,2-dihydro 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene and 3-chlorosalicylic acid. These metabolites demonstrated that the initial site of bacterial degradation is the ring which does not contain the chlorine constituent(2).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1 day at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Halogenated aromatics are generally resistant to aqueous environmental hydrolysis(2); therefore, 1-chloronaphthalene is not expected to hydrolyze in water(SRC). Hexane solutions of 1-chloronaphthalene absorb UV light above 290 nm(3) which suggests a potential for direct photolysis in sunlight(SRC). Laboratory exposure of an aqueous solution of 1-chloronaphthalene to light > 290 nm resulted in a photodegradation rate of 26% after 20 hrs of exposure(4); addition of inorganic salts to the solution decreased the photodegradation rate(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 6 days(SRC).  However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 36 days if adsorption is considered(3). 1-Chloronaphthalene's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur; however, adsorption may also attenuate this process(SRC). 1-Chloronaphthalene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.029 mm Hg(4).",

Results showed that Halowax 1031 was identified in the coal tar leachate at concns unknown(1). Chemical species were extracted from trichloroethylene (TCE) soot generated from the combustion of TCE and methane. Halowax 1031 was detected in a 15.6 percent TCE mole fraction methane mixture at a concn of 43 ug/g soot. Halowax 1031 was detected in a 52 percent TCE mole fraction in methane mixture at a concn of 80 ng/g fuel in gas phase(2). Chlorinated organic compounds were detected during the combustion of propane in the presence of hydrochloric acid. Two components in Halowax 1031, identification and concns unknown, were detected(3). Analysis of sample extracts from modified method 5 from four different incineration test sites was conducted. Halowax 1031 was present in the forms of 1-chloronaphthalene at a concn of 10 ug/ml and 2-chloronaphthalene at a concn of 12 ug/ml. Halowax 1031 as a mixture was detected but not quantified(4). The thermolysis of chlorinated organics at different temperatures was conducted at various temperatures. Combustion of Halowax 1031 at 600 \u00b0C and 800 \u00b0C generated 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic ester, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, pentachlorophenol, alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, and polychlorinated biphenyls(5). Total Halowax 1031 concn from the combustion of octachlorodibenzofuran in mineral oil was determined to be <5 ug(6).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Furthermore, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which uses both protein kinase C and protein-tyrosine kinase activities to induce c-fos promoter, may share a common pathway with MC downstream of Ras. The signal transduction pathway induced by MC to stimulate c-jun promoter involves Ras activation and the JNK group of MAP-kinases.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: The gene from the 3MC-transformed cells was identified as an activated form of the human cellular transforming H-ras oncogene. 3MC may also elicit estrogenic activity in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Analysis of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-bound genomic regions after 3MC treatment of human breast cancer cells identified 241 AHR-3MC-bound regions, and transcription factor-binding site analysis revealed a strong overrepresentation of the AHR-responsive element. ANIMAL STUDIES: When administered orally to hamsters, 3MC produced colon neoplasms. When 8.4 mg of 3MC was administered orally to mice during their last week of pregnancy, mice had a 3-fold increase in incidence of tumors. The most common type was lymphoma and lung tumor. 20 mg/kg of 3MC injected ip on days 11, 12, and 13 of the gravid rat produced no adverse effects in the fetuses. 3MC was assayed for mutagenicity using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the Ames test, and gave positive mutagenic response (doubling of the spontaneous reversion rate) with metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Pretreatment of alligators ip with 3MC resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in cytochrome P-450 content. 3MC treatment (from 20 to 200 uM) during 24 hr produced apoptosis in both lymphocytes and phagocytes in carp.",

The commercially-available human uroepithelial cell lines were either SV40-immortalized (HUC) or SV40-immortalized and then 3-MC-transformed (HUC-TC). To characterize the SV40 - 3MC interaction, we compared human gene expression in these cell lines using a human cancer array and confirmed selected changes by RT-PCR. Many viral Large T Antigen (Tag) expression-related changes occurred in HUC-TC, and it is concluded that SV40 and 3-MC may act synergistically to transform cells. Changes noted in IFP 9-27, 2'-5' OAS, IF 56, MxA and MxAB were typical of those that occur in response to viral exposure and are part of the innate immune response. Because interferon is crucial to innate immune host defenses and many gene changes were interferon-related, we explored cellular growth responses to exogenous IFN-gamma and found that treatment impeded growth in tumor, but not immortalized HUC on days 4 - 7. Cellular metabolism however, was inhibited in both cell types. We conclude that IFN-gamma metabolic responses were functional in both cell lines, but IFN-gamma anti-proliferative responses functioned only in tumor cells. ...",

The suppressive effects of brewed green tea and black tea on 3-methylcholanthrene (MC)-induced AhR activation and its downstream events were examined in the liver of rats. Ad-libitum drinking of green tea and black tea suppressed MC-induced AhR activation and elevation of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity in the liver, whereas the teas themselves did not induce them. Tea showed a suppressive fashion on the expression of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1). Tea suppressed the AhR activation induced by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) ex vivo. A part of catechins and theaflavins was present in plasma and liver as conjugated and intact forms. The results of this study suggested that active component(s) of tea are incorporated in the liver and suppress the activity of CYP1As through the AhR activation pathway.",

CAPE reduced the formation of the benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adduct. Moreover, CAPE inhibited 3-MC-induced CYP1A1 activity, mRNA expression, protein level, and promoter activity. CAPE treatment also decreased 3-MC-inducible xenobiotic-response element (XRE)-linked luciferase, aryl hydrocarbons receptor (AhR) transactivation and nuclear localization. CAPE induced hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein level and HIF-1alpha responsible element (HRE) transcriptional activity. CAPE-mediated HIF-1alpha reduced 3-MC-inducible CYP1A1 protein expression. Taken together, CAPE decreases 3-MC-mediated CYP1A1 expression, and this inhibitory response is associated with inhibition of AhR and HIF-1alpha induction.",

In this study, the mechanism of human metallothionein 2A (MT2A) gene transcription activation by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) was investigated. Cotreatment with 3-methylcholanthrene and dexamethasone, agonists of AHR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) respectively, synergistically increased MT2A mRNA levels in HepG2 cells. MT2A induction was suppressed by RNA interference against AHR or GR. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed a physical interaction between AHR and GR proteins. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that AHR was recruited to the glucocorticoid response element in the MT2A promoter. Thus, we provide a novel mechanism whereby AHR modulates expression of human MT2A via the glucocorticoid response element and protein-protein interactions with GR.",

Pretreatment of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) with p21 or p27 small interfering (si)RNA reduced 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC)-induced elimination of (3)H-thymidine incorporation, demonstrating their essential roles in the antiproliferation of HUVECs ... 3MC time- and concentration-dependently increased p21 and p27 levels, and decreased the protein level of CDK2 with no apparent alteration of p53 ... 3MC-mediated p21 and p27 inductions were eliminated by resveratrol, an AhR antagonist, suggesting their AhR dependency, further confirmed by AhR siRNA. Among the relevant pathways, p38MAPK activation sustained the levels of p21 and p27 induced by 3MC, which was eliminated by AhR antagonists and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant. 3MC concentration-dependently enhanced not only the consensus dioxin-responsive element (DRE)-driven luciferase activity, but also the binding activity of the AhR to the putative DRE derived from the p21 and p27 promoters. A deletion of the DRE (-285/-270) in p21 (-2,300/+8) only partially alleviated the 3MC-induced luciferase activity unless NAC was added, suggesting that there may be a DRE-independent mechanism associated with oxidative stress. However, a deletion of the DRE (-660/-645) in p27 (-1,358/-100) almost completely abrogated the activation. ...",

In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) elicits persistent induction of CYP1A1 expression in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and that this phenomenon is mediated by sustained transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 promoter. Treatment of HepG2 cells with MC resulted in marked induction (8-20-fold) of ethoxyresorufin O-de-ethylase activities, CYP1A1 apoprotein contents, and mRNA levels, which persisted for up to 96 hr. MC also caused sustained transcriptional activation of the human CYP1A1 promoter for up to 96 hr, as inferred from transient transfection experiments. Experiments with deletion constructs indicated that Ah response elements located at -886, -974, and -1047, but not -491, nucleotides from the start site, contributed to the sustained transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggested that prolonged CYP1A1 induction was mediated by Ah receptor (AHR)-independent mechanisms. Experiments with [(3)H]MC and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated rapid elimination of MC and its metabolites from the cells by 12 to 24 hr, suggesting that these compounds did not elicit sustained CYP1A1 induction via the classical AHR-mediated pathway. In conclusion, the results of this study support the hypothesis that MC causes persistent induction of CYP1A1 in human hepatoma cells by mechanisms entailing sustained transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 promoter via AHR-independent mechanisms. ...",

Previous reports have demonstrated that 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) is capable of altering the expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-regulated genes and antioxidant genes in liver ... . To investigate whether similar effects could occur in the extrahepatic tissues, adult male ICR mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg 3MC and then /were/ analyzed after 6 and 24 hr. We observed that the constitutive expression of AHR- and antioxidant-related genes was in a tissue-specific manner. Moreover, acute 3MC exposure significantly increased the mRNA levels of Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 in all the lung, kidney and heart. As to antioxidant genes, 3MC induced the transcription of glutathione reductase (Gr) in the lung and kidney at 24 hr and the transcription of glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) in the lung and kidney at 6 and 24 hr. Glutathione-S-transferase A1 (Gsta1) was significantly reduced in the kidney at 24 hr, while no effect was observed in the lung and heart. The mRNA levels of NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1) were induced by 3MC in all the lung, kidney and heart. Although the constitutive expression of catalase (Cat) is very low in the heart, the transcription of Cat was significantly induced both at 6 and 24 hr. No significant alteration in the transcription of glutathione synthetase (Gss), heme oxygenase 1 (Ho-1) and superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) was observed in all tissues. Taken together, our findings suggested the expression of AHR- and antioxidant-related genes in a tissue-specific manner with or without treatment of a PAH.",

The primary focus on the toxicity of PAHs is their ability to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated pathway and lead to carcinogenesis in different organisms. However, the influence of PAHs on the antioxidant system in mammalian systems has received only limited attention. In the present study, we observed that the intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) into mice significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and decreased glutathione (GSH) contents and the activity of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), indicating that serious oxidative stress had been induced in the liver of mice. Then, the oxidative stress signal activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) pathway by enhancing the mRNA levels of Nrf2, p38, and Erk2. Moreover, the mRNA levels of Nrf2/ARE target genes, including glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione synthetase (GS), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1), and Sod2, increased significantly after treatment with 3MC for 24 hours. The hepatic levels of NQO1 and the activities of GR and GS were also significantly enhanced at 24 hours after 3MC treatment. Because the expression of NQO1 is co-regulated by Nrf2/ARE and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/XRE in mammalian tissues, NQO1 may play an important role in protecting against the oxidative stress induced by 3MC. Taken together, our findings suggested that acute exposure to 3MC altered the cellular redox balance in hepatocytes to trigger Nrf2-regulated antioxidant responses, which may represent an adaptive cell defense mechanism against the oxidative stress induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",

All animal expt were done at 18 to 20 hr following the last injection. 3-Methylcholanthrene significantly increased the liver to body wt ratios (%) from 3.3 + or - 1 in the control to 4.0 + or - 0.2 in treated groups. In addition, arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase activities were greatly increased (from 62 to 827 pmol/mg/min; p < 0.05). Analyses of sucrose gradient profiles and equilibrium binding data of (3)H-dexamethasone bound to the cytosolic glucocorticoid revealed that admin of 3-methylcholanthrene to female Fischer F344 rats led to a significant 25% decr in the maximal binding capacity of the 5-7S cytosolic glucocorticoid (Bmax = 209 + or - 3 (SE) fmol/mg of protein compared to the vehicle treated controls (Bmax = 277 + or - 13 fmol/mg) but had no significant influence on the affinity of the cytosolic glucocorticoid (Kd = 0.9 + or - 0.1 nM). This response was not dependent upon the sex or rat strain (female F344 versus Sprague Dawley). 3-Methylcholanthrene treatment did not significantly alter the equilibrium parameters of (3)H-methyltrienolone bound to the hepatic androgen receptor indicating that the effect was specific to the hepatic cytosolic glucocorticoid.",

Livers from both control and treated rats were weighed and total cytochrome P450 levels were assayed. Microsomal protein was determined on solubilized microsome samples. Liver samples were studied for histopathology. The liver wt to body wt ratio was incr 165% over controls in rats receiving 3-methylcholanthrene. The hepatic lobules of treated livers were enlarged due to hypertrophy of hepatocytes particularly in centrilobular areas. The total hepatic cytochrome P-450 concn was higher in rats receiving 3-methylcholanthrene than in control rats (1.0 + or - 0.14 nM/mg protein). The cytochrome P450 inducibility in laboratory rats is approximately 50 to 100% of the control value.

In addition, we examined the expression of CYP1A, CYP1B1, and CYP1C1 by qPCR in liver, gill, and intestine of adult P. vivipara injected with 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) or held in clean water (control group) for 24 hr. All three tissues examined showed basal expression of the three CYP1 genes. CYP1A was most strongly expressed in the liver, while CYP1B1, and CYP1C1 were most strongly expressed in the gill and intestine respectively. 3-MC induced CYP1A, CYP1B1, and CYP1C1 significantly (20-120-fold) in the three organs, consistent with the regulation of CYP1A, CYP1B1 and CYP1C1 via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Validation of CYP1 gene biomarkers in fish collected from a contaminated urban mangrove environment was confirmed with significant induction of CYP1A and CYP1C1 in gills (10-15-fold) and CYP1B1 in liver (23-fold), relative to fish from a control site. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.3X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-methylcholanthrene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-methylcholanthrene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.9 hours. Particulate-phase 3-methylcholanthrene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 3-Methylcholanthrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-methylcholanthrene is expected to have no mobility based upon a measured Koc range of 364,000 to 6,390,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 3-Methylcholanthrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. PAHs with four or more rings, such as 3-methylcholanthrene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation. If released into water, 3-methylcholanthrene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. 3-Methylcholanthrene reached 2-7% of its theoretical degradation by conversion to CO2 in 8 weeks using three mixed inoculum obtained from freshwater and estuarine sediments. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 11.6 and 90 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 8,000 suggests that the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 3-methylcholanthrene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-methylcholanthrene is produced or used in biochemical research or where it is produced as a product of incomplete combustion of organic fuels. The general population may be exposed to 3-methylcholanthrene via inhalation of tobacco smoke. (SRC)",

Volatilization of 3-methylcholanthrene from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 4.3X10-8 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 0.0029 mg/L(5). However, volatilization from soil surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to soil(SRC). 3-Methylcholanthrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(SRC). 3-Methylcholanthrene, present at 500 ppb in water, reached 2-7% of its theoretical degradation by conversion to CO2 in 8 weeks, employing three mixed inoculum obtained from freshwater and estuarine sediments(6). PAHs with four or more rings, such as 3-methylcholanthrene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation(7). 3-Methylcholanthrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(8) and therefore is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure 4.3X10-8 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 0.0029 mg/L(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 11.6 and 90 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is >100 years if adsorption is considered(7). According to a classification scheme(8), an estimated BCF of 8,000(SRC), using a log Kow of 6.42(9) and a regression-derived equation(10) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, 3-methylcholanthrene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(11). 3-Methylcholanthrene, present at 500 ppb in water, reached 2-7% of its theoretical degradation by conversion to CO2 in 8 weeks, employing three mixed inoculum obtained from freshwater and estuarine sediments(12). PAHs with four or more rings, such as 3-methylcholanthrene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation(13). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4).",

Vapor-phase 3-methylcholanthrene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this  reaction in air is estimated to be about 1.9 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.0X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase 3-methylcholanthrene may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). 3-Methylcholanthrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

However, 3-methylcholanthrene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(4). Using a database of measured fish biotransformation half-lives of PAHs, a fish biotransformation half-life of 1.0-1.9 days has been estimated for 3-methylcholanthrene(2). A measured BCF of 13 was calculated for 3-methylcholanthrene using Daphnia magna which were exposed over a 30 hour period(4); the presence of dissolved humic material at 15 mg/L reduced the BCF to 2.3(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 3-methylcholanthrene is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 11.6 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 90 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is >100 years if adsorption is considered(4). 3-Methylcholanthrene's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). However, volatilization from soil surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to soil(SRC). 3-Methylcholanthrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Mice were pretreated as before and dosed at 3 to 5 times the LD50. Mean survival times were determined. Hepatic microsomes were obtained from mice pretreated with carbon tetrachloride or olive oil and incubated with malononitrile. The rate of release of free cyanide was investigated. The oral LD50 for animals pretreated with olive oil was 1.799 mmol/kg. The LD50 for the carbon tetrachloride treated mice was 1.626 mmol/kg. Brain cyanide concentrations in olive oil pretreated mice ranged from 0.35 to 0.74 ug/g. Carbon tetrachloride pretreatment lengthened survival and reduced brain cyanide concentrations.

The liver enzyme system was saturated at a concentration of 3.3 mM malononitrile and a pH optimum of 7.0. This enzyme system was inhibited by cysteine and glutathione and inactivated by boiling. ...

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Other symptoms include anxiety, confusion, tightness in the chest, and involuntary urination and defecation. Headache, vertigo (dizziness), agitation, and giddiness may be followed by combative behavior, convulsions, paralysis, protruding eyeballs, dilated and unreactive pupils, unconsciousness and coma. Tachypnea (rapid, shallow respirations) or hyperpnea (rapid, deep respirations) may be followed by respiratory depression or arrest. Lung hemorrhage and pulmonary edema may also occur. Malononitrile is irritating to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Lacrimation (tearing) and a burning sensation of the mouth and throat are common. Salivation, nausea, and vomiting may also occur.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

All the test nitriles liberated cyanide both in vivo and in vitro, with the exception of benzonitrile, although the extent of liberation and the effect of carbon tetrachloride pretreatment on the mortality of animals differed among nitriles. From these results, test compounds were tentatively divided into 3 groups. In group 1, acute toxicity was greatly reduced by carbon tetrachloride pretreatment, in group 2, toxicity was not significantly changed or was somewhat enhanced, and in group 3, benzonitrile only, toxicity was clearly enhanced. The amount of cyanide was higher at death in the brains of mice given group 1 compounds, the level being comparable to that found in mice killed by dosing with potassium cyanide. The relation between log (1/LD50) and log p for the compounds in group 1 fitted a parabolic plot, while that for compounds in group 2 was linear. For most nitriles, the in vitro metabolism was inhibited when the incubation mixture contained either SKF-525A, carbon monoxide, or microsomes from mice treated with carbon tetrachloride. When mice were dosed with ethyl alcohol, metabolic enhancement of nitriles was seen compared with the control. However, ethyl alcohol, when added to the incubation mixture, inhibited the in vitro metabolism of nitriles. /Nitriles/",

Massive cyanide overdoses have survived with only good supportive care. Immediate attention should be directed toward assisted ventilation, administration of 100% oxygen, insertion of intravenous lines, and institution of cardiac monitoring. Obtain an arterial blood gas immediately and correct any severe metabolic acidosis (pH below 7.15). Oxygen (100%) should be used routinely in moderate or severely symptomatic patients even in the presence of a normal pO2, since 100% O2 increases O2 delivery, may reactivate cyanide-inhibited mitochondrial enzymes, and potentiates the effect of thiosulfate. Avoid mouth to mouth resuscitation during CPR in order to prevent self poisoning. /Cyanides/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.20 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates malononitrile will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase malononitrile will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 476 days. The UV absorption spectra of malononitrile in aqueous solution shows that malononitrile does absorb UV light in the environmentally relevant spectra >290 nm; therefore, direct photolysis in the environment may be important. If released to soil, malononitrile is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 11. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.27X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, malononitrile is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Nitriles as a class are biodegraded by enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis. Thus malononitrile is expected to biodegrade in the environment. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The neutral hydrolysis rate constant for malononitrile in water at 25 \u00b0C was 0.00135/hr which corresponds to a half-life of about 20 days. Occupational exposure to malononitrile may occur by dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where malononitrile is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of malononitrile from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.27X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Malononitrile is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.20 mm Hg(5). Nitriles are biodegraded by enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis to ultimately form carboxylic acids and ammonia(6,7). Thus, malononitrile may biodegrade in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.27X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). The neutral and base hydrolysis rate constants for malononitrile in water at 25 \u00b0C were experimentally determined to be 0.00135/hr and 806/M-hr, respectively, which corresponds to a half-life of 20.2 days at a pH of 7(7); at pHs of 5, 6, 8 and 9, the hydrolysis half-lives would be 21.4, 21.3. 13.4 and 3.1 days, respectively(SRC). Nitriles are biodegraded by enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis to ultimately form carboxylic acids and ammonia(8,9). Thus, malononitrile may biodegrade in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Plasma profiles of these compounds were well explained by a 2-compartment model with a Michaelis-Menten type elimination process from a central compartment. ... Extents of brain uptake (brain-to-plasma partition coefficient, Kp value) of these drugs were det ermined at 3 different steady-state plasma concentrations (1-15 microM). The Kp value of each drug was similar under the three different steady-state plasma concentrations. The Kp value increased in the following order; procaine (1.1) less than PABA-Et (1.9) less than lidocaine (2.2) less than PABA-Pr (2.7) less than PABA-Bu (3.6). A linear relationship was observed between the Kp value and the logarithmic value of the partition coefficient obtained in n-heptane/water or n-octanol/water partition system.",

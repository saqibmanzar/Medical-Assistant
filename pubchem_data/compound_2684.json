When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Single oral doses across the clinical dose range are dose proportional.  Cevimeline has a volume of distribution of approximately 6L/kg and is <20% bound to human plasma proteins.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Cevimeline reduced the contractile force and  beating rate of isolated right guinea pig atrium at 1 x 10(-6) mol/L or higher and 3 x 10(-6) mol/L  or higher, respectively. Cevimeline reduced the contractile force of isolated left atrium induced by  electric stimulation at 1 x 10(-6) mol/L or higher. In anesthetized dogs, cevimeline caused a  transient decrease in blood pressure, tachycardia and an increase in femoral arterial blood flow at  0.01 mg/kg iv or higher. At 1 mg/kg it caused continuous bradycardia, a decrease in femoral arterial  blood flow and an increase in respiration rate in addition to the changes observed immediately after  injection. A transient negative T-wave was observed as the only change in the ECG immediately after  injection at 1 mg/kg. However, when cevimeline was injected intraduodenally, a decrease in femoral  arterial blood flow, bradycardia and a tendency to increase respiration rate were observed at doses  of 1 to 3 mg/kg. All these events in dogs were antagonized by atropine. These results suggest that  oral administration of cevimeline, can distinctly reduce  the muscarinic effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems compared to intravenous  administration. /Cevimeline Hydrochloride/",

General behavior: When cevimeline was administered orally to mice at 100 mg/kg, mydriasis, a decrease of spontaneous motor activity, tremor, convulsions, salivation, abnormal posture, abnormal gait, reduced grip strength and reduced response against external stimulating were observed, and 2 out of 6 animals died. At 10 mg/kg or lower, no particular sign was observed except mydriasis, which appeared to be caused via the peripheral muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Central nervous system: Cevimeline had no effect on the motor coordination in mice. Hypothermia was observed in rats and reduced spontaneous motor activity, analgesia and enhanced maximum electroshock-induced convulsions were observed in mice after oral administration of 30 mg/kg cevimeline. Slight increase in the rate of theta-wave band in the hippocampal EEG of rats and spinal multisynaptic reflexes in cats were observed after intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg cevimeline. At an oral dose of 10 mg/kg, prolongation of thiopental-induced sleeping time in mice was observed. The prolongation of sleeping time was inhibited by a peripheral muscarinic antagonist. These results suggest that cevimeline has muscarinic effects on general behavior and the central nervous system at the doses approximately 10-fold higher than the effective doses needed for saliva secretion. /Cevimeline Hydrochloride/",

Somatic nervous system: Cevimeline had no effect on the neuromuscular junction in rats and no muscle relaxant effect in mice. No surface anesthetic effect was observed in guinea pigs, but infiltration anesthetic effect was found after intracutaneous injection of solution (1% or higher). Autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle: Cevimeline tended to cause mydriasis at 3 mg/kg IV or higher in rabbits and dose-dependently caused mydriasis at 10 mg/kg po or higher in rats. Mydriasis in rats was also observed by ophthalmic instillation, caused via the peripheral muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Cevimeline elevated the base line tension of nictitating membrane in cats when it was injected intravenously at 3 mg/kg or higher. In the smooth muscle, cevimeline increased the spontaneous movement of isolated rabbit ileum (1 x 10(-6) mol/L or higher), contractions of isolated guinea pig ileum (1 x 10(-6) mol/L or higher) and isolated guinea pig trachea (3 x 10(-6) mol/L or higher). Cevimeline relaxed the histamine- and noradrenaline-induced contractions of isolated guinea pig aorta and augmented noradrenaline- and phenylephrine-induced contractions of isolated rat vas deferens. These effects were induced by relatively higher concentrations only i.e. 1 x 10(-5) mol/L or higher. From these results, cevimeline has muscarinic side effects on the somatic nervous system and on the autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle, however, in the case of oral administration, cevimeline caused no muscarinic side effect at the effective doses needed for saliva secretion. /Cevimeline Hydrochloride/",

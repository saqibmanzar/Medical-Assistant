If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

One rat was injected i.v. with 50 mg/kg of the test substance and killed 1 hour later. Radioactivity was greatest in the small intestine and kidneys, less in the liver and stomach, and least in the brain, heart, lungs, spleen, testes, muscle, skin, and bone. The greatest content of 35S, 0.66% of the total administered, was detected in the feces. The authors suggested that this observation may have been due to contamination of the feces with urine missed during the rinsing of urine residue from the cage after collection. The distribution of (35)S in whole blood was evaluated in 6 rats injected i.v. with 100 mg/kg of the test substance and bled during periods of up to 7 hours. Residual (35)S blood concentrations during 0.5 to 7 hours after injection did not exceed 5.3% in any of the 6 animals. The distribution of [(35)S]Thioglycolic Acid in the blood was further investigated in the New Zealand rabbit, with emphasis on binding to the following serum protein fractions: a1-, a2-, b-, and g-globulins and albumin. The test substance (70 mg/kg) was injected i.v. Most of the radioactivity was bound to albumin. The extent of this uptake amounted to 0.14% at 20 minutes after injection and had diminished to 0.016% at 3 hours. The small amount of radioactivity detected in albumin might have been due to isotopic exchange.",

The test substance (100 mg/kg) was administered to 12 rats via i.v. injection and to 10 rats via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Also, 2 rats were each given 75 mg/kg via i.p. injection. Animals injected i.v. (12 rats) comprised 1 group, and those injected i.p. (12 rats) comprised the other. Urine samples were collected 24 hours after injection, after which the administered (35)S was excreted, and excretion percentages were determined. The mean urine sulfate content for i.v. dosed rats was 82.3% + 1.6% and for i.p. dosed rats was 90.6% + 1.8%. Most of the radioactivity was excreted in the form of neutral sulfate. Two rabbits were injected i.p. with 100 mg/kg of the test substance, and 1 rabbit was injected i.p. with 200 mg/kg. Urine samples were collected 24 hours after injection. The mean urine sulfur content of the 3 rabbits was 88% of the administered dose. As was true for rats, most of the radioactivity was excreted in the form of neutral sulfate. Additionally, Thioglycolic Acid (100-150 mg/kg, no radioactivity) was administered to a group of 7 rabbits via i.p. injection. Significant concentrations of dithioglycolate (average concentration 28%) were detected in the urine at 24 hr after injection. Only negligible concentrations of Thioglycolate were detected.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, thioglycolates, permanent wave solutions, depilatories, and as a vinyl stabilizer. It is a sensitive reagent for iron, molybdenum, silver, tin. Mercaptoacetic acid is also used as a hair waving agent. In addition it is used in hydraulic fracturing mixtures to prevent precipitation of metal oxides (iron control). HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: An eczematous rash of the scalp, face & hands often results from contact with the thioglycolate of \"cold wave\" material used by hairdressers. This material has been reported to be absorbed in sufficient quantity to cause death. A lotion base containing 4.5% Thioglycolic Acid was applied to a 2 x  2-cm area of patients. Sites were rinsed 10 minutes later. None of the subjects had signs of inflammation. After a 12-hour interval, the lotion was applied to pubic, perineal, and scrotal regions, and sites were rinsed 10 minutes later. The lotion was not irritating to majority of the patients. Some patients complained of a hot sensation around the scrotum that lasted for only a few minutes. Thioglycolic acid (TGA) is the active ingredient of permanent-waving solution (PWS). The effect of TGA-containing PWS on the health of a human population was evaluated  in 3 substudies. Firstly, 57 female hairdressers exposed to TGA-containing PWS (cases) and 64 female schoolteachers (controls) were studied. Their menstruation state was evaluated with information obtained from interviews. The results revealed that the menoxenia rate in the cases was significantly higher than that in the controls. Secondly, 8 female hairdressers selected from those that participated in the above survey underwent a fluctuation test for the mutagenic activity of urine. Eight female medical students were chosen as controls. Difference in the mutagenic activity of urine on S. tiphymurium TA100 between the two groups was highly significant. Finally, a micronucleus assay was carried out on scalp hair follicle cells in healthy volunteers. Scalp hair with the follicle cell mass was sampled from 8 male and 8 female volunteers before permanent waving and at 24, 48 and 72 hr after waving. One thousand hair follicle cells were examined by light microscopy. The number of cells containing a micronucleus and the number of micronuclei in each cell was determined. The permillages of micronuclei in hair follicle cells before and after permanent waving were compared. Micronuclei presence reached its peak value 24 hr after permanent waving, which was significantly higher than that before waving. The rate decreased progressively after 24 hr. Thioglycolic acid was tested at concentrations of up to 300 ug/mL without metabolic activation and of up to 1000 ug/mL with metabolic activation in an in vitro chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes. Exposures were for 24 and 48 hours in absence of S9-mix and 2 hours in presence of S9-mix. Cytotoxicity was observed at a concentration of 300 ug/plate without S9-mix and at and above 1000 ug/mL with S9-mix. Thioglycolic acid did not induce a biological relevant increase in the number of cells with structural chromosome aberrations compared to the untreated controls in this test. Small quantities of Thioglycolic Acid, as cysteine-thioglycolic acid mixed disulfide, have been identified in human urine via high-voltage paper electrophoresis. ANIMAL STUDIES: Thioglycolic Acid (5%) caused death in a monkey at a dose of 300 mg/kg. Rats receiving the 660 mg/kg dose of TGA dermally died within 24 hours, whereas none of the animals in the 330 mg/kg dose group died. The following effects of TGA have been reported: potentiation of bradykinin-induced contractions of guinea pig gut and uterus; inactivation of hypocalcemic activity of the salivary gland hormone, b-parotin; stimulation of guinea pig skin histidase activity; inhibition of thyroid iodinating enzyme system (in calf thyroid) in the presence of a hydrogen peroxide-generating system; inhibition of uterine response to oxytocin in rats; diabetogenic effect in rats; reduction of rat hepatic succinoxidase activity; reduction of bovine antidiuretic factor activity; and inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. The effects of TGA on oocyte maturation and in vitro fertilization (IVF) in mice were studied by the method in vitro culture and IVF in mice oocyte. Results: The results showed that TGA could inhibit the germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) of mouse oocyte in vitro culture, but had no impact on GVBD in vivo. TGA could also inhibit the extruding of first polar baby and affect the quality and viability of mouse oocytes and reduce the fertilization rate of IVF and the oocytes number which were stimulated through superovulation. TGA might be hazardous to the meiotic maturation of mouse oocyte and might reduce the fertility of oocyte. That meant TGA had a reproductive toxicity to female mice to some extent. TGA was not mutagenic using S. typhimurium strains TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 with or without metabolic activation. A sex-linked recessive lethal mutation test was used in Drosophila melanogaster to evaluate the mutagenic potential of Thioglycolic Acid. The test solution was not mutagenic to any of the 309 X chromosomes tested. In vivo micronucleus testing of Thioglycolic Acid has been completed in the mouse, by oral and dermal routes of administration and no genotoxicity was found. Significant concentrations of dithioglycolate were detected in the urine of rats at 24 hr after injection. Only negligible concentrations of Thioglycolate were detected.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo genotoxicity in mice exposed to CdSe quantum dots of average size 5.0 +/- 0.2 nm and CdSe doped with 1% cobalt ions of similar size. The quantum dots are surface modified using mercaptoacetic acid (MAA) in order to be biocompatible and water-soluble. The MAA-QDs were given to the mice orally at doses of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg by weight of MAA-QDs. Bone marrow and liver samples were collected after two and seven days of treatment. The results indicated that after two days of treatment, the high dose of doped MAA-QDs was significantly able to induce DNA damage, formation of micronuclei (MNs), and generation of DNA adduct (8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, 8-OHdG). However, increasing DNA damage and the frequency of MNs formation as well as the generation of DNA adducts were observed with both the undoped MAA-QDs (2000 mg/kg) and doped MAA-QDs (1000 and 2000 mg/kg) after seven days of treatment. The results of /this/ study indicate that exposure to high doses of pure MAA-QDs or MAA-QDs doped with cobalt has the potential to cause indirect in vivo genetic damage, which may be attributed to free radical-induced oxidative stress in mice. /CdSe quantum dots surface modified with mercaptoacetic acid/",

The lab study was performed to determine the developmental and behavioral toxicities to zebrafish under continuous exposure to low concentrations of CdTe QDs (1-400 nM) coated with thioglycolic acid (TGA). The results show: (1) the 120 hr LC(50) of 185.9 nM, (2) the lower hatch rate and body length, more malformations, and less heart beat and swimming speed of the exposed zebrafish, (3) the brief burst and a higher basal swimming rate of the exposed zebrafish larvae during a rapid transition from light-to-dark, and (4) the vascular hyperplasia, vascular bifurcation, vascular crossing and turbulence of the exposed FLI-1 transgenic zebrafish larvae. /CdTe quantum dots coated with thioglycolic acid/",

Despite respective atmospheric deviations during 4-hour exposures of 21, 48, 53 and 22%, study authors reported an LC50 of 0.21 mg/l with a standard error of 0.040 mg/l. Mortality occurred in treatment groups administered exposures to 0.172 mg/l (2/5M, 2/5F), 0.338 mg/l (3/5M, 4/5F) and 0.582 mg/l (5/5M, 5/5F). Clinical signs of irritative respiratory toxicity during exposures included partial closure of eyes, wetness about eyes and mouth, abnormal respiration, restlessness, and hunched posture. Abnormal respiration, brown-stained snout and jaws, and sensitivity to touch persisted from 3-13 days of 14-day observation in a dose-related manner. Transient reduced food and water consumption was noted in both male and female rats of 0.172 and 0.338 mg/l exposures, and transient (up to 3 days) reduced bodyweight gains reflected effects of increasing exposure levels. Upon necropsy of study lethalities, lungs were found congested and of increased weight relative to controls. Terminal necropsy of all surviving rats at all exposure concentrations revealed no macroscopic treatment-related changes in the lungs. Detailed microscopic evaluation of decedent rats and rats surviving 2-week recovery disclosed no treatment-related changes other than confirmed lung congestion among study lethalities of 0.172, 0.338 and 0.582 mg/l exposures.",

Its use in hydraulic fracturing will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 8.68X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates mercaptoacetic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase mercaptoacetic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 hrs. Mercaptoacetic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, mercaptoacetic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.4. The pKa of mercaptoacetic acid is 3.55, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Mercaptoacetic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 100% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, mercaptoacetic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The pKa indicates mercaptoacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces and bioconcentration are not expected to be an important fate processes. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to mercaptoacetic acid may occur through inhalation of aerosols and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where mercaptoacetic acid is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to mercaptoacetic acid via inhalation of aerosols and dermal contact with consumer products containing mercaptoacetic acid. (SRC)",

Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Mercaptoacetic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 8.68X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

However, no report has been previously published on the indoor air concentrations of TGA in a beauty salon that contributes to assessment of exposure to TGA of hairdressers and their customers. This study aimed to demonstrate the present concentration levels of TGA in indoor air of a beauty salon where the PWS containing ammonium thioglycolate was actually used for perm treatments. A field measurement of TGA, dithiodiglycolic acid (DTDGA, a reaction product of TGA and cysteine residues of hair keratin) and ammonia was carried out in a beauty salon located at Tokyo, Japan, from June 30 to July 2. Both TGA and DTDGA were collected in water using an impinger and determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).The indoor air concentrations of TGA were below the limit of detection of 0.008 mg/cu m at every event and much lower than occupational safety guideline levels set by the NIOSH and ACGIH. Meanwhile, the concentrations of ammonia ranged from 0.15 to 0.87 mg/cu m, and relatively higher concentrations were found during perm events and in samples collected near stations used for perm treatments. Concentrations of DTDGA varied from <0.026 mg/cu m to 0.75 mg/cu m.There was a different emission process of TGA and ammonia from PWS, and airborne TGA is not important as a possible exposure route for hairdressers and customers in this beauty salon.",

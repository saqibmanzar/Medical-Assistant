First characterized in the early 1950s, galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid that was extracted from botanical sources, such as Galanthus nivalis. Galantamine was first studied in paralytic and neuropathic conditions, such as myopathies and postpolio paralytic conditions, and for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Following the discovery of its AChE-inhibiting properties, the cognitive effects of galantamine were studied in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and autism; however, re-development of the drug for Alzheimer\u2019s disease did not commence until the early 1990s due to difficulties in extraction and synthesis. Galantamine blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission. It also acts as an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic receptor, giving its dual mechanism of action clinical significance.  The drug was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, galantamine is not known to alter the course of the underlying dementing process. Galantamine works to block the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby enhancing cholinergic neuron function and signalling. Under this hypothesized mechanism of action, the therapeutic effects of galantamine may decrease as the disease progression advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. It is therefore not considered to be a disease-modifying drug. Galantamine is marketed under the brand name Razadyne, and is available as oral immediate- and extended-release tablets and solution.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This includes pKa (the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant) and pKb (the negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant).",

The deaths were due to various causes which could be expected in an elderly population; about half of the razadyne deaths appeared to result from various vascular causes (myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death). Although the difference in mortality between razadyne and placebo-treated groups in these two studies was significant, the results are highly discrepant with other studies of razadyne. Specifically, in these two MCI studies, the mortality rate in the placebo-treated subjects was markedly lower than the rate in placebo-treated patients in trials of razadyne in Alzheimer's disease or other dementias (0.7 per 1000 person years compared to 22-61 per 1000 person years, respectively). Although the mortality rate in the razadyne-treated MCI subjects was also lower than that observed in razadyne -treated patients in Alzheimer's disease and other dementia trials (10.2 per 1000 person years compared to 23-31 per 1000 person years, respectively), the relative difference was much less. When the Alzheimer's disease and other dementia studies were pooled (n=6000), the mortality rate in the placebo group numerically exceeded that in the razadyne group. Furthermore, in the MCI studies, no subjects in the placebo group died after 6 months, a highly unexpected finding in this population. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment demonstrate isolated memory impairment greater than expected for their age and education, but do not meet current diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease.",

As dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, galatamine has a negligible effect in altering the course of the underlying process of dementia and may exert its therapeutic effectiveness for a short period of time. However, galantamine promoted improvements in cognition, global function, activities of daily living, and behavioural symptoms in clinical studies of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  Galantamine exhibited therapeutic efficacy in studies of vascular dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease with cerebrovascular disease. In one study, galantamine reversed scopolamine-induced acute anticholinergic syndrome that was characterized by drowsiness, disorientation, and delirium.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

CYP2D6 promotes O-demethylation of the drug to form O-desmethyl-galantamine and the CYP3A4-mediated pathway forms the galantamine-N-oxide. Important metabolic pathways also include N-demethylation, epimerization, and sulfate conjugation. Other metabolites include norgalantamine, O-desmethyl-galantamine, O-desmethyl-norgalantamine, epigalantamine and galantaminone, which do not retain clinically significant pharmacology activities.   Galantamine can also undergo glucuronidation: in one oral radiolabeled drug study in poor and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers, about 14-24% of the total radioactivity was identified as galantamine glucuronide 8 hours post-dose. O-demethylation by CYP2D6 becomes prominent in patients with who are extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, but unchanged galatamine (39-77%) and its glucuronide metabolite (14-24%) predominated in the plasma of both poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 in a radiolabelled drug study. The total plasma clearance, or nonrenal clearnace, accounts for 20\u201325% of drug elimination.",

O-demethylation, mediated by CYP2D6 was greater in extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 than in poor metabolizers. In plasma from both poor and extensive metabolizers, however, unchanged galantamine and its glucuronide accounted for most of the sample radioactivity.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The cholinergic system plays a critical role in memory, alongside other important neural functions such as attention, learning, stress response, wakefulness and sleep, and sensory information. Studies show that acetylcholine (ACh) is involved in the modulation of acquisition, encoding, consolidation, reconsolidation, extinction, and retrieval of memory. The gradual loss of cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) may, therefore, contribute to the memory loss exhibited by AD patients.   Acetylcholinesterase is secreted by cholinergic neurons to rapidly hydrolyze ACh at the synaptic cleft to release acetate and choline. Choline is later recycled back into the presynaptic cholinergic neuron via reuptake by the high-affinity choline transporter. There is some evidence demonstrating the potential involvement of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the formation of amyloid fibrils. Galantamine competitively and reversibly inhibits the anticholinesterase enzyme in the CNS (namely in the frontal cortex and hippocampal regions) by binding to the choline-binding site and acyl-binding pocket of the enzyme active site. By blocking the breakdown of ACh, galantamine enhances ACh levels in the synaptic cleft.   Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in the CNS are mostly expressed at the presynaptic neuronal membrane to control the release of multiple neurotransmitters, such as ACh, glutamate, GABA, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine. Agonists of nAChRs improve performance in cognitive tasks, while antagonists of nAChR impair cognitive processes. Some studies show a decrease in the expression and activity of nAChRs in patients with AD, which may explain the reduction in central cholinergic neurotransmission in these patients. Galantamine binds to nAChRs at the allosteric site, leading to a conformational change of the receptor, increased ACh release, and increased activity of neighbouring glutaminergic and serotoninergic neurons. The modulation of nAChRs facilitates both excitatory and inhibitory cholinergic transmissions in brain tissues and increases receptor sensitivity. The modulated release of other neurotransmitters by galantamine may also contribute to the upregulation of nAChRs and amelioration of behavioural symptoms in AD.",

This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. If this mechanism is correct, galantamine's effect may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. There is no evidence that galantamine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

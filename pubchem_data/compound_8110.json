Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

                                            "String": "Benomyl (a non-thio fungicide) inhibits hepatic mitochondrial low-Km aldehyde dehydrogenase (mALDH or ALDH2) in ip-treated mice by 50% (IC50) at 7.0 mg/kg, which is surprisingly the same potency range as that for several dithiocarbamate fungicides (and the related alcohol abuse drug disulfiram) and thiocarbamate herbicides previously known for their alcohol-sensitizing action. The mechanism by which benomyl inhibits mALDH was therefore examined, first by comparing the metabolism of benomyl with the aforementioned mono- and dithiocarbamates and second by evaluating the inhibitory potency of the benomyl metabolites. Benomyl in ip-treated mice is converted, via butyl isocyanate, S-(N-butylcarbamoyl)glutathione, and S-(N-butylcarbamoyl)cysteine, to S-methyl N-butylthiocarbamate (MBT), identified as a transient metabolite in liver. MBT is >10-fold more potent than benomyl or butyl isocyanate as an in vivo mALDH inhibitor and is also more potent than the intermediary S-(N-butylcarbamoyl) conjugates. Benomyl and MBT inhibit mouse hepatic mALDH in vitro with IC50s of 0.77 and 8.7 uM, respectively. The potency of MBT is greatly enhanced by fortification of the mitochondria with NADPH alone or plus microsomes giving IC50s of 0.50 and 0.23 uM, respectively. This activation of MBT is almost completely blocked by the cytochrome P450 inhibitor N-benzylimidazole but not by several other cytochrome P450 inactivators. MBT (probably following bioactivation) inhibits mALDH in vivo with an IC50 of 0.3 mg/kg. Two candidate activation products were synthesized for potency determinations. N-Hydroxy MBT (prepared via the trimethylsilyl derivative) was not detected as an MBT metabolite; its low potency also rules against N-hydroxylation as the activation process. MBT sulfoxide, from oxidation of MBT with magnesium monoperoxyphthalate in water, is one of the most potent inhibitors known for mALDH and yeast ALDH in vitro (IC50 0.08-0.09 uM). These findings are consistent with a six-step bioactivation of benomyl, via the metabolites above and N-butylthiocarbamic acid, with MBT as the penultimate and MBT sulfoxide as the ultimate inhibitor of mALDH.",

Glucose- or ethanol-dependent yeast respiration was measured with an oxygen electrode, and manometric determination of carbon dioxide release was used to measure fermentation. Both respiration and fermentation were inhibited more by benomyl than by identical molar concentrations of its breakdown product, carbendazim. Butyl isocyanate, another benomyl breakdown product, inhibited respiration more but inhibited fermentation less than the parent compound. Of the isocyanates tested, hexyl isocyanate was the most inhibitory towards both activities. Captan was more active and iprodione less active than benomyl. Because benomyl rapidly broke down to carbendazim when it was prepared in 80% ethanol, only 59% of the dissolved benomyl was intact when it was added to yeast to determine its effect on respiration or fermentation.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The results show that n-butylisocyanate leads to a decrease in both ethoxyresorufin deethylase (P4501A1) (EROD) and ethoxycoumarin deethylase (P4502B) (ECOD), whereas MBC has no effect on EROD and increases ECOD. The decrease in ECOD and EROD activities after BIC treatment can be attributed to the detrimental action of this substance. The MBC-induced increase in ethoxycoumarin can be considered an enzyme-specific inductive phenomenon. This hypothesis was confirmed by Western immunoblot analysis and treatment with actinomycin D 8 x 10-4 uM: the first showed an increase in P4502B isoenzyme content and the second evidence of a partial block of the increase in ECOD activity induced by MBC. Given these results, MBC and BIC seem to be the metabolites responsible for the double opposite action of their parent compound benomyl. Data deriving from an equimolar mixture of the two metabolites suggest that benomyl activity on some cytochrome P450 isoenzymes is the result of a balance between the action of the single metabolites",

The formation of N, N'-dibutylurea (DBU), a phytotoxic degradation product of benomyl, in Benlate formulations was evaluated by analyzing Benlate samples maintained under simulated storage conditions and assessing the effects of temperature and humidity on sample moisture content, benomyl degradation, and the rate of DBU formation. Benomyl degraded during storage by the elimination of n-butylisocyanate (BIC) to form methyl 2-benzimidazole carbamate (MBC; carbendazim). Liberated BIC could then proceed to react with water to form DBU (first-order rate constant of 8.4 x 10(-)(4) s (-)(1)). The degradation of benomyl and subsequent formation of DBU were dependent on the temperature and highly dependent on the humidity of the storage environment. At the lower humidity storage conditions the rates of DBU formation were significantly higher in the dry flowable (DF) formulation than in the wettable powder (WP) formulation. The initial moisture content of Benlate DF samples was higher than those of Benlate WP samples, although the Benlate WP samples absorbed more moisture upon incubation. These results may yield insight on the appearance of high levels of DBU found in some boxes and bags of Benlate DF and Benlate WP formulations.",

This study assessed DBU formation upon (1). application of n-butyl-1-[(14)C]butylisocyanate (BIC), the immediate precursor to DBU formation, in four soils at two water potentials (0.03 and 0.1 MPa) and (2). application of benomyl butyl-1-(14)C-benomyl enriched Benlate DF and SP fungicides to two soils at various combinations of negative water potential (0.03 or 0.1 MPa) and temperature (23 or 33 degrees C). Parent compounds, metabolites, and (14)CO(2) were tracked using chromatographic analysis with radioassay and UV detection, liquid scintillation counting, and postextraction oxidation of the soil. At 0.03 MPa in all four BIC-treated soils, DBU formation was never detected. At 0.1 MPa, DBU was detected in two soils, but at concentrations <3.6 ug/kg (0.3 wt % of applied BIC). In both soils treated with benomyl formulations, DBU formation was observed with only Benlate 50 DF application at 0.03 MPa and 23 degrees C, which was followed by rapid dissipation of DBU. The maximum concentration observed was 0.41 ug/g (0.65 wt % of applied benomyl at 62.8 ug/g, which is well below levels currently reported to cause adverse effects to plants. Combined benomyl and carbendazim half-lives in soils across treatments were 2-3 months. This study demonstrated that further production and accumulation of DBU in soils after Benlate application or from residual benomyl remaining in the soil are highly unlikely and that persistence of any DBU in soils is likely to be short-lived.",

An excess of amine in a suitable solvent such as chlorobenzene is added to the sample and the resulting solution is allowed to react and the unreacted amine is back-titrated with dilute hydrochloric acid. For low NCO content levels, a colorimetric method is often used. The isocyanate-containing species is titrated with amine and the unreacted amine is determined using malachite green. /Isocyanate/",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

It is used as a reagent in organic synthesis; used as intermediates in production of carbamate, and urea insecticides, and fungicides. It is also used in the production of sulfonyl urea antidiabetic drugs. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: In female subjects exposed to N-butyl isocyanate there was an irritating effect to the mucous membranes and temporary lesions to the cardiac conduction system. Occupational exposure to N-butyl isocyanate may occur through inhalation, and dermal contact in the workplace where this chemical is used or manufactured. Butyl isocyanate is an irritant to the eyes of workers in an occupational setting. It is a strong irritant to to the skin. Individuals with a history of asthma, allergies or impaired lung function are at increased risk to the adverse effects of N-butyl isocyanate exposure. ANIMAL STUDIES: In a repeated exposure study, male rats were exposed by inhalation to N-Butyl isocyanate. No treatment related clinical signs were observed in the low dose groups. At the higher dose groups animals appeared unkempt, and exhibited labored breathing, reduced motility and an increased serous discharge from the nose. Substantial decrease in pulmonary function was noted in high dose treated animals. High dose animals exhibited widespread septal destruction, indicative of emphysema. In male rats, exposed to N-butyl isocyanate, neutrophils, LDH, and protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were elevated. Lung function parameters were decreased. This chemical was a sensitizer in guinea pigs exposed by inhalation. No irritation was observed in a rabbit ear exposed to a solution of N-butyl isocyanate. Butyl isocyanate was highly corrosive to rabbit eyes when instillation of test material to the conjunctival sac. Cats exposed to this chemical orally, had no related clinical effects in hematology or methemoglobin formation. Butyl isocyanate was negative in an Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535 and TA 1537 with and without metabolic activation.",

It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

In a repeated exposure study, 20 male Wistar-rats were exposed by inhalation to target concentrations of 1, 5, 15, and 25 mg/cu m n-butyl-isocyanate (BIC) for 5 consecutive days followed by a 5 week recovery period. Pulmonary function, blood gas, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) measurements were taken. No treatment related clinical signs were observed in rats of the 1 and 5 mg/cu m group. Rats exposed to 15 mg/cu m appeared unkempt and exhibited labored breathing, reduced motility, and increased serous discharge from the nose. Substantial decrement in pulmonary function was noted in animals exposed to 25 mg/cu m; decreases in pulmonary function were related to a stiffening of the distal airway parenchyma. Alterations suggested that the independent regions of the deep lung, including small airways, were sufficiently injured to impalr their ventilation. Histopathologic evaluation of the lavaged lungs in the 25 mg/cu m group revealed widespread septal destruction indicative of emphysema. The authors attributed delayed mortality to respiratory acidosis as a result of venous admixture and obstructive lung disease; BALF parameters were considered sensitive indicators of the condition of the lung.[Pauluhn J and Eben A; Archives of Toxicol 66 (2): 118-25 (1992)]",

No significant changes other than transient clinical signs were observed in the rats exposed to 7.6 mg/cu m air. Four weeks after exposure the animals of the 55.2 mg/cu m group showed significant effects: those were pronounced histopathological changes of airways and parenchyma, and elevated relative lung weight. The neutrophils, LDH, and protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were elevated. Quasi-static lung compliance, peak expiratory flow rate, mean mid expiratory flow rate were decreased whereas lung resistance, residual volume, and single breath CO-diffusing capacity were increased. Blood gas measurements revealed an elevation in hemoglobin, pH, arterio-alveolar oxygen difference, and venous admixture. Arterial pO2 and pC02 were decreased. In animals exposed to 23.5 mg/cu m only marginal effects were detectable.[Pauluhn J et al; Exp Pathol 40 (4): 197-202 (1990)]",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 17.6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-butyl isocyanate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-butyl isocyanate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 days. n-Butyl isocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Isocyanates undergo rapid hydrolysis under environmental conditions with half-lives of less than 10 minutes. Therefore, hydrolysis is expected to be the dominant fate process for n-butyl isocyanate in moist soil and water. If released to soil, adsorption, biodegradation, and volatilization from moist soil surfaces are not expected to compete with hydrolysis as important fate and transport processes; however, n-butyl isocyanate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released to water, adsorption to sediments, bioconcentration, biodegradation, and volatilization from water surfaces are not expected to compete with hydrolysis as important fate processes. Occupational exposure to n-butyl isocyanate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-butyl isocyanate is produced or used. (SRC)",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 4 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). n-Butyl isocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(2). The rate of hydrolysis for n-butyl isocyanate was not available; however, the measured rate constants for the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl isocyanate in aqueous solution at 15 and 25 \u00b0C are 5.9X10-4 sec-1 and 1.34X10-3 sec-1, respectively(3). These correspond to half-lives of 20 and 9 min, respectively(SRC). Therefore, hydrolysis is expected to be the dominant fate process for n-butyl isocyanate in moist soil and water(SRC). During a spill, the reaction of isocyanates with water would yield an unstable carbamate which undergoes decarboxylation to form carbon dioxide plus the corresponding amine(4). The amine would then react with isocyanate to form a symmetrically disubstituted urea(4).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

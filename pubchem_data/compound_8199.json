When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

No mutagenic activity occurred in either the absence or presence of metabolic activation with a Salmonella typhimurium reverse assay using strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538. In a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) forward gene mutation test (HGPRT locus) there was an increase in the mutation frequencies, which were relatively small compared with the solvent control values, somewhat inconsistent between duplicate cultures and occurred particularly in the presence of metabolic activation. Linear regression analysis indicated a marginally significant trend for dosage versus mutation frequency, suggesting that DEGHE was weakly positive in this test. A sister chromatid exchange test in CHO cells showed no significant dosage-related effects in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. A peripheral blood micronucleus test in mice by dosing with an ip injection of DEGHE did not show any potential for DEGHE to increase the incidence of micronucleated polychromatophilic erythrocytes. In a first femoral bone marrow chromosome aberration test in the rat by peroral dosing, DEGHE did not cause any increase in aberrations for 12-hr and 24-hr samples with males and females or with females at 48-hr sampling. However, with males at 48 hr the two lowest doses showed an increased number of aberrations, but not at the high doses. A repeat study in males with a larger number of doses and 24-h and 48-h samples did not replicate this finding. It is concluded that DEGHE may have limited weak mutagenic activity in vitro but is devoid of clastogenic potential.[Ballantyne B and Vergnes JS; J Appl Toxicol 21 (6): 449-60 (2001)]",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.18X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diethylene glycol hexyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diethylene glycol hexyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.5 hours. Alcohols and ethers do not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore diethylene glycol hexyl ether is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diethylene glycol hexyl ether is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Limited biodegradation studies indicate that diethylene glycol hexyl ether may degrade. If released into water, diethylene glycol hexyl ether is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to diethylene glycol hexyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diethylene glycol hexyl ether is produced or used.

Diethylene glycol hexyl ether is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

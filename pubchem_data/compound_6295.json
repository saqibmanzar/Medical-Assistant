If there are any indications of weakness, ataxia, or other neurologic impairment, clothing should be removed and a complete bath and shampoo given while the victim is recumbent, using copious amounts of soap and water. Attendants should wear rubber gloves. Surgical green soap is excellent for this purpose, but ordinary soap is about as good. The possibility of pesticide sequestered under fingernails or in skin folds should not be overlooked. Contaminated clothing should be promptly bagged and not returned until it has been thoroughly laundered. Contaminated leather shoes should be discarded. The possibility that pesticide has contaminated the inside surfaces of gloves, boots, and headgear should be considered. /Solid organochlorine insecticides/",

If the victim is convulsing, it is almost always necessary first to control seizures before attempting gastric intubation.

A nested case control study of pancreatic cancer among these chemical manufacturing workers to identify risk factors for this disease /was conducted/. Twenty-eight verified cases of pancreatic cancer and 112 matched controls were studied. Next of kin of each subject were interviewed to determine lifestyle factors, including tobacco, alcohol, and coffee consumption. Written work records and interviews were used to determine chemical exposures at the plant under study. DDT was associated with pancreatic cancer (risk ratio for ever exposed compared with never exposed = 4.8; with a 95% confidence interval = 1.3-17.6). Among subjects who had a mean exposure to DDT of 47 mo, the risk was 7.4 times that among subjects with no exposure. Two DDT derivatives, Ethylan and DDD were additionally associated with pancreatic cancer (risk ratio = 5.0 and 4.3, respectively); exposures to these two chemicals were correlated, and it was not possible to determine whether each acted independently of the other. Smoking was identified as an independent risk factor, but controlling for smoking (and other potential confounders) in the analyses did not appreciably alter the risks seen for DDT, DDD, or ethylan. Exposure to DDT was associated with pancreatic cancer. The association was not explained by lifestyle factors or other chemicals, and risk incr with both duration of exposure and latency since first exposure. These results may indicate that DDT can cause pancreatic cancer in humans under circumstances of heavy and prolonged exposure.",

Groups of 50 rats of each sex were admin p,p'-ethyl-DDD at one of two doses, either 3,500 or 7,000 ppm, for 105 wk. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated rats of each sex. All surviving rats were /sacrificed/ at the end of admin of the test chemical. Groups of 50 male mice were admin p,p'-ethyl-DDD at one of two doses, either 2,500 or 5,000 ppm, for 105 wk. Groups of 50 female mice were admin the test chemical at one of two doses, initially either 5,000 or 10,000 ppm. Because of excessive lowered body weights in the dosed groups of females, the doses for the females were reduced after 48 wk to 1,000 and 3,000 ppm, respectively, and admin at the lowered doses was continued for 57 wk. The time-weighted average doses for the female mice were 2,828 and 6,200 ppm. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving mice were /sacrificed/ at the end of admin of the test chemical. ... It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, p,p'-ethyl-DDD was not carcinogenic for male or female F344 rats or male B6C3Fl mice. However, the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in female mice was suggestive of a carcinogenic effect. ...

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.0X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates perthane will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase perthane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.1 days. Particulate-phase perthane will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, perthane is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.5X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Perthane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Although perthane is reported to be biodegradable, insufficient data are available to predict the relative importance or rate of biodegradation in soil or water. If released into water, perthane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.8 hours and 9.7 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 120 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 2,300 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Perthane is not expected to undergo rapid hydrolysis in the environment as the hydrolysis half-lives of analogous DDT is 12 years and 81 days at pH 3-5 and 9, respectively. Occupational exposure and general population exposure may be low or non-existent since perthane is no longer produced or used. In the past, perthane was applied directly to fruit as a spray and exposure to this compound was primarily by inhalation, ingestion of food, and dermal contact. (SRC)",

Volatilization of perthane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Perthane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 4.0X10-6 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). Although perthane is reported to be biodegradable(6), insufficient data are available to predict the relative importance or rate of biodegradation in soil(SRC).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.8 hours and 9.7 days, respectively(3). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 120 years if adsorption is considered(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 2,300(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Perthane is not expected to undergo rapid hydrolysis in the environment as the hydrolysis half-lives of analogous DDT is 12 years and 81 days at pH 3-5(7) and 9(8), respectively. Although perthane is reported to be biodegradable(9), insufficient data are available to predict the relative importance or rate of biodegradation in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

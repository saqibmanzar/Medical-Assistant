Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The toxic effects were estimated by monitoring alterations in activity of protein synthesizing system in liver tissue and by the analyses for the presence in blood serum of two tissue specific cytoplasmic enzymes of liver cells--urokaninase (EC 4.2.1.49) and histidase (EC 4.3.1.3). Single peroral administration of the substances at a dose equal to LD50 led to dissimilar alterations in synthesis of liver proteins: activation within 0.5-5 hours, distinct increases up to the maximal value within 60 hours, with a gradual decrease approaching the control values within 8 days. Urokaninase and histidase activities were found in blood serum within 8 hours after the intoxication, reaching the maximum within 15 hours and exhibited the constant level during 25 hours. Then the enzymatic activity was gradually decreased but it did not reach the control values within 70 hours. After daily peroral administration of these substances at the doses corresponding to 1/10 LD50 and 1/50 LD50, only the first dose inhibited the protein synthesis within 2 weeks. Within this period the enzymes studied were not found in blood serum. Distinct inhibition of the protein synthesis was observed within 4 weeks after administration of both these doses. In this case enzymatic activity was present in blood serum ... .  Within 2 months after administration of these preparations the alterations studied were the most distinct.",

Based on a 14 day range finding study, doses of 0.35, 0.75, and 1.5%, administered via feed, /estimated mg/kg doses were 230 and 1,000 mg/kg/ were selected for study. During cohabitation, both nitrobenzoic acids adversely affected litters/pair, live pups/litter, and pup weights (para-nitrobenzoic acid slightly more severe). meta-Nitrobenzoic acid treatment of 1.5% reduced postnatal survival. Crossover mating showed that the nitrobenzoic acids affected females but not males. F1 mice were fed nitrobenzoic acids at the parental dose levels from weaning onward and mated at sexual maturity. Both nitrobenzoic acid's decreased live pups/litter and pup weight for F1 pairs; para-nitrobenzoic acid effects were marginally more severe. Estrous cycle length increased in F0 females at 1.5% para-nitrobenzoic acid but not in the F1. Male reproductive organ/body weight ratios decreased in the para-nitrobenzoic acid F1 but not the F0. meta-Nitrobenzoic acid did not affect estrous cycles or reproductive organ weights. F0 and F1 epididymal sperm parameters were unaffected. It was concluded that nitrobenzoic acids are reproductive toxicants in Swiss mice, particularly in the females and at levels in the feed above 0.75%.",

Data from a 2 wk dose-range-finding study (Task 1) were used to set exposure concns for the Task 2 continuous cohabitation study at 0.35, 0.75, & 1.5% in feed. Based on mean feed consumption & body weight, the estimated daily dosages were nearly =0.5, 1.3, & 2.8 g/kg/day. During Task 2, 4, 3, 2, & 3 animals died from causes ranging from lymphoma to ruptures to partner-inflicted wounds to a variety of infections. There was no clear relationship to MNB exposure. During Task 2, postpartum dam weights in the middle & high dose groups were nearly =5-8% & nearly =12-14% lower than controls, respectively. Male body weights were reduced only at the high dose, by nearly =9%. Daily feed consumption was increased at the high dose, by nearly =10%. Reproductive performance was impaired during Task 2. Mice in the middle & high dose groups delivered nearly =10% & 27% fewer pups/litter, respectively. At the high dose, there were 14% fewer litters/pair, & a 14% reduction in adjusted pup weight. In addition, the high dose group took from 5-7 days longer to deliver the third, fourth & fifth litters, a significant incr. The last litter was reared by the dam until weaning. Pre-weaning pup mortality was increased at the high dose: ca. half the pups died before weaning, & the remaining pups weighed 30-40% less than their respective controls. The only effect at the middle dose was a 15% reduction in male pup weight at /postnatal day/ 21. After the last litter was reared, a crossover test (Task 3) was conducted with the control & high dose mice. There was a 33% reduction in the number of mated females who delivered a litter in the group containing treated females. Pup indices were reduced only in litters from treated females: they delivered 50% fewer pups/litter, & those pups weighed nearly =10% less than their controls. After the crossover pups were delivered & evaluated, the control & high dose F0 adults were killed & necropsied. Treated female body weight was reduced by 13%, & adjusted kidney weight was nearly =7% lower in the 1.5% MNB females than in their controls. While there was no change in estrous cycle parameters or length, there were more cystic ovaries in the treated group (3/11) than in the controls (1/22). Male body weight at the high dose was reduced by nearly equal to 10% & adjusted liver weight was increased by nearly equal to 6%. Sperm indices were unchanged. The F1 mice from all dose groups were reared on the same diet that was provided their parents, & cohabited within dose groups at nearly =/postnatal day/ 74. At the high dose, there was a nearly =20% reduction in live pup number, while adjusted pup weight was reduced in the middle & high dose groups by 13% & 21%, respectively. After the F2 litters were delivered & evaluated, the F1 adults were killed & necropsied. Female body weight was reduced in the middle & high dose groups by 5% & 23%, respectively. Adjusted liver weight was increased by nearly =12% at the high dose; estrous cycle parameters were unchanged across dose groups. Male body weight was reduced by 10% & 18% in the middle & high dose groups, respectively. Adjusted kidney weight was reduced by nearly equal to 10% at the high dose only. No significant treatment-related microscopic lesions were noted in the reproductive organs of these animals. Thus, meta-nitrobenzoic acid reduced weight gain in adults & caused significant reproductive toxicity in both generations. The second generation was not clearly more affected than the first. The female appeared more sensitive than the male, &, though body weight was reduced, non-reproductive toxicities (organ weight changes, microscopic lesions) were not marked.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.7X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-nitrobenzoic acid will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-nitrobenzoic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 26 days. Particulate-phase 3-nitrobenzoic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 3-Nitrobenzoic acid contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-nitrobenzoic acid is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 240. The pKa of 3-nitrobenzoic acid is 3.46, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.8X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation in soil is expected to be a slow environmental fate process. Decomposition of nitrobenzoic acid by soil microflora took greater than 64 days, and the compound did not degrade in soil after 25 days. If released into water, 3-nitrobenzoic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation of 3-nitrobenzoic acid is expected to occur in water based upon a 42.0% of theoretical BOD in river water after 5 days. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A pKa of 3.46 indicates 3-nitrobenzoic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 3-nitrobenzoic acid may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-nitrobenzoic acid is produced or used. (SRC)",

The pKa of 3-nitrobenzoic acid is 3.46(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization of 3-nitrobenzoic acid from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.8X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(6). 3-Nitrobenzoic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 3.7X10-5 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(7). Biodegradation of 3-nitrobenzoic acid by soil microflora inoculum took greater than 64 days(8), suggesting that biodegradation is a slow environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.8X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). A pKa of 3.46(5) indicates 3-nitrobenzoic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3.2(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A theoretical BOD of 42.0% in river water after 5 days(9), suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The river water samples contained about 8.0 mg/L dissolved oxygen, 800-3000/mL bacteria counts, exhibited a pH 6.8-7.0, and temperatures of 15-20 \u00b0C(1). Decomposition of nitrobenzoic acid by soil microflora inoculum took greater than 64 days(2). After 210 minutes, little oxygen consumption by phenol adapted biological cultures occurred with 3-nitrobenzoic acid(3). The amounts of oxygen consumed after the 210 minute test time are 83 ul (endogenous), 96 ul (cells plus 100 mg/L 3-nitrobenzoic acid), and 342 ul (cells plus phenol - after 90 minutes) which results in a ratio of only 1.2 endogenous to 3-nitrobenzoic acid oxygen consumption(3). 3-Nitrobenzoic acid, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0-12% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Methyl decanoate also occurs naturally as a component of some foods. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.037 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl decanoate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl decanoate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 37 hours. If released to soil, methyl decanoate is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 470. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.0017 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl decanoate is expected to rapidly biodegrade in aerobic soils as suggested by the rapid biodegradation of structurally similar long-chain fatty acid esters. If released into water, methyl decanoate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Methyl decanoate is expected to rapidly biodegrade in aerobic waters as suggested by the rapid biodegradation of structurally similar long-chain fatty acid esters. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 50 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. An estimated base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 0.03 L/mole-sec corresponds to half-lives of 7 years and 270 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to methyl decanoate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl decanoate is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to methyl decanoate due to its use in a number of commercial products. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

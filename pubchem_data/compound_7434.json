PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Groups of 2 male and 2 female rats were used in experiments to determine (14)C-TNB elimination through expired CO2. (14)C-TNB levels in urine and feces were measured at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after dosing. Approximately 10% of the dose was eliminated in the urine of male and female rats in the first 24 hours. Approximately 21% and 36% of the dose appeared in the urine in 4 days in male and female rats, respectively. Excretion via feces was approximately 4% in the same period in both sexes. The expired (14)C-CO2 was about 3% and 5% of the dose in 2 days in male and female rats, respectively. At 4 days after treatment, the radioactive residues were about 0.02-0.03%/g of tissue in the liver, kidney, skin and lungs, whereas other tissues showed lower levels of residues (about 0.001%/g or less). The results showed that a single dose of TNB in the rat was absorbed in the gut (administered in DMSO) and was eliminated mainly in the urine, with low levels in feces in 4 days. The results from this study did not show bioaccumulation of TNB in rats.",

Skin was dermatomed and assembled in flow-through diffusion cells followed by TNB application in either an acetone or a water vehicle. Skin absorption was expressed as the percentage of applied dose absorbed into skin and receptor fluid within 24 hr. Rapid absorption of TNB by rodent skin was obtained with both vehicles. For HGP skin, TNB absorption was 72.7+/-5.5% in the acetone vehicle and 82.3+/-4.5% in the water vehicle. For rat skin, TNB absorption was 61.0+/-4.1% (acetone) and 66.5+/-4.1% (water). Absorption of TNB from acetone was significantly reduced (38.0+/-11.0%, P = 0.0118) in human skin, but absorption from water remained high (75.5+/-10.8%). Little TNB remained in skin when a thin (200 um) dermatome section was used (HGP and human skin). A thicker dermatome section was required (350 um) with haired rat skin, and 13-21% of the absorbed radioactivity remained in the skin at 24 hr. Rodent skin did not simulate satisfactorily the barrier properties of human skin when TNB absorption was reduced by application in a volatile solvent.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as an explosive, as a vulcanizing agent for natural rubber, and as an indicator for pH 12.0-14.0. HUMAN STUDIES: TNB is alleged to have caused optic neuritis and amblyopia. Chronic intoxication also is said to have caused yellowing of the conjunctiva or sclera. These reports of intoxication and ocular disturbances have come from the munitions industry where commonly there is exposure to a variety of substances, and it is difficult to be sure of the individual substance responsible. TNB was found toxic in TK6 human lymphoblastic cells. ANIMAL STUDIES: Male rats were gavaged with TNB at 35.5 and 71 mg/kg in corn oil. Blood was collected 5 hr and 24 hr after a single oral dose or 24 hr after daily oral doses for 4 or 10 d in four different sets of experiments. A dose-dependent methemoglobinemia was present only in blood collected 5 hr after a single dose. A highly significant dose-dependent anemia with reduced red cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit was present in rats receiving TNB for 4 or 10 d. In a 90-day oral toxicity study of TNB, kidneys in male rats receiving TNB at dose levels of 67, 400 and 800 ppm TNB had an increased incidence of cytoplasmic hyaline droplets in proximal cortical tubular epithelial cells at all treatment levels. However, a diagnosis of alpha-2-u-globulin nephropathy was not deemed appropriate since there was no significant increase in single cell necrosis, no presence of granular casts or linear papillary mineralization or increased tubular hyperplasia. A 90-day toxicity test of TNB in mice revealed treatment-related changes in spleen (erythroid cell hyperplasia) and in testis (seminiferous tubule degeneration) in the 750 ppm TNB group. The carcinogenic activity of TNB was studied in mouse skin and lung tumor assays. A single application of 10 or 50 mg of TNB to the skin of mice increased the incidence of inflammation, epidermal hyperplasia and dark cells. TNB was found negative in assay for initiation-promotion of skin carcinogenicity. In rats, TNB-mediated tissue damage is accompanied by breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. The presence of vacuolation and associated extravasated serum proteins in TNB-treated rats is an indication of vasogenic brain edema, which appears to be a critical event in TNB toxicity. Sperm depletion and degeneration of the seminiferous tubules were noted in a reproduction study in rats. Mutagenicity was evaluated with the Salmonella fluctuation test (FT) and the V79 Chinese hamster lung cell mutagenicity assay. The fluctuation test results indicated that TNB was mutagenic. However, TNB was not mutagenic for the V79 mammalian cells with or without metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Slight irritant effects suggesting respiratory distress upon short term exposure to marine fish Kuhlia sandvicensis were observed at exposure levels of 100 ug/L, while moderate and violent reactions to the chemical were produced at exposures of 1,000 and 10,000 ug/L. Results from the hydra assay of TNB indicated the minimal affective concentrations required to elicit a toxic response in the adult hydra and in the regenerating hydra were 3.8 ug/mL and 1.8 ug/mL, respectively.",

Blood was collected 5 hr and 24 hr after a single oral dose or 24 hr after daily oral doses for 4 or 10 d in four different set of experiments. A dose-dependent methemoglobinemia was present only in blood collected 5 hr after a single dose. A highly significant dose-dependent anemia with reduced red cells, hemoglobin, and hemotocrit was present in rats receiving TNB for 4 or 10 d. A dose-dependent decrease in serum triglycerides was present in rats receiving TNB for 10 d. There was no hemolysis when rat erythrocytes were incubated with TNB (in vitro) for 9 hr. Spectral changes of hemoglobin recorded during the incubation with TNB confirm methemoglobin formation and progressive denaturation of hemoglobin-forming hemichromes.",

Male F-344 rats were dosed with TNB (0 and 35.5 mg/kg) for 20 and 30 days. Hematoxylin and eosin and Mallory-Heidenhain stains and alpha-2u-globulin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemical stains were performed on kidney sections. All treated male F-344 rats exhibited dose-related accumulation of hyaline droplets containing alpha-2u-globulin in proximal tubules. The kidney weights were significantly increased in male and female rats treated with TNB. Significant increases in cell proliferation in proximal tubules were observed in male F-344 rats. Renal changes observed in TNB-treated rats appeared identical to those from other chemicals that induce alpha-2u-globulin nephropathy in male rats. No hyaline droplet accumulation was found in female F-344 and male NBR rats at any doses.

Food intake by female rats in 400, 800 and 1200 mg TNB diet groups was reduced and resulted in a significant decrease in absolute body weights (BW). Food and water consumption by male rats in high-dose groups (800 and 1200 mg TNB/kg diet) was also reduced and resulted in a significant decrease in body weight. The calculated average TNB intake (from 1200 mg TNB/kg diet) was 92 mg/kg BW/day for male rats and 80 mg/kg BW/day for females. A decrease in testicular weight in males and an increase in spleen weight of both sexes in high-dose groups was noted. Histopathological examinations revealed that the susceptible organs for TNB toxicity were kidney (hyaline droplets), spleen (extramedullary hematopoiesis), brain (hemorrhage, malacia and gliosis) and testes (seminiferous tubular degeneration). Hematology and clinical chemistry studies indicated a decrease in red blood cell count and hematocrit, a decrease in alkaline phosphatase, an increase in Heinz bodies and increased methemoglobin concentration as compared to controls in both sexes.

The midge Chironomus tentans and the amphipod Hyalella azteca demonstrated significant toxic effects after exposure to TNT and its degradation products, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB) and 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (2,4-DANT). Significant reductions in survival of C. tentans exposed to TNT, TNB, and 2,4-DANT were observed at nominal sediment concentrations as low as 200 mg/kg. Hyalella azteca was more sensitive to TNT, TNB, and 2,4-DANT than the midge, where significant reductions in survival were observed at nominal concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Survival of the midge and the amphipod was unaffected after exposure to RDX or HMX at the highest concentrations of 1,000 and 400 mg/kg, respectively. Growth of the midge, measured as total weight, was significantly reduced by 2,4-DANT. However, significantly increased growth was observed after exposure to sublethal concentrations of RDX and HMX. Although significant reductions in amphipod survival were observed at high concentrations of TNB, growth was significantly increased at sublethal concentrations. The results of the current investigation suggest that organisms exposed to explosives at contaminated sites may be affected at concentrations less than 25 mg/kg through hormetic growth enhancement and at higher concentrations through increased mortality.",

Its use in explosive compositions will result in its direct release to the environmen. It is a by-product of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) production as well as a photodegradation product of TNT. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.44X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 34 years. Particulate-phase 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1680. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene contaminated soils showed 93-99.2% reduction after 238 days with controlled flooding, tilling and addition of grass clippings. 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene was degraded an average of 93.5% in 3 days at room temperature in three soils. If released into water, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene degraded (up to 100% in 85 days) aerobically in five river waters, faster degradation was noted in water with higher dissolved organic carbon content. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene in areas where spent TNT contamination has occurred. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 6.44X10-6 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 492 mg/L(5). 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.18(7) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene degraded (up to 100% in 85 days) aerobically in five river waters, faster degradation was noted in water with higher dissolved organic carbon content(8), suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 34 years(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.3X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

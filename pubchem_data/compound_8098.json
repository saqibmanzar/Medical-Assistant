ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Triethylene glycol (TEG: 0, 0.3, 1.5, and 3%), triethylene glycol diacetate (TGD: 0, 0.75, 1.5, and 3%), and triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (triethylene glycol dimethyl ether: 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1%) were administered in drinking water to breeding pairs (20 pairs per treatment groups, 40 control pairs) during a 98-day cohabitation period. Reproductive function was assessed by the number of litters per pair, live pups per litter, proportion of pups born alive, and pup weight. There were no apparent effects on reproductive function in the animals receiving triethylene glycol or triethylene glycol diacetate at doses up to 3% in the drinking water (representing 6.78 or 5.45 g/kg, respectively). However, some developmental toxicity was demonstrated for both triethylene glycol and triethylene glycol diacetate. Continuous exposure of dams to 1.5 or 3% triethylene glycol significantly reduced live pup weight at birth compared to control and 0.3% triethylene glycol significantly reduced live pup weight at birth compared to control and 0.3% triethylene glycol. while exposure to 3% triethylene glycol diacetate during lactation significantly (but reversibly) reduced pup body weights on Postnatal Days 14 and 21. In contrast, triethylene glycol dimethyl ether was toxic to the reproductive system as evidenced by decreases at the highest does (1% triethylene glycol dimethyl ether; 1.47 g/kg) in the proportion of pairs that produced at least one litter, live pups per litter, and proportion of pups born alive, with dose-related trends seen in the latter two parameters. A crossover mating trial showed that triethylene glycol dimethyl ether was more toxic to the female than the male reproductive system. These data indicate that triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (1.47 g/kg) is a reproductive toxicant in Swiss mice while reproductive toxicity was not demonstrated in mice receiving triethylene glycol or triethylene glycol diacetate (at doses up to 6.78 or 5.45 g/kg, respectively).",

Data gathered on body weights, clinical signs, & food & water consumption during the Task 1 dose-range-finding study were used to select concns for the continuous breeding phase (Task 2) of 0.0, 0.75%, 1.5%, & 3% /weight/volume/ in drinking water. These concns produced calculated consumption estimates of nearly equal to 1.31, 2.62, & 5.25 g/kg/day. Continuous exposure of adult F0 mice to these concns of TGD had no effect on the number of litters/pair, or the number or weight of live pups/litter. The proportion of pups born alive was not affected by these concns of TGDA. Since no effects were observed in Task 2, Task 3, which determines the effected sex, was not conducted. The last litter from Task 2 was nursed until weaning, & then given water containing TGDA at the same concn as their parents. Only the control & 3% TGDA groups were assessed in a second generation. Although viability was not adversely affected, pups nursed by dams receiving 3% TGDA weighed between 15 & 25% less than their controls at /postnatal day/ 14 & 21. These differences in body weight had disappeared by the time of Task 4 mating at nearly equal to /postnatal day/ 74. In the second generation mating trial, there were no treatment-related effects on mating or fertility indices, or on the number of F2 pups, their viability, or weight adjusted for litter size. After the F2 litters were delivered & evaluated, the F1 adults were killed & necropsied. There were no TGDA-related differences in body weight for either sex. In males & females, relative kidney weight was increased by nearly equal to 6-8%. No other treatment-related effects were found. Epididymal sperm concn, motility, & morphology were unaffected by 3% TGDA consumption. These data show that triethylene glycol diacetate had no detectable reproductive toxicity in Swiss mice at exposure levels that altered kidney weights & neonatal development.",

If released to air, triethylene glycol, diacetate is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 4.1X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase triethylene glycol, diacetate will be readily degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of 12 hours. If released to soil, an estimated Koc of 20 suggests that triethylene glycol, diacetate is expected to have very high mobility. Volatilization from wet and dry soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-13 atm-cu m/mol and this compound's estimated vapor pressure, respectively. If released into water, this compound is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon its estimated Koc. Triethylene glycol, diacetate is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces based on the estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 0.46 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 150 and 15 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively, indicate that hydrolysis is expected to be a slow process. Biodegradation of triethylene glycol, diacetate may be important, based upon 100% biodegradation of 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl acetate, a structurally similar compound. Occupational exposure to triethylene glycol, diacetate may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where triethylene glycol, diacetate is produced or used. (SRC)",

Triethylene glycol, diacetate is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-13 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 0.46(3,SRC), from an estimated log Kow(2,SRC), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 150 and 15 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively(6), suggest that hydrolysis is expected to be a slow process(SRC). Biodegradation of triethylene glycol, diacetate may be important(SRC), based upon 100% biodegradation of 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl acetate(7), a structurally similar compound.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Springer Nature aims to provide only highly qualitative and relevant content but references of lower relevance aren't withheld as they might contain also very useful information.",

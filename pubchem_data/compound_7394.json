They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Other male F344 rats were administered CTFT intravenously in a 10% Tween 80 aqueous solution. Serial blood samples were taken from a cannulated jugular vein for up to 52 hr after dosing and the CTFT concentrations in whole blood were determined by gas chromatography. The biological elimination half-life of CTFT from the center compartment was not affected by the vehicle used; however, absorption of CTFT from the alpha-CD vehicle was much faster than from the corn oil vehicle. The average absorption half-lives from the alpha-CD vehicle and corn oil vehicle were 17 and 98 min, respectively. Despite the differences in absorption, no statistical difference was observed in the calculated areas under the blood concentration versus time curves (AUC) obtained from rats dosed with either vehicle. Dose proportionality for CTFT was established up to 400 mg/kg and bioavailability was shown to be complete for both vehicles.",

This reaction can be carried out as a batch process in autoclaves or continuously in a series of autoclaves or tubular reactors. Typical conditions for the production of benzotrifluoride are a temperature of 80 - 110 \u00b0C, pressure of 1.2 - 1.4MPa, and a molar ratio of HF: benzotrichloride of 4:1. A yield of 70% is obtained within 3 - 4 hr. In continuous processing, a yield of over 90%is obtained in a nickel flow tube with a residence time of 1 hr at 90 - 130 \u00b0C and at 3-5MPa. Yields are increased by using additives such as hexamethylenetetramine or by employing chlorine - fluorine exchange in the gas phase in the presence of a transition metal - aluminum oxide catalyst. Corrosion is reduced by lowering the reaction temperature (<60 \u00b0C) and adding iron or iron compounds. This method is used to produce ... 4- chlorobenzotrifluoride ...",

Groups of F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex were administered CTFT (97% pure) by gavage in either corn oil or alpha-CD aqueous formulations daily for 14 consecutive days. The dose levels used were 10 (mice only), 50, 400, and 1000 mg/kg for corn oil vehicle and 10, 50, and 400 mg/kg (maximum achievable dose at gavage volume of 5 ml/kg) for alpha-CD vehicle. With both vehicles CTFT and alpha 2u-globulin were found to accumulate in the male rat kidney after 14 days of exposure and a dose-related toxic nephropathy was observed at dose of 50 mg/kg or higher. The hepatocellular hypertrophy and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the adrenal cortex which appeared in dosed male and female rats were also found to be independent of vehicle. Clinical pathology findings suggested a mild anemia and cholestasis in rats. With both vehicles no tissue bioaccumulation of CTFT was found in male or female mice. Vehicle-independent hepatocellular hypertrophy and cholestasis were also observed in mice at doses of 400 and 1000 mg/kg. In conclusion, the alpha-CD vehicle does not affect the toxic responses of CTFT in both sexes of both species.",

Four groups of six male and six female rats were treated daily for 28 days, by gavage, with doses of 0, 10, 100 and 1000 mg CTT/kg body weight using olive oil as a vehicle. No clinical signs were observed, other than salivation in the high-dose group in the last week. The males of this group showed a significant decrease in body-weight gain without a concurrent decrease in food consumption. In males, there were significant dose-dependent increases in blood cholesterol and triglycerides, suggestive of alterations in lipid metabolism. The females showed only a small dose-related increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase. Specific histological alterations were found in the males given 1000 mg/kg/day, namely hyaline droplet nephrosis, along with a significant increase in relative kidney weight, and an increase in lipid vacuoles in the adrenal cortex. Slight nephrosis was also observed in males given 100 mg/kg. Both male and female rats showed a significant increase in relative liver weight at a dose of 1000 mg CTT/kg. CTT appears to have a low subchronic oral toxicity. Neither pathological nor biochemical alterations were found at 10 mg/kg body weight/day and this can be defined as the no-observable-effect level (NOEL).",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7.63 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 67 days. 1-Chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1600. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. In an anaerobic screening test using digester sludge, 64% of the originally applied 1-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene was degraded in 59 days. If released into water, 1-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 110 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since 1-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene is produced or used.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). 1-Chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 110(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 3.6(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

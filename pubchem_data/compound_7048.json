For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The detoxifying metabolism of a potent rodent carcinogen, 2-nitroanisole (2-NA) by human, rabbit and rat cytochromes P450 (P450) was investigated ... HPLC with UV detection was employed for the separation and characterization of 2-NA metabolites formed by hepatic microsomes, human recombinant P450s and purified rat and rabbit P450s.  An O-demethylated metabolite of 2-NA, 2-nitrophenol (2-NP), and two oxidation products of this metabolite [2,5-dihydroxynitrobenzene (2,5-DNB) and 2,6-dihydroxynitrobenzene (2,6-DNB)] were generated by microsomes and P450s from the species investigated, but at different levels. All the metabolites are detoxication products. 2-NP is the major metabolite generated by rabbit and rat microsomes, but 2,5-DNB is the predominant product in human microsomes. Using human recombinant P450s and purified rodent P450s, we found that human P450 2E1, 1A1 and 2B6 as well as orthologous animal P450s were the most efficient enzymes oxidizing 2-NA to 2-NP, while P450 2E1 and 1A1 were the most effective in the formation of 2,5-DNB and 2,6-DNB. In human hepatic microsomes, 2-NA was oxidized mainly by P4502E1. 2-NA and its reductive metabolite o-anisidine induced rat hepatic and renal P450 1A1/2 and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), thus modifying their own detoxication and/or activation pathways. The data demonstrated the participation of orthologous P450s in 2-NA oxidation by all species and indicated that the rat and rabbit might serve as suitable models to mimic 2-NA oxidation in /humans/.",

Characterization of the products of 2-NP metabolism by rat hepatic microsomes containing cytochromes P450 (CYPs) and identification of the major CYP enzymes participating in this process are aims of this study ... Rat hepatic microsomes oxidize 2-NP to its hydroxylated metabolite, 2,5-dihydroxynitrobenzene (2,5-DNB). No nitroreductive metabolism leading to the formation of o-aminophenol was evident when using rat hepatic microsomes. Selective CYP inhibitors and hepatic microsomes of rats pre-treated with specific CYP inducers were used to characterize CYPs oxidizing 2-NP in rat livers. Based on these studies, we attribute most of 2-NP oxidation in rat liver to CYP2E1 and 3A, followed by CYP2D and 2C. Among recombinant rat CYP enzymes tested in this study, CYP2E1 and 2C11 were the most effective enzymes oxidizing 2-NP. Oxidation of 2-NP by rat CYP2E1 exhibits the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, having the Km value of 0.35 mM. The results found in this study ... demonstrate that CYP2E1 is the major enzyme oxidizing this compound in rat liver.",

Human hepatic microsomes generated a pattern of 2-NA metabolites, reproducing that formed by hepatic microsomes of rats and rabbits. An O-demethylated metabolite of 2-NA (2-nitrophenol) and two ring-oxidized derivatives of this metabolite (2,6-dihydroxynitrobenzene and 2,X-dihydroxynitrobenzene) were produced. No nitroreductive metabolism leading to the formation of o-anisidine was evident with hepatic microsomes of any species. Likewise, no DNA binding of 2-NA metabolite(s) measured with either tritium-labeled 2-NA or the (32)P-postlabeling technique was detectable in microsomes. Therefore, hepatic microsomal P450 enzymes participate in the detoxication reactions of this environmental carcinogen. Using hepatic microsomes of rabbits pretreated with specific P450 inducers, microsomes from Baculovirus transfected insect cells expressing recombinant human P450 enzymes, purified P450 enzymes, and selective P450 inhibitors, /the authors/ found that human recombinant P450 2E1, 1A1, and 2B6, as well as orthologous rodent P450 enzymes, are the most efficient enzymes metabolizing 2-NA. The role of specific P450 enzymes in the metabolism of 2-NA in human hepatic microsomes was investigated by correlating specific P450-dependent reactions with the levels of 2-NA metabolites formed by the same microsomes and by examining the effects of specific inhibitors of P450 enzymes on 2-NA metabolism. On the basis of these studies, ... most of the 2-NA oxidation metabolism in human microsomes /was attributed/ to P450 2E1. These results ... clearly demonstrate that P450 2E1 is the major human enzyme oxidizing this carcinogen in human liver.",

                                "Description": "In general, the occupational exposure limit (OEL) indicates the level of admissible exposure, for a length of time (usually 8 hours), to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health of a worker. The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The level of DNA single-strand breaks in mononuclear blood cells was detected by alkaline elution. The results were compared for 16 fire fighters who worked in a contaminated area for about 8 hr and two reference groups (one of fire fighters who had not worked in the contaminated area, group I, and one of persons without any apparent occupational exposure to genotoxic substances, group II). The mean normalized elution rate (nER) 19 d after the accident was slightly but statistically significantly (P < 0.05) higher for the exposed fire fighters [mean 1.48 +/- 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.21] than for reference group I (mean 1.21 +/- 95% CI 0.21) or reference group II (mean 1.17 +/- 95% CI 0.18). No statistically significant difference was found between reference groups I and II. Another analysis was performed three months after the first. The level of DNA single-strand breaks (mean nER 1.12 +/- 95% CI 0.11) was no longer increased in comparison with the levels of the reference groups ...",

The mechanism of its carcinogenicity was investigated in this study ... Two independent methods, (32)P-post-labeling and (3)H-labeled 2-NA, /were used/ to show that 2-NA binds covalently to DNA in vitro after reductive activation by human hepatic cytosol and xanthine oxidase (XO) ... The capacity of 2-NA to form DNA adducts in vivo /was also investigated/. Male Wistar rats were treated ip with 2-NA (0.15 mg/kg bw daily for 5 days) and DNA from several organs was analyzed by (32)P-post-labeling. Two 2-NA-specific DNA adducts, identical to those found in DNA incubated with 2-NA and human hepatic cytosol or XO in vitro, were detected in the urinary bladder (3.4 adducts/10(7) nt), the target organ, and, to a lesser extent, in liver, kidney and spleen. The two DNA adducts found in rat tissues in vivo were identified as deoxyguanosine adducts derived from a 2-NA reductive metabolite, N-(2-methoxyphenyl)hydroxylamine. This reactive metabolite of 2-NA was identified in incubations with human hepatic cytosol, besides 2-methoxyaniline (o-anisidine).

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.6X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-nitroanisole will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-nitroanisole will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.6 days. 2-Nitroanisole absorbs light at wavelengths up to 429 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-nitroanisole is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 140. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.3X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Nitroanisole may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The compound required more than 64 days to biodegrade in a soil microflora inoculum, indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, 2-nitroanisole is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF range of 1.4-5.2 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-nitroanisole may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-nitroanisole is produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 2-nitroanisole is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.6 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.5X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 2-Nitroanisole absorbs light at wavelengths up to 429 nm(4), and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

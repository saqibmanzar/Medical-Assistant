PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Patients with localized pelvic recurrence or persistence demonstrated no complete responses & a 21% overall response rate. Isolated chest metastases responded more frequently to cisplatin than pelvic recurrences (73% vs 22%, p=0.0007); however, location of recurrence did not significantly alter survival (mean 22.7 mo vs 14.1 mo; p=0.24). Concomitant disease in other locations reduced the likelihood of response in the chest (p>0.05) by virtue of lack of response in those other sites. Lesion size, clinical stage, patient age, & duration from primary treatment to recurrence were not of significance with regard to response or survival.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

High concns of the anion stabilize the drug, explaining the effectiveness of chloride diuresis in preventing nephrotoxicity. ... The platinum complexes can react with DNA, forming both intrastrand & interstrand cross-links. The N(7) of guanine is very reactive, & platinum cross-links between adjacent guanines on the same DNA strand; guanine-adenine cross-links also readily form. The formation of interstrand crosslinks is a slower process & occurs to a lesser extent. DNA adducts formed by cisplatin inhibit DNA replication & transcription & lead to breaks & miscoding. The ability of patients to form & sustain DNA-platinum adducts in peripheral white blood cells has been correlated with response to treatment, indicating that pharmacogenetic factors or environmental exposures common to tumor & normal tissues may influence response. At present, there is no conclusive association between a single type of biochemical DNA adduct & cytotoxicity. The specificity of cisplatin with regard to phase of the cell cycle appears to differ among cell types, although the effects on cross-linking are most pronounced during the S phase.",

Inhibition was essentially instantaneous and irreversible to G-25 gel filtration. The site of inhibition was found to be the B1 subunit. Transplatin was much less effective. Inhibition of the enzyme by cis-platin (molar ratio cis-platin:B1 = 4.3) led to a decr in thiol titre corresponding to approx 1 thiol group per dimer of B1 subunits under conditions leading to 94% inactivation of the ribonucleotide reductase activity.",

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of cisplatin was based on a solvent generated anion exchange system with quenched phosphorescence detection. Analyses were performed on columns prepared by material coated with hexadecyltrimethylammonium/bromide. The quenched phosphorescence detection method was based on measuring room temperature phosphorescence of biacetyl present as a solute in the deoxygenated eluent. Analytes interacted with biacetyl to cause a decrease in phosphorescence signal intensity. Concentrations of cisplatin were varied from 2.5 to 7.5 umol/l. The developed method was applied to urine samples spiked with cisplatin. Peaks for cisplatin were clearly seen by the method with a retention time of 2.5 minutes. Detection limits were 0.3 umol/l for cisplatin.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma involving the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder and/or urethra.  In combination with radiation treatment to treat bilharzial bladder cancer and together with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide to treat locally advanced bladder cancer.  The palliative treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinomas of the head or neck.  Treatment of lung cancer, principally as a component of various chemotherapeutic regimens in the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinomas.  It is often combined with other agents such as etoposide, vinblastine or vindesine to obtain a better response rate in lung cancer.  Its use alone has some value but in combination the results are more noticeable   in the palliative treatment of recurrent or advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and metastatic testicular carcinoma.  Other types of carcinomas in which cisplatin has been tried included the following: osteogenic sarcoma, neuroblastoma and recurrent brain tumors in children, advanced esophageal carcinoma and advanced prostatic carcinoma. In combination with agents such as bleomycin, methotrexate, vincristine or vinblastine, fluorouracil in various regimes (all together or singularly depending on the protocol and the carcinoma type).  Combinations of these agents have been reported to have a better response rate than if cisplatin were used alone. HUMAN EXPOSURE: Summary: Main Risks and Target Organs: The main risks experienced during cisplatin therapy and overdosage include nephrotoxicity, electrolyte disturbances, myelosuppression, neurotoxicity, anaphylactic reactions and ototoxicity. Nausea and vomiting can be severe. Rarer risks include cardiovascular effects, ocular effects, and hepatic effects.  Most effects of overdosage are not usually seen immediately, but occur several days to months after the event.  The causes of death from an overdose from cisplatin include myelosuppression, renal failure and tetany. Summary of Clinical Effects: Renal toxicity is cumulative and seen usually after several courses of cisplatin or after overdose. Disturbances in electrolytes can be a long term manifestation due to the cisplatin induced renal tubular dysfunction.  Hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia and hypokalemia are commonly seen in cisplatin induced renal toxicity and can persist for months after termination of therapy.  Hematological effects of cisplatin (myelosuppression and anemia) are cumulative and in overdosage the hematopoietic system must be supported to prevent complications of infection.  Cisplatin induces marked nausea and vomiting in almost all patients.  Anaphylactoid reactions have occurred during normal therapy with cisplatin and must be treated vigorously. Cisplatin causes electrolyte disturbances which are a direct result of cisplatin induced renal tubular dysfunction.  Cisplatin causes marked excretion of calcium, magnesium and potassium and to a lesser extent zinc, copper and amino acids. These disturbances must be corrected to prevent complications. Clinical features: Renal toxicity is manifested by an increase in serum creatinine, BUN, serum uric acid and/or a decrease in creatinine clearance and glomerular filtration rate.  The renal impairment is a direct result of cisplatin induced renal tubular damage leading ultimately to renal failure.  Disturbances have been seen in serum electrolytes due principally to cisplatin induced renal tubular dysfunction.  Patients subsequently develop Hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia and hypokalemia and to a lesser extent hypophosphatemia and hyponatremia.  Cisplatin produces marked nausea and vomiting in almost all patients to the extent that some patients experience anticipatory nausea and vomiting.  Diarrhea has also occurred but with less frequency than nausea and vomiting.  Ototoxicity develops in various degrees on cisplatin therapy.  In larger and prolonged dosing with cisplatin the ototoxicity can be irreversible. Myelosuppression is a common problem seen as leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia and if severe enough can cause the death of the patient.  Myelosuppression can be cumulative.  Anaphylactoid reactions can occur when cisplatin is given.  Cardiovascular effects are rare but include bradycardia, left bundle branch block and congestive heart failure.  Hepatic enzyme activities in the sera become elevated including AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT). Precautions: Extreme care should be taken by persons preparing and administering cisplatin and those handling the urine of treated patients. Routes of entry: Cisplatin is not effective when administered orally. Dermal: Cisplatin is not administered dermally.  Avoid dermal contact and absorption during administration. Eye: Eye contamination may be a possible source of poisoning during intravenous administration of cisplatin. Parenteral: Cisplatin is only available in the injectable form.  The parenteral routes, intravenous, intra-arterial and intraperitoneal, have all been used in cisplatin therapy and poisoning would most likely occur by these three routes. Absorption by route of exposure: Intravenous: Totally absorbed after intravenous use. Rapid intravenous injection of cisplatin over 1 to 5 minutes or rapid intravenous infusion over 15 minutes or one hour, results in peak plasma concentrations immediately.  When cisplatin is administered by intravenous infusion over 6 to 24 hours the plasma concentrations of total platinum increase gradually during the infusion and reach peak concentrations immediately following the end of the infusions.  When mannitol is given at the same time as cisplatin, the peak plasma concentrations of non protein-bound platinum appears to be increased. Intra-arterial: When cisplatin is administered by intra-arterial infusion, the local tumor exposure of the drug is increased as compared with intravenous administration. Intraperitoneal: Cisplatin is rapidly and well absorbed systemically following intraperitoneal administration.  This route gives 50 to 100% plasma concentration in comparison with the intravenous route.  Intraperitoneal fluid concentration of the drug is greatly increased as compared with intravenous administration. Distribution by route of exposure: Following the intravenous administration of Cisplatin, the drug is widely distributed into body fluids and tissues.  The highest concentrations can be seen in the kidneys, liver and intestines, and can persist for up to 2 to 4 weeks.  However, concentrations can also be found in the muscles, bladder, testes, prostate, pancreas and spleen. Cisplatin has also been found in the following tissues; small and large intestines, adrenals, heart, lungs, lymph nodes, thyroid, gall bladder, thymus, cerebrum, cerebellum, ovaries and uterus.  Platinum appears to accumulate in body tissues following administration of cisplatin and has been detected in many of these tissues for up to 6 months after the last dose of the drug.  Platinum also has been found in leucocytes and erythrocytes.  Cisplatin and any platinum-containing products are rapidly and extensively bound to tissue and plasma proteins, including albumin, gamma-globulins and transferrin.  Binding to tissue and plasma proteins appears to be essentially irreversible with the bound platinum remaining in plasma during the lifespan of the albumin molecule.  Protein binding increases with time and less than 2 to 10% of platinum in blood remains unbound several hours after intravenous administration of cisplatin.  The extent of protein binding is about 90% and this occurs essentially within the first two hours after a dose. Penetration into the central nervous system (CNS) does not occur readily.  The resultant levels are low in the CNS, but significant amounts of cisplatin can be detected in intracerebral tumor tissue and edematous brain tissue adjacent to the tumor.  In healthy brain tissue concentrations appear to be low. Metabolism: The metabolic fate of cisplatin has not been completely elucidated.  There is little evidence to date that the drug undergoes enzymatic biotransformation. The cisplatin molecule has chloride ligands on it and it is believed that these are displaced by water thus forming positively charged platinum complexes that react with nucleophilic sites. Their rate and extent depends on the strength, concentration and accessibility of the nucleophiles.  The chemical identities of the metabolites of cisplatin have been found but have yet to be identified. There is a strong possibility that cisplatin and its metabolites undergo enterohepatic circulation. Elimination by route of exposure: Intact cisplatin and its metabolites are excreted principally in urine.  It occurs predominantly via glomerular filtration but there is some evidence that secretion and reabsorption of cisplatin and its metabolites also occurs.  Initially renal clearance of total platinum equals creatinine clearance and represents elimination of non-protein bound platinum molecules including intact cisplatin.  As extensive protein binding occurs then clearance declines rapidly, resulting in a prolonged excretory phase.  The ultimate rate of fall of total plasma platinum concentration is governed by the rate of degradation of plasma proteins bearing bound platinum.  A small amount of cisplatin is excreted via the bile and saliva. Elimination half-life of cisplatin (Adults): Normal renal function: 2 to 72 hr.  End stage renal disease: 1 to 240 hr.  Mode of Action: Toxicodynamics: Cisplatin appears to be cycle-phase nonspecific and will cause cell death in all cells.  It is in those cells which turn over rapidly (tumor cells, skin cells, gastrointestinal cells, bone marrow cells) that cell death will occur at a faster rate than other cells with a slower turnover rate (e.g. muscle cells).  Cisplatin exerts its antineoplastic activity when it has the cis-configuration and without a charge on the molecule.  The trans-configuration is inactive. Pharmacodynamics: Cisplatin complex moves through cell membranes in an unionized form and this is achieved in the relatively high chloride concentration in the plasma.  Intracellularly the concentration of chloride ions is lower than in the plasma and the chloride ligands on the cisplatin complex are displaced by water.  The result is the formation of positively charged platinum complexes that are toxic to cells.  The cisplatin molecule binds to the DNA molecule at the guanine bases and thus inhibits DNA synthesis, protein and RNA synthesis (the latter two are inhibited to a lesser degree).  The drug forms intrastrand and interstrand cross links in the DNA molecule and appears to correlate well with the cytotoxicity of the drug.  The tumor cells amass an overburden of mutations which lead eventually to the cell's death.  Cisplatin also has immunosuppressive, radiosensitizing and antimicrobial properties.  The exact mechanism of action of cisplatin is not yet understood but the drug has biochemical properties similar to those of bifunctional alkylating agents. Human Data: Adults: The major toxicity caused during cisplatin treatment is dose related and cumulative.  For example, renal tubular function impairment can occur during the second week of therapy and if higher doses or repeated courses of cisplatin are given then irreversible renal damage can occur. Teratogenicity: There is positive evidence of human fetal risk, so the benefits in pregnant women must be weighed against the risk. Interactions: Nephrotoxic drugs: Cisplatin produces cumulative nephrotoxicity that can be potentiated by nephrotoxic drugs (aminoglycosides, cephalosporins and amphoteracin). Aminoglycosides: Concurrent administration of aminoglycosides within 1-2 weeks of cisplatin therapy has been associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity and renal failure.  Therefore aminoglycosides should be used with extreme care during treatment. Cisplatin ototoxicity is enhanced with the use of loop diuretics. ANIMAL STUDIES: Cisplatin is carcinogenic in animals. Mutagenicity: Cisplatin is mutagenic in bacterial cultures and produces chromosome aberrations in animal cells in tissue cultures.",

There is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of etoposide given in combination with cisplatin and bleomycin. There is inadequate evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of etoposide. Overall evaluation: Etoposide is probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A). In reaching this evaluation, the Working Group noted that etoposide causes distinctive cytogenetic lesions in leukemic cells that can be readily distinguished from those induced by alkylating agents. The short latency of these leukemias contrasts with that of leukemia induced by alkylating agents. Potent protein masked DNA breakage and clastogenic effects occur in human cells in vitro and animal cells in vivo. Etoposide in combination with cisplatin or bleomycin is carcinogenic to humans. /Etoposide in combination with cisplatin or bleomycin/",

Cisplatin additively incr the cytotoxic effects of etoposide, mitomycin C, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, but antagonized those of vincristine, vindesine, vinblastine and podophyllotoxin. The antagonism between cisplatin and vincristine was also observed with HT29 colon cancer cells, NC65 renal carcinoma cells and A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells when these cells were simultaneously exposed to both agents. When A549 cells were exposed to cisplatin and vincristine sequentially (6 hr incubation with each agent), the antagonism between them was evident when the cells were pretreated with cisplatin, but not when treated in the opposite sequence.",

Human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (tumor line AB and EH) xenografted to nude mice were used. Two administration schedules were tested: (a) metoclopramide (2.0 mg/kg ip) given 1 hr before cis-platin (7.5 mg/kg ip); and (b) metoclopramide (3 x 2.0 mg/kg) given concomitant to, 24, and 48 hr after cis-platin (7.5 mg/kg) administration. Treatment efficacies were compared using the area under the growth curves, tumor vol, and specific growth delay. There was no mortality and no wt loss of significance in any treatment group. Metoclopramide alone did not induce any significant reduction in area under the growth curves tumor vol, or specific growth delay with either treatment schedule. Cis-platin alone gave a significant reduction of tumor growth in tumor line AB but not in tumor line EH. In schedule (a), the addition of metoclopramide did not give any additive effect. In schedule (b), for both tumor lines, metoclopramide enhanced the effect of cis-platin by significantly reducing the area under the growth curves (AB: p < 0.0001; EH: p < 0.001) and incr specific growth delay (AB: p < 0.012; EH: p < 0.001) when compared to the tumors given cis-platin alone.",

If released into the environment, cis-diaminedichloroplatinum will leach through soil based on its water solubility and the stability of its transformation product, trans-diaminedichloroplatinum. cis-Diaminedichloroplatinum will slowly convert to trans-diaminedichloroplatinum in water. Abiotic or biotic processes can convert cis-diaminedichloroplatinum into ionic species that will enhance its adsorption capability to soil materials. The trans- form may remain predominantly in the dissolved form unless it is transferred to sediments by precipitation or adsorption resulting from biotic or abiotic processes. Exposure of hospital workers to cis-diaminedichloroplatinum may occur with its use as a chemotherapy drug. (SRC)",

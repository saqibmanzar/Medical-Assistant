When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this sharp-smelling, reddish liquid may occur from its use in organic synthesis. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, respiratory irritation, pulmonary edema, and death. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus, and protective clothing specifically recommended by the shipper or producer. If contact should occur, immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, and remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. While thiophosgene does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of poisonous gases (eg, phosgene). In addition, thiophosgene decomposes above 200 \u00b0C to carbon disulfide (very flammable) and carbon tetrachloride. Containers may explode violently in the heat of a fire. Fires involving thiophosgene may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, fog, or standard foam. Fight the fire from as far a distance as possible. Thiophosgene may be shipped via air (cargo only), rail (cargo only), road, and water, in containers bearing the label, \"Poison\". Small spills of thiophosgene may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. Large spills should be diked far ahead of the spill area to prevent thiophosgene from entering water sources and sewers. Spilled material may be neutralized with crushed limestone, soda ash, or lime. Before implementing land disposal of waste thiophosgene, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

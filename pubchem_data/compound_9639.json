When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The study was part of a program to investigate possible health hazards presented by candidate Halon replacements for use as a fire extinguishant. Male Fischer-344-rats and Sprague-Dawley-rats were exposed nose only to 10,000 parts per million (ppm) HCFC-123, HCFC-124, HCFC-142b, or PFH for 2 hours. Urine samples were collected for 24 hours. The rats were killed 0 or 24 hours after exposure and the tissue distribution of the compounds and their metabolites was determined by gas chromatography and fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. HCFC-123, HCFC-124, HCFC-142b, and PFH were detected in all tissues of rats killed immediately after exposure. ... Most tissue concentrations of the halocarbons and metabolites were below the detection limit in rats examined 24 hours post exposure. ... No PFH metabolites were detected /in urine/. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 218 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates perfluoro-n-hexane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase perfluoro-n-hexane has an estimated atmospheric life-time of 3070 to 3200 years. Perfluoro-n-hexane has 20-, 100- and 500-year Global Warming Potentials of 4500, 6800 and 9900, respectively. Perfluoro-n-hexane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, perfluoro-n-hexane is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 8X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10+4 atm-cu m/mole. Perfluoro-n-hexane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, perfluoro-n-hexane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 7 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 2 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 720 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to perfluoro-n-hexane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where perfluoro-n-hexane is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may have limited exposure to perfluoro-n-hexane via ultrasound medical imaging. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10+4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 7 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 2 years if adsorption is considered(4). Perfluoro-n-hexane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 720(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 4.83(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC).

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

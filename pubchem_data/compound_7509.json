PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

These substances may be metabolized along several pathways. Simple aliphatic and aromatic thiols undergo S-methylation in mammals to produce the corresponding methyl thioether or sulfide. Methylation is catalysed by thiopurine methyltransferase in the cytoplasm and thiol methyltransferase in microsomes, and both reactions require S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl group donor. Thiopurine methyltransferase is present in human liver, kidney, and erythrocytes; preferential substrates for this enzyme include aromatic and heterocyclic thiols. S-Methylation of aliphatic thiols is catalysed by microsomal thiol methyltransferase, and the resulting methyl thioether (sulfide) metabolite would undergo S-oxidation to give the methyl sulfoxide and methyl sulfone analogues as urinary products. /Thiols/",

Methylation is catalysed by thiopurine methyltransferase in the cytoplasm and thiol methyltransferase in microsomes, and both reactions require S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl group donor. Thiopurine methyltransferase is present in human liver, kidney, and erythrocytes; preferential substrates for this enzyme include aromatic and heterocyclic thiols. S-Methylation of aliphatic thiols is catalysed by microsomal thiol methyltransferase, and the resulting methyl thioether (sulfide) metabolite would undergo S-oxidation to give the methyl sulfoxide and methyl sulfone analogues as urinary products. Thiols may react with glutathione and other endogenous thiol substances to form mixed disulfides. Both microsomal and cytoplasmic thioltransferasess have been reported to catalyse the formation of mixed disulfides. The resulting mixed disulfides can undergo reduction back to thiols, oxidative desulfuration, or oxidation to a sulfonic acid via the intermediate thiosulfinate and sulfinic acids. The principal form in the circulation would probably be a mixed disulfide formed with albumin. /Simple thiols/",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

It occurs in coffee. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.47 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzyl mercaptan will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzyl mercaptan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 hours. Benzyl mercaptan does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzyl mercaptan is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 520. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Benzyl mercaptan is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, benzyl mercaptan is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation data were not available. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 hours and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 16 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to benzyl mercaptan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzyl mercaptan is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzyl mercaptan ingestion of food products containing benzyl mercaptan as a flavoring. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase benzyl mercaptan is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.5X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

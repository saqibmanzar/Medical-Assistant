PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The reaction generally starts at elevated temperatures and proceeds exothermically. The second step is the conversion of the monoester to a diester with the formation of water. This is a reversible reaction and proceeds more slowly than the first, thus determining the overall rate of reaction. To shift the equilibrium towards the diester, the water of reaction is removed by distillation. The rate of reaction can be influenced by the choice of catalyst and the reaction temperature. For fast conversion rates, high reaction temperatures are generally used. However, these are influenced by the boiling point of the alcohol and/or the type of catalyst. ... Currently, nearly all major phthalate producers use amphoteric catalysts for the esterification of high boiling alcohols. ... The reaction temperatures for the amphoteric catalysts are about 200 \u00b0C. At this temperature side reactions are minimized, and the alcohol can be recycled without purification. By using this type of catalyst, over 99.5 % conversion to diester can be achieved. /Phthalates/",

Oxygen and carbon dioxide gas diffusion properties of PVC-DnDP films were respectively, 1.6 and 2 times those of standard PVC-di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate films. The amounts of DnDP leaked into the plasma of PCs were low at 0.58 +/- 0.06 mg per bag after 5-day storage, which is about 1/80 the amount of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate leaked. The pH of PCs in PVC-DnDP bags amounted to 6.99 +/- 0.03 after 5-day storage, with glycolysis accelerated somewhat in the new bags. However, the platelet oxygen consumption was no different from that in the PVC-di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate bags. Platelet aggregation and response to hypotonic shock were significantly better in the new bags at the end of storage. Shape changes of platelets into spherical forms with dendrites were more frequently observed in PVC-DnDP bags than in PVC-di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate bags. The study indicated that platelets stored in the new DnDP-plasticized PVC bags have retained aggregation and response to hypotonic shock more than platelets in the PVC-di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate bags, but spherical forms and anaerobic metabolism increased in the new bags.",

The mutagenicity-enhancing ability may be related to the induction of enzymes such as P450IIB, that metabolize amino acid pyrolysates. By quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, a good correlation was observed between the mutagenicity-enhancing activity of phthalates and their octanol-water partition coefficients.",

Phthalate esters have been tested with six species of microorganisms, including bacteria and protozoans. Fifteen algal species have been tested, including green and bluegreen algae in both freshwater and saltwater. Nineteen freshwater and saltwater invertebrate species inhabiting surface waters and sediments and 21 freshwater and saltwater fish inhabiting cold and warm water bodies have been tested. The results of most studies indicate that acute and chronic toxicity to microorganisms, algae, aquatic invertebrates, and fish are limited to the lower molecular weight phthalate esters (i.e., dimethyl-, diethyl-, diallyl-, dipropyl-, dibutyl-, diisobutyl-, and butylbenzylphthalate). In contrast, higher molecular weight phthalate esters are not acutely or chronically toxic to aquatic organisms. Although conflicting data on chronic effects for high molecular weight phthalate esters have been reported for daphnids, these inconsistencies are attributed to physical effects imposed on daphnids when exposed to test concentrations in excess of true water solubilities. Altogether, nearly 400 test results covering more than 60 species of microorganisms, algae, invertebrates, and fish are reported for both freshwater and saltwater aquatic species. While most investigators used several common species and standard protocols to assay conventional endpoints, many nontraditional species and toxicological endpoints were also used. This has created a toxicological database of both sufficient depth to compare many similar tests and sufficient breadth to encompass virtually al important types of aquatic habitats and classes of aquatic species.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.9X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates didecyl phthalate will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase didecyl phthalate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Didecyl phthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, didecyl phthalate is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2.0X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Didecyl phthalate is expected to biodegrade based on a study using an inoculum obtained from soil and sewage sludge, didecyl phthalate, as a mixture with dioctyl and dihexyl phthalate, underwent greater than 99% primary biodegradation under aerobic conditions in 28 days. If released into water, didecyl phthalate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Didecyl phthalate is expected to biodegrade in water based on a river die-away test where didecyl phthalate, present at 1 ug/L, had a half-life of 1.4 days. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 28 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 600 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 7.7 years and 280 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively, suggest that hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process. Occupational exposure to didecyl phthalate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where didecyl phthalate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to didecyl phthalate via inhalation of particulates and dermal contact with consumer products containing didecyl phthalate. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.0 and 28 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 600 years if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 7.7 years and 280 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively, suggest that hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process(8). Didecyl phthalate, present at 1 ug/L, had a half-life of 1.4 days in a river die-away test(9). Didecyl phthalate underwent 1% biodegradation after 15 days using a settled domestic wastewater inoculum, and approximately 10% biodegradation in 15 days after the inoculum was acclimated to this compound(10).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that didecyl phthalate is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 3.0 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 28 days(SRC). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 600 years when adsorption is considered(3). Didecyl phthalate's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Didecyl phthalate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 7.9X10-9 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(4).",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

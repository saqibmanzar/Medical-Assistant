PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

The mother was salivating markedly and her pupils were reduced to \"pinpoint size.\" An uncorrected metabolic acidosis was diagnosed. Serum and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase determinations were near zero. Cholinesterase inhibitor poisoning was felt to be the likely cause of her disorders. Administration of atropine 2.4 mg iv bolus with infusion of 0.02 mg/kg/hr lead to unacceptable fetal tachycardia. The woman had shown increased cooperativeness and secretion control until the atropine had to be stopped. A cesarean section was performed for delivery of a hypotonic infant with a 1 min Apgar score of 3. The baby was mechanically ventilated for 2 days and required atropine therapy at 0.1 mg/kg/hr for 8 days. The mother required 8 days of mechanical ventilation and 11 days of atropine therapy. In this case, the infant appeared relatively less poisoned than the mother by a presumed organophosphate exposure. /Organophosphate poisoning/[Haddad, L.M., Clinical Management of Poisoning and Drug Overdose. 2nd ed.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.3X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethoate-methyl will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethoate-methyl will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours. Particulate-phase ethoate-methyl will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Ethoate-methyl does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethoate-methyl is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 45. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, ethoate-methyl is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Ethoate-methyl may undergo hydrolysis in moist soils and water, but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown. Structurally similar dimethoate had reported hydrolysis half-lives of 118 days (pH 7) and 3.7 days (pH 9). Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since ethoate-methyl is no longer produced or used in the US (2006). (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

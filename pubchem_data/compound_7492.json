If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This study describes a subcellular nitroreductase activity which occurs in liver mitochondria under aerobic conditions. Mitochondria were isolated from rat liver and assayed for their capacity to reduce certain nitro compounds by measuring spectrophotometrically both the appearance of amino compounds and the consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Intact mitochondria were found to possess a p-dinitrobenzene reductase activity. The activity was destroyed by heat, and was present at only 20% in the microsomal fraction. It was strictly nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent, while only little or no activity occurred with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or other oxidative substrates. Nitro reduction was inhibited by thiol reagent. Rat liver mitochondria showed about 15% activity with o-dinitrobenzene and m-dinitrobenzene, while there was less than 5% activity with a series of p-nitro compounds including chloramphenicol.",

The major metabolite of o-dinitrobenzene in similar incubations was S-(2-nitrophenyl)glutathione which represented 48.1 + or - 5.5% of the total radioactivity; o-nitroaniline accounted for 29.5 + or - 2.1% of the radioactivity. Incubation of dinitrobenzene with microsomes produced nitroanilines as well as nitrosonitrobenzenes and nitrophenylhydroxylamines. Reduction of o- and m-dinitrobenzene by microsomes was reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dependent. Reduction of p-dinitrobenzene could be supported by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as well as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, although the rate of reduction was slower with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, dermal absorption), exposure to this colorless-to yellow, crystalline substance may occur from its production or use in the synthesis of dyes and as a camphor substitute in cellulose nitrate. Effects from exposure may include headache, nausea, vision impairment, contact burns to the skin and eyes, cardiac arrhythmias, methemaglobinemia, cyanosis, hepatic injury, and respiratory failure.  Effects may be delayed for up to 1-4 hours. OSHA has established a time-weighted-average (TWA) exposure limit of 1 mg/cu m, with a skin designation.  In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, where a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and chemical protective clothing which is specifically recommended by the shipper or manufacturer.  No skin should be exposed. If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin with soap and water. Contaminated clothing and sho es should be removed and left at the site for cleaning or disposal. While 1,4-dinitrobenzene does not ignite easily, it may explode by impact, contact with strong oxidizers, or heat under confinement that will permit high pressure build-up.  For fires involving this substance, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, regular foam (for dinitrobenzene solution), or alcoh ol foam (for dinitrobenzene solid).  Evacuate area of massive fire, and fight from as far a distance as possible.  1,4-Dinitrobenzene may be shipped via air, rail, road, and water, in containers bearing the label, \"Poison.\" This substance should be stored away from heat, sparks, flames, and other sources of ignition,protected from physical damage, and separated from oxidizers, combustibles, metals (eg, tin and zinc), and caustics.  For small dry spills of this substance, use a clean shovel to place material into a clean, dry container for later disposal (liquid solutions are taken up with sand or other noncombustible material).  Large land spills (liquid solutions) should be diked far ahead of the spill for later disposal. Do not allow the material to ent er water sources or sewers.  Large dry spills should be covered with a plastic sheet to prevent dissolving in the rain.  For spills in water, use sand bag barriers to trap material at the bottom, apply activated carbon, and use mechanical dredges or lifts to remove immobilized masses.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

If heat and reaction conditions of the nitration are not controlled, detonation comparable to TNT may occur [Anon., J. R. Inst. Chem., 1960, 84, p. 451]. Mixture of 1,3-dinitrobenzene with tetranitromethane was found highly explosive [Urbanski, 1964, vol. 1, 592]. 1,2-dinitrobenzene is a severe explosion hazard when shocked or exposed to heat or flame. When heated to decomposition all dinitrobenzens emit toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides [Sax, 9th ed., 1996, p. 1374].",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.5X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,4-dinitrobenzene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,4-dinitrobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 753 days. 1,4-Dinitrobenzene absorbs light at wavelengths greater than 290 nm and may be susceptible to direct photolysis, but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown. Particulate-phase 1,4-dinitrobenzene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, 1,4-dinitrobenzene is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 150. However, 1,4-dinitrobenzene adsorbs strongly to clay surfaces and the mobility of 1,4-dinitrobenzene is expected to be low in soils rich in clay content. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. 1,4-Dinitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. More than 64 days were required to biodegrade 1,4-dinitrobenzene in an aqueous biodegradation screening test using a silt loam inoculum at 25 \u00b0C, which suggests biodegradation will occur slowly in soil and water. If released into water, 1,4-dinitrobenzene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process for 1,4-dinitrobenzene in water or moist soil since this compound lacks functional groups that undergo hydrolysis under environmental conditions. BCF values of 2-38 measured in fish suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Occupational exposure to 1,4-dinitrobenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,4-dinitrobenzene is produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 1,4-dinitrobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 753 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.1X10-14 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C (SRC) determined using a structure estimation method(3). 1,4-Dinitrobenzene absorbs light greater than 290 nm and may be susceptible to direct photolysis(4), but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown(SRC).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 753 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Nitrobenzenes absorb light greater than 290 nm(2), which suggests that 1,4-dinitrobenzene may be susceptible to direct photolysis in the environment(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Exposure to 4-bromotoluene may occur through inhalation or dermal contact at sites where the substance is manufactured, used as a solvent, or used as a chemical intermediate. This substance is to be considered hazardous to health, with the potential to cause respiratory irritation and CNS depression. Entry into contaminated areas warrants the wearing of full-face mask, self-contained breathing apparatus which provides eye protection. This substance is normally stable, even under fire conditions; requiring moderate heating before ignition will occur (flash point 85 \u00b0C, closed cup). Normal procedures may be used to fight a 4-bromotoluene fire; extinguishing with water spray that blankets the fire and cools the substance below its flash point. Before transporting 4-bromotoluene, the regulatory requirements of the DOT must be consulted. Prior to implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

If released to the atmosphere, 4-bromotoluene is expected to degrade by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction is estimated to be 9.8 days. If released to water, 4-bromotoluene may be removed from the water column by volatilization and adsorption. Using an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-3 atm-cu m/mol, volatilization half-lives of 4.3 hr and 5.3 days can be estimated for a model river and model lake, respectively. The potential effect of adsorption to sediment is considered in the half-life from an environmental pond which is estimated to be 14.9 days, but not from the model river or model lake. An estimated Koc value of 430 suggests that if 4-bromotoluene is released to soil, moderate leaching may occur. Based on its estimated Henry's Law constant and measured vapor pressure (1.15 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C), evaporation from dry and moist surface soil may also occur. Data are insufficent to assess the importance of biodegradation in the environment. Its estimated BCF of 230 suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderately high. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation or dermal contact at sites where 4-bromotoluene is manufactured, used as a solvent or used as a chemical intermediate. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

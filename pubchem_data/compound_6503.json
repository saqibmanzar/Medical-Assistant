PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The drug should be administered through a large needle or indwelling catheter to minimize venous irritation by the highly alkaline tromethamine solution. Extravasation may result in inflammation, necrosis, and sloughing of overlying skin. If perivascular infiltration occurs, tromethamine administration should be discontinued immediately. Infiltration of the affected area with 1% procaine hydrochloride, to which hyaluronidase has been added, will often reduce venospasm and also will dilute any tromethamine remaining in the tissues locally. Local infiltration of an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, such as phentolamine mesylate, into the vasospastic area has been recommended. If necessary, nerve block of autonomic fibers to the affected area may be performed.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

In 5 and in 240 days old rats the renal excretion of THAM was slower than in rats of other age groups. Stimulation of diuresis by i.p. injection of mannitol, thiazide or by oral water load resulted in an increase in THAM excretion in 5 and in 240 days old rats. The renal excretion of THAM was also increased by repeated administration of THAM in all age groups, except in new born rats. Possible mechanisms of action are discussed.",

The following results were obtained: An equilibrium in the distribution of THAM between ECS and ICS will not occur before 6-12 hours after administration. This indicates that THAM permeates very slowly into the intracellular compartment, which is in contrast to the general assumption that it quickly diffuses into the intracellular space to restore the intracellular acidosis. THAM disappears from the extracellular space in a multiexponential fashion, indicating that it equilibrates with the different body tissues at largely variable rates. The equilibrium which occurs between both body compartments 6-12 hours after THAM application does not agree with the values which are expected for transfer of only the nonionised substance. At plasma pH 7.4 and a \"mean whole body pHi\" of 6.88, THAM is distributed with a distribution ratio of 4 (ICS/ECS), a value quite different from the value of 11 which would be expected for exclusive nonionic diffusion. Thus THAM is also transferred across the cell membrane in ionized form. These results indicate that the influx of THAM into the intracellular space is too slow (when compared to the renal elimination kinetics) to influence intracellular pH significantly by direct buffer action. Moreover, only a fraction of THAM enters the intracellular space in the nonionized form, thus reducing (to an even greater extent) the direct effect of THAM on the intracellular acid-base equilibrium.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Tromethamine is a weak base; following IV injection, it attracts and combines with hydrogen ions and their associated acid anions and the resulting salts are excreted in urine. Tromethamine can combine with lactic, pyruvic, and other metabolic acids and with carbonic acid. ... At pH 7.4, approximately 70% of the tromethamine present in plasma is in the ionized (protonated) form; if pH is decreased from pH 7.4, the ionized fraction of the drug is increased. In contrast to the ionized fraction of tromethamine, which upon administration reacts only with acid in the extracellular fluids, the fraction of the dose which remains un-ionized at physiologic pH is thought to be capable of penetrating the cell membrane to combine with intracellular acid. Since administration of tromethamine reduces hydrogen ion concentration, there is a decrease in proton donor and an increase in proton acceptor concentrations in body buffers. In the bicarbonate:carbonic acid buffer, the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide is decreased (at least until regulatory mechanisms compensate) and the concentration of bicarbonate is increased. The reduction of carbon dioxide tension removes a potent stimulus to breathing and may result in hypoventilation and hypoxia.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.2X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates that tromethamine is expected to exist in both the vapor and particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase tromethamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11hours. Particulate-phase tromethamine is removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Tromethamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, an estimated Koc value of 1 indicates that tromethamine is expected to possess very high mobility in soil. The pKa of tromethamine is 8.07. Thus, this compound will partially exist in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts. As a result, tromethamine may have greater adsorption and less mobility than its estimated Koc value indicates. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected since cations do not volatilize and the estimated Henry's Law constant for the neutral species (free base) of tromethamine is 8.7X10-13 atm cu m/mol. Tromethamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Tromethamine yielded no oxygen uptake when incubated with pure cultures of different strains of bacteria, indicating biodegradation may be slow in the environment. If released to water, tromethamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. However, based on the pKa of 8.07, it should exist partially as a cation under environmental conditions (pH 5-9). As a result, tromethamine may have greater adsorption to suspended to solids and sediment than its estimated Koc value indicates. Volatilization from water surfaces will not be an important fate process since cations do not volatilize and given the estimated Henry's Law constant for the neutral species. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to tromethamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tromethamine is produced or used. (SRC)",

As a result, tromethamine may have greater adsorption and less mobility than its estimated Koc value indicates since cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than neutral species(4). Volatilization of tromethamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) since cations do not volatilize and the estimated Henry's Law constant for the neutral species is 8.7X10-13 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(5).

As a result, tromethamine may have greater adsorption to suspended solids and sediment than its estimated Koc value indicates(SRC). Volatilization from water is not expected(4) since cations do not volatilize and the estimated Henry's Law constant for the neutral species (free base) of tromethamine is 8.7X10-13 atm cu m/mol(SRC), calculated using a fragment constant estimation method(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

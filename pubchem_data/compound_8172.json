Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

It has a very low order of acute toxicity by iv, ip, peroral, percutaneous and inhalation (vapor and aerosol) routes of exposure. It does not produce primary skin iritation. Acute eye contact with the liquid causes mild local transient irritation (conjunctival hyperemia and slight chemosis) but does not induce corneal injury. Animal maximization and human volunteer repeated insult patch tests studies have shown that TEG does not cause skin sensitization. A study with Swiss-Webster mice demonstrated that TEG aerosol has properties of a peripheral chemosensory irritant material and caused a depression of breathing rate with an RD(50) of 5140 mg/ cu m. Continuous subchronic peroral dosing of TEG in the diet of rats did not produce any systemic cumulative or long-term toxicity. The effects seen were dose-related increased relative kidney weight, increased urine volume and decreased urine pH, probably a result of the renal excretion of TEG and metabolites following the absorption of large doses of TEG. There was also decreased hemoglobin concentration, decreased hematocrit and increased mean corpuscular volume, probably due to hemodilution following absorption of TEG. The NOAEL was 20,000 ppm TEG in diet. Short-term repeated aerosol exposure studies in the rat demonstrated that, by nose-only exposure, the threshold for effects by respiratory tract exposure was 1036 mg/cu m. Neither high dosage acute nor repeated exposures to TEG produce hepatorenal injury characteristic of that caused by the lower glycol homologues. Elimination studies with acute peroral doses of TEG given to rats and rabbits showed high recoveries (91-98% over 5 days), with the major fraction appearing in urine (84-94%) and only 1% as carbon dioxide. TEG in urine is present in unchanged and oxidized forms, but only negligible amounts as oxalic acid. Developmental toxicity studies with undiluted TEG given by gavage produced maternal toxicity in rats (body weight, food consumption, water consumption, and relative kidney weight) with a NOEL of 1126 mg/kg/day, and mice (relative kidney weight) with a NOEL of 5630 mg/kg/day. Developmental toxicity, expressed as fetotoxicity, had a NOEL of 5630 mg/kg/day with the rat and 563 mg/kg/day with mice. Neither species showed any evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There was no evidence for reproductive toxicity with mice given up to 3% TEG in drinking water in a continuous breeding study. TEG did not produce mutagenic or clastogenic effects in the following in vitro genetic toxicology studies: Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test, SOS-chromotest in E. coli, CHO forward gene mutation test (HGPRT locus), CHO sister chromatid exchange test, and a chromosome aberration test with CHO cells. The use patterns suggest that exposure to TEG is mainly occupational, with limited exposures by consumers. Exposure is normally by skin and eye contact. Local and systemic adverse health effects by cutaneous exposure are likely not to occur, and eye contact will produce transient irritation without corneal injury. The very low vapor pressure of TEG makes it unlikely that significant vapor exposure will occur. Aerosol exposure is not a usual exposure mode, and acute aerosol exposures are unlikely to be harmful, although a peripheral sensory irritant effect may develop. However, repeated exposures to a TEG aerosol may result in respiratory tract irritation, with cough, shortness of breath and tightness of the chest. Recommended protective and precautionary measures include protective gloves, goggles or safety glasses and mechanical room ventilation. LC(50) data to various fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae, indicate that TEG is essentially nontoxic to aquatic organisms. Also, sustained exposure studies have demonstrated that TEG is of a low order of chronic aquatic toxicity. The bioconcentration potential, environmental hydrolysis, and photolysis rates are low, and soil mobility high. In the atmosphere TEG is degraded by reacting with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. These considerations indicate that the potential for ecotoxicological effects with TEG is low.",

Upon arrival to the emergency room, she was unconscious and had metabolic acidoses (pH 7.03, PCO2 44 mmHg, bicarbonate 11 mmol/L, anion gap 30 mmol/L, serum creatinine 90 umol/L). She was intubated and given 100 mmol of iv sodium bicarbonate. Triethylene glycol is thought to be metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acidic products resulting in metabolic acidosis. To act as a competitor of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, ethanol was administered to maintain a serum ethanol level of 100 mg/dL. The blood pH returned to normal over the next 8 hrs, and ethanol infusion was continued for 22 hr. At 36 hr post ingestion, the patient was discharged to a psychiatric ward. Analysis of blood drawn upon admission did not detect the presence of ethanol, ethylene glycol, methanol... . The above case study described the... brake fluid as 99.9% triethylene glycol.

It was part of a series of glycol ethers & congeners evaluated for structure-activity correlations using this design. Data collected on body weights, clinical signs, & food/water consumption during the dose-range-finding segment (Task 1) were used to set concns for the main study (Task 2) at 0.0, 0.3, 1.5%, & 3.0% in the drinking water. These concns gave calculated consumption estimates of 0.6, 3.3, & 6.8 g/kg/day. Two animals died in the control, middle dose group, & high dose group. TG consumption had no effect on the number of litters/pair delivered during Task 2, nor the number of live pups/litter. The mean live pup weight adjusted for litter size was reduced in the 1.5% & the 3.0% groups by 4% & 4.5%, respectively. The lack of change in the number of pups/litter or number of litters/pair led to the decision not to conduct Task 3 (the crossover mating to determine the affected sex). For the second generation, only the control & high dose groups were evaluated. For the wk before mating, when fluid consumption was measured, the treated mice consumed nearly equal to 16% more fluid than the controls. Nonetheless, there was no effect on the ability of the treated animals to mate or to deliver a litter of pups. Those litters had as many live pups as the controls, & the pups weighed the same (i.e., adjusted pup weight was not reduced by TG exposure). The F1 mice were killed & necropsied after the F2 pups were delivered & evaluated. Relative liver weight was increased by 5% & 6% in males & females, but there were no changes in body weight or other organ weights at necropsy in males or females. Epididymal sperm concn, motility, & morphology were unaffected by TG exposure at 3%. In summary, TG was not a reproductive toxicant in either generation of Swiss mice when administered in drinking water at concns of up to 3% /weight/volume/, although developmental toxicity was noted in the first generation as reduced pup body weight.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.32X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates triethylene glycol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase triethylene glycol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hours. Alcohols and ethers do not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore triethylene glycol is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, triethylene glycol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.2X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. River die-away test data demonstrate that biodegradation is likely to be the most important removal mechanism of triethylene glycol from aerobic soil and water; complete degradation in river die-away studies required 7-11 days. If released into water, triethylene glycol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to triethylene glycol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where triethylene glycol is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to triethylene glycol via inhalation of ambient air, and dermal contact with products containing triethylene glycol.

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

During choline administration, the plasma-free choline concentration increased into the normal range within 1 week in all four patients and remained at or above the normal range for all 6 weeks, but decreased back to baseline when choline supplementation was discontinued. Hepatic steatosis resolved completely, as estimated by abdominal computed tomography (CT). Liver density increased from -14.2 +/- 22.3 Hounsfield units (HU) to 8.4 +/- 10.3 HU at week 2 (P = .002); 9.6 +/- 10.7 HU at week 4 and 13.1 +/- 7.3 HU at week 6, as determined by the liver-spleen CT number difference obtained by the subtraction of the average spleen CT number (in HU) from the average liver CT number. This improvement continued up to 4 weeks after choline supplementation (13.8 +/- 2.8 HU). Hepatic steatosis was shown to have recurred in one patient after 10 weeks of return to choline-free parenteral nutrition. The hepatic steatosis associated with parenteral nutrition can be ameliorated, and possibly prevented, with choline supplementation. ...",

Furthermore, low choline status has been associated with both hepatic morphologic and hepatic aminotransferase abnormalities. A preliminary pilot study suggested choline-supplemented TPN may be useful in reversal of these hepatic abnormalities. ... : Fifteen patients (10 M, 5 F) who had required TPN for > or =80% of their nutritional needs were randomized to receive their usual TPN (n = 8), or TPN to which 2 g choline chloride had been added (n = 7) for 24 weeks. Baseline demographic data were similar between groups. Patients had CT scans of the liver and spleen, and blood for plasma free and phospholipid-bound choline, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin, serum lipids, complete blood count (CBC), and chemistry profile obtained at baseline, and weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 34. CT scans were analyzed for Hounsfield unit (HU) densities. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in any measured parameters after 2 weeks. However, at 4 weeks, a significant difference in liver HU between groups was observed (13.3+/-5.0 HU [choline] vs 5.8+/-5.2 HU [placebo], p = .04). This significant trend continued through week 24. Recurrent hepatic steatosis and decreased HU were observed at week 34, 10 weeks after choline supplementation had been discontinued. A significant increase in the liver-spleen differential HU was also observed in the choline group (10.6+/-6.2 HU [choline] vs 1.3+/-3.3 HU [placebo], p = .01). Serum ALT decreased significantly (p = .01 to .05) in the choline group vs placebo at weeks 6,12, 20, and 24. Serum AST was significantly decreased in the choline group by week 24 (p = .02). The serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly reduced in the choline group at weeks 2, 12, 20, 24, and 34 (p = .02 to 0.07). Total bilirubin was normal in these patients and remained unchanged during the study. Serum GGT tended to decrease more in the choline group, but the greater decrease was not statistically significant. ...  Choline deficiency is a significant contributor to the development of TPN-associated liver disease. The data suggest choline is a required nutrient for long-term home TPN patients.",

On consecutive days, 7, 14, 28, and 56 mmol choline chloride were intravenously infused over a 12-hour period in each subject. The choline concentration was determined in plasma at baseline, 1/4, 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours, and 3 and 12 hours after the infusion ended, and in daily 24-hour urine collections. Analysis of variance showed the data fit a two-compartment model in which elimination from the central compartment was saturable significantly better than a one-compartment model in all four subjects (p < 10-8 in all cases), and significantly better than a nonsaturating model in three of the four subjects (p = 1.0 x 10-9, 7.5 x 10-6, 9.4 x 10-11, respectively). The model allowed estimates of the rate constant for choline elimination at ambient levels, first-order rate constants for transfer between central and peripheral compartments, the dissociation constant for the saturable elimination process, the apparent volume of distribution in the central compartment, the steady-state volume of distribution, and the quantities of choline in the central compartment and in the readily exchangeable pool.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Prenatal choline supplementation caused significant increases in hippocampal NGF levels at 20 and 90 days of age, while levels of NGF in the frontal cortex were elevated in choline-supplemented rats at 20 days of age, but not 90 days of age. These results suggest that increases in NGF levels during development or adulthood may be one mechanism underlying improvements in spatial and temporal memory of adult rats exposed to elevated levels of choline chloride perinatally.",

(Pyrimidine metabolism in gerbils, but not rats, resembles that in humans.) Animals received, daily for 4 weeks, a diet containing choline chloride and UMP (a uridine source) and/or DHA by gavage. Brain phosphatidylcholine rose by 13-22% with uridine and choline alone, or DHA alone, or by 45% with the combination, phosphatidylethanolamine and the other phosphatides increasing by 39-74%. Smaller elevations occurred after 1-3 weeks. The combination also increased the vesicular protein Synapsin-1 by 41%, the postsynaptic protein PSD-95 by 38% and the neurite neurofibrillar proteins NF-70 and NF-M by up to 102% and 48%, respectively. However, it had no effect on the cytoskeletal protein beta-tubulin. Hence, the quantity of synaptic membrane probably increased. The precursors act by enhancing the substrate saturation of enzymes that initiate their incorporation into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and by UTP-mediated activation of P2Y receptors. Alzheimer's disease brains contain fewer and smaller synapses and reduced levels of synaptic proteins, membrane phosphatides, choline and DHA. The three phosphatide precursors might thus be useful in treating this disease.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

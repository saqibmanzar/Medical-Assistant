When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Dose, fasting, or antibiotic pretreatment had no effect on the absorption and metabolism of 1,3-DNB in this model system. The failure of antibiotic pretreatment to alter the metabolism of 1,3-DNA indicated that 1,3-DNB metabolism was mammalian rather than microfloral in origin. ...",

Subcellular fractions from duodenal, jejunal, and ileal regions of rat small intestinal mucosa were used to characterize the enzyme source(s) of those reductive reactions of 1,3-DNB that are relevant in the oxygenated intestinal tissue. 1,3-DNB was reduced to 3-nitroaniline (3-NA) by cytosol from duodenum and jejunum. The rate of reduction was 2 times faster when incubations contained duodenal rather than jejunal cytosol. Jejunal cytosol-catalyzed reduction of 1,3-DNB was supported by hypoxanthine, NADPH, or NADH. Duodenal microsomes catalyzed the reduction of 1,3-DNB to 3-NA in the presence of supplemental NADPH or NADH; however, the reaction was very slow. Jejunal microsomes, ileal microsomes, and ileal cytosol failed to catalyze the reduction of 1,3-DNB. Studies with chemical inhibitors suggested possible roles for DT diaphorase, glutathione reductase, or xanthine oxidase in the jejunal cytosol-catalyzed reaction. Purified, commercially available xanthine oxidase (from buttermilk) catalyzed the reduction of 1,3-DNB to 3-NA when supplemented with NADH or hypoxanthine.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Hemolytic anemia was observed in a dose-related fashion in both sexes. Inhibition of the body weight gain was observed in the highest dose groups for both sexes. On the histological examination there was an evidence of lipofuscin deposition mainly occurring in the proximal renal tubules in the male animals of the highest dose group. Hemosiderin deposition in the spleen and swelling of hepatocytes were observed on histological examination in all dose groups. Erythroid hyperplasia was observed on histological examination in all treated groups. LOAEL dose at which no toxic effects were observed was established as 15 mg/kg/day under the test conditions. EDLC estimated dose of low concern was calculated as 0.003 mg/kg/day. There were some effects on reproductive organs observed in the males of the highest dose group in the form of testicular atrophy. Histologically this dose group showed reduction of spermatogenesis with multinucleated giant cell formation.",

No remarkable histopathological change in the ovaries was observed in any of the non-pregnant females and in females which showed total litter loss after the parturition. The testicular and epididymal weights were comparable among all four groups. No compound related histopathological changes in these organs were found in any of the males.

Biotransformation products of anilines in the zebrafish were analyzed by HPLC. The aim of the investigations was to find relationships between accumulation/elimination/metabolism and toxicity on the one hand and between chemical structure and biotransformation on the other. ... A good correlation of log BCF and of log Pow with log LC50 /was found/. This concurs with the assumption that the internal dose determines the toxicological effect. All anilines investigated, with the exception of 2- and 4-nitroaniline, were transformed into the corresponding acetanilides. The toxicity of the compounds was not altered by biotransformation. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.56X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-nitroaniline will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-nitroaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 41 hours. Particulate-phase 3-nitroaniline will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 3-Nitroaniline does absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-nitroaniline is expected to have very high to high mobility based upon Koc values of 44 and 87. However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.9X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. A number of screening studies using soil, activated sludge and sewage have found 3-nitroaniline to be generally resistant to biodegradation. If released into water, 3-nitroaniline is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. In the water column, 3-nitroaniline may be susceptible to significant degradation in sunlight via reaction with photochemically produced oxidants such as hydroxyl and alkoxy radicals. BCF values of <10 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 3-nitroaniline may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-nitroaniline is produced or used.  (SRC)",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

No biodegradation of 3-nitroaniline (100 ppm) was observed in a 2-week period in the standard biodegradability test of the Japanese Ministry International Trade and Industry (MITI), a BOD test utilizing a mixed inoculum of activated sludge, sewage and surface water(3). No biodegradation of 3-nitroaniline was observed at concn of 25-30 ppm upon incubation with adapted activated sludge for 20 days(4). No degradation of 3-nitroaniline in a mineral salts solution, with a soil inoculum, occurred in 64 days(5). No biodegradation occurred over a 240 hr period in a respirometer study(6). Only limited biooxidation of 3-nitroaniline was observed in respirometric tests utilizing phenol-adapted bacteria(7). In a 60-day respirimeter test using sewage seed, no biodegradation of 3-nitroaniline (5 ppm) occured(8). However partial degradation was observed when the test solution was cross-seeded with microorganisms acclimated to 4-nitroaniline(8). Using the Zahn-Wellens test procedure, 3-nitroaniline was difficult to degrade as elimination was less than 20% over the 28 day incubation period(9). In another Zahn-Wellens test, no DOC removal occurred in 23 days of incubation(10). 3-Nitroaniline had a biodegradation rate of 0.026/h in river water giving a half-life of 27 hours, which was classified as poor degradation(11). A 5 day BOD at 20 \u00b0C in Songhua river water was 6% for 3-nitroaniline(12).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 41 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 3-Nitroaniline is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Aromatic amines react relatively rapidly in natural water with photochemically produced oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals and alkoxy radicals(3); half-lives of aniline are on the order of 30 hr of sunlight for hydroxyl radicals and 19 hr of sunlight for peroxy radicals(3); reactions with 3-nitroaniline are likely to be somewhat slower due to the presence of the nitro function(SRC). 3-Nitroaniline does absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

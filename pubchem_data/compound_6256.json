It is an active antiviral agent in ophthalmic solutions used mainly in the treatment of primary keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent epithelial keratitis due to herpes simplex virus. It displays effective antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2.   The combination product of trifluridine with tipiracil marketed as Lonsurf has been approved in Japan, the United States, and the European Union for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF biological therapy, and if RAS wild-type, an anti-EGFR therapy. In the anticancer therapy, trifluridine acts as a thymidine-based nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that gets incorporated into DNA of cancer cells following cell uptake to aberrate DNA function during cell replication.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Some strains of adenovirus that contribute to the pathology of keratoconjunctivitis were shown to be susceptible to trifluridine _in vitro_. While there is evidence from a study that cross-resistance may develop between trifluridine and [idoxuridine] or [vidarabine], trifluridine was shown to effective in treating dendritic ulcers in patients with herpetic keratitis who are unresponsive to [idoxuridine] or [vidarabine] based on the results from masked comparative trials. In nonclinical studies, trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride demonstrated antitumour activity against both 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of trifluridine and tipiracil against several human tumour xenografts show high correlation with the amount of trifluridine incorporated into DNA, indicating that the primary mechanism of action of trifluridine involves the direct incorporation into the cancer cell DNA. Trifluridine and tipiracil demonstrated anti-tumor activity against KRAS wild-type and mutant human colorectal cancer xenografts in mice.   In clinical studies comprised of patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer, treatment of trifluridine in combination with tipiracil in addition to best supportive care over a 5- or 7-month period resulted in increased progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) compared to placebo. In an open-label study, administration of trifluridine at the recommended dosage in patients with advanced solid tumors had no clinically relevant effect on QT/QTc prolongation compared with placebo. Two out of 48 patients displayed had QTc greater than 500 msec and 1 of 42 patients (2.4%) had a QTc increase from baseline greater than 60 msec.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Following a single dose of LONSURF (35 mg/m2) in patients with advanced solid tumors, the mean times to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) of trifluridine was around 2 hours. Trifluridine area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC0-last) was approximately 3-fold higher and maximum concentration (Cmax) was approximately 2-fold higher after multiple dose administration (twice daily for 5 days a week with 2 days rest for 2 weeks followed by a 14-day rest, repeated every 4 weeks) than after single-dose administration.  Following a single oral administration of LONSURF at 35 mg/m2 in patients with cancer, the mean time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) of trifluridine was around 2 hours. For the ophthalmic formulation, systemic absorption appears to be negligible. A standardized high-fat, high-calorie meal decreased trifluridine Cmax by approximately 40% but did not change trifluridine AUC compared to those in a fasting state in patients with cancer following administration of a single dose of LONSURF 35 mg/m2.  In a dose finding study (15 to 35 mg/m2 twice daily), the AUC from time 0 to 10 hours (AUC0-10) of trifluridine tended to increase more than expected based on the increase in dose.",

The synthesis and characterization of alpha-trifluoromethyl-beta-alanyl glycine (F3MBAG), a putative new metabolite of F3TdR, are now reported. This study describes ex vivo and in vivo detection of F3MBAG and other previously reported metabolites of trifluridine, using 19F NMR spectroscopy, in male BALB/C mice bearing EMT-6 tumors. A parallel 19F NMR spectroscopic study was also performed on rats dosed with F3TdR, to observe the qualitative pattern of F3TdR metabolism in another species. Unexpectedly, 5-trifluoromethyl-5,6-dihydroxyuracil (DOHF3T), alpha-trifluoromethyl-beta-ureidopropionic acid (F3MUPA) and fluoride, which result from the metabolic degradation of F3TdR and which were detected in various biological samples from mice dosed with F3TdR, could not be identified in rat urine or in homogenized tissue extracts. The presence of these metabolites in intact tissues is uncertain since in this study 19F NMR spectroscopy of these samples always displayed a broad resonance \"hump\" across the range of chemical shifts that would encompass these metabolites. No clear explanation for the loss of spectroscopic resolution in this region has been rationalized. N-Carboxy-alpha-trifluoromethyl-beta-alanine (F3MBA-CO2), alpha-trifluoromethyl-beta-alanyl alanine (F3MBAA) and N-acetyl-alpha-trifluoromethyl-beta-alanine (Ac-F3MBA) were synthesized and characterized, but were not detected as metabolites in any of the biological specimens examined.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Trifluridine gets incorporated into viral DNA during replication, which leads to the formation of defective proteins and an increased mutation rate. Trifluridine also mediates antineoplastic activities via this mechanism; following uptake into cancer cells, trifluridine is rapidly phosphorylated by thymidine kinase to its active monophosphate form. Subsequent phosphorylation produces trifluridine triphosphate, which is readily incorporated into the DNA of tumour cells in place of thymidine bases to perturb DNA function, DNA synthesis, and tumour cell proliferation. As trifluridine is subject to rapid degradation by TPase and readily metabolised by a first-pass effect following oral administration, tipiracil is added in the antineoplastic combination product as an inhibitor of TPase to increase the bioavailability of trifluridine. Trifluridine monophosphate also reversibly inhibits thymidylate synthetase (TS), an enzyme that is necessary for DNA synthesis and which levels are shown to be elevated different cancer cell lines. Up-regulation of the expression of the TS enzyme may also lead to the resistance to antineoplastic therapies, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). [A35289 However, this inhibitory effect is not considered to be sufficient enough to fully contribute to the cytotoxicity in cancer cells.",

The involved epithelium had a ground-glass appearance and exhibited opaque cells, edema, and spindle-shaped surface cells. Histopathology demonstrated severe cellular atypism, loss of cell polarity, dyskeratosis, parakeratosis, and a few mitotic figures. The pathological change was apparently intraepithelial. After scraping, the edema and opaque cells in the regenerated epithelium gradually disappeared in 3-4 months on cessation of trifluridine therapy. In one patient recurrence of dendritic keratitis, 5 weeks after scraping, was treated by topical bromovinyldeoxyuridine eye drops. Since severe epithelial dysplasia may represent a precancerous condition, prolonged use of trifluridine should be avoided.",

Phase-contrast microscopy and XTT (sodium [2,3-bis [2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl]-2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide, inner salt) colorimetric assay were performed after 24, 48, and 72 hours of incubation. When adjustments were made for time of incubation and concentration, trifluridine reduced cell viability significantly more than ganciclovir, idoxuridine, and cidofovir (p<0.001, three-way analysis of variance). There was significant time-and dose-dependent reduction of cell viability (p<0.001) with trifluridine and cidofovir. After a 72-hour incubation with ganciclovir or idoxuridine, cell viability was reduced as compared with 24- and 48-hour incubation (p<0.001); only the effects of the highest concentration tested (1.0 mg/mL) were significantly different from those of the lower concentrations (p<0.002). At a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL, trifluridine and cidofovir produced moderate to severe signs of cytotoxicity, whereas ganciclovir and idoxuridine displayed much less severe morphologic signs. /These/ results indicate that antiviral agents may have both time- and concentration-related toxic effects on stromal keratocytes.

Those given 10 mg/kg/day also had a significantly increased incidence of testicular atrophy as compared to vehicle control mice.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.5X10-13 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates trifluridine will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase trifluridine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Trifluridine absorbs UV light at wavelengths of 260 nm and, therefore, could be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, trifluridine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. The pKa of trifluridine is 7.95, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-17 atm-cu m/mole. Trifluridine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, trifluridine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to trifluridine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where trifluridine is produced or used. Exposure to trifluridine among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

The DNA strand-breaking potential of N-nitroso-2-hydroxymorpholine, a metabolite of N-nitrosodiethanolamine formed by alcohol dehydrogenase -mediated oxidation, was also almost quantitatively abolished. In contrast to these beta-hydroxylated nitrosamines, the effectiveness of N-nitrosodiethylamine remained unaffected by 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol with respect to its DNA damaging potential. ... A new activation mechanism for N-nitrosodiethanolamine is proposed: N-nitrosodiethanolamine is transformed at first by alcohol dehydrogenase into the cyclic hemiacetal N-nitroso-2-hydroxymorpholine. This cyclic beta-hydroxynitrosamine appears to be a substrate for sulfotransferase. The resulting sulfate conjugate is suggested to be ultimate genotoxic electrophile.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Nitrate was first removed from urine by an anion-exchange procedure that prevented the significant loss of various added reference NOC and unidentified urinary NOC. The total NOC were then determined by injecting the urine sample (nitrate content less than 1 mmol l-1) or anion-exchange eluate into refluxing ethyl acetate containing either acetic acid for determining heat and acetic acid labile thermal energy analyser responsive compounds (TAC) or into hydrogen bromide for the determination of TAC and NOC. The nitrogen monoxide levels released were measured using thermal energy analysis with chemiluminescence detection, and the differnce between the two determinations represented the concentrations of NOC. The optimum conditions for preventing artefactual nitrosation in urine samples by the addition of sodium hydroxide or sulphamic acid without decomposition of NOC were determined. The influence of time and storage conditions on NOC stability was investigated. Fifteen urine samples collected from volunteers dosed with proline were analysed for total NOC and N-nitrosamino acids revealing a preponderance of unknown NOC. The determination of total NOC in human urine using this group-selective method offers a new approach to the estimation of human exposure to NOC and to isolate hitherto unknown NOC and their metabolites. /N-nitroso cmpd/",

It is used as a gasoline and lubricant additive, antioxidant and as a stabilizer in plastics. HUMAN STUDIES: NDEA has been identified as tobacco carcinogen. Short-term exposure of a bronchial epithelial cell line to smoking-equivalent concentrations of tobacco carcinogens including NDEA altered the expression of key proliferation regulatory genes, EGFR, BCL-2, BCL2L1, BIRC5, TP53, and MKI67, similar to that reported in biopsy specimens of pulmonary epithelium described to be preneoplastic lesions. ANIMAL STUDIES: NDEA caused tumors in several species of experimental animals, at several different tissue sites, and by several different routes of exposure. It was carcinogenic in animals exposed perinatally and as adults, causing tumors mainly in the liver, respiratory tract, kidney, and upper digestive tract. Benign and malignant liver tumors occurred in mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, and pigs orally exposed to NDEA. Liver tumors also occurred in rats following inhalation exposure or rectal administration; in mice, rats, and hamsters following intraperitoneal injection; in hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, and hedgehogs following subcutaneous injection; in mice following prenatal exposure; in birds following intramuscular injection; and in fish and frogs exposed to NDEA in the tank water. In dogs, exposure to NDEA by stomach tube followed by subcutaneous injection caused cancer of the liver and nasal cavity. Tumors of the lung and upper respiratory tract occurred in mice, rats, hamsters, dogs, and pigs following oral administration of NDEA. Tumors of the kidney occurred in rats following oral, intravenous, or prenatal administration of NDEA. Oral administration also caused kidney tumors in pigs and tumors of the upper digestive tract in mice, rats, and hamsters. The mutagenicity of NDEA was evaluated in Salmonella tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538 (Ames Test), both in the presence and absence of added metabolic activation. NDEA did not cause a reproducible positive response in any of the bacterial tester strains, either with or without metabolic activation. In the presence of liver microsomal fraction from phenobarbital-treated rats, NDEA caused 8-azaguanine-resistant mutants in Chinese hamster V79 cells. NDEA was mutagenic in recessive lethal test in Drosophila melanogaster. The effects of NDEA on sexual development, gametogenesis, and oocyte maturation were studied in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). NDEA reduced the germ cell number dose-dependently during early stages of sexual differentiation in XX larvae, resulting in underdeveloped ovaries in adulthood at low doses. This effect was sex-specific as no such changes were seen in XY larvae. Furthermore, XX and XY larvae that were exposed at a low dose during early life showed a significant reduction in body weight in adulthood. Gonads in sexually immature adult medaka males and females exposed to NDEA were in advanced stages in comparison to that of the controls. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: NDEA induced oxidative stress and antioxidant defense to zebrafish metabolism system at concentrations over 5 ug/L. After a 42-day exposure, a significant DNA damage was observed in zebrafish liver cells at NDEA concentrations beyond 500 ug/L. Toxic and carcinogenic effects observed in snakes (Phython reticulatus) after lifelong administration of 6, 12, and 24 mg/kg NDEA by gavage at four nightly intervals. Total dose needed to induce tumors was 500-600 mg/kg.",

METHODS: The potentials of TCDD and DEN in separation or in combination to induce malignant transformation were tested in Balb/c 3T3 cells by using a cell transformation assay method. The possible mechanism of observed effects was studied further by adding a-naphthoflavone (a-NF), a competitive binding agent of TCDD, to the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. The mRNA expressions of Cyp1a1 and Cyp2a5 gene in Balb/c 3T3 cells treated by DEN and TCDD in separation or in combination with or without presence of a-NF were measured with fluorescence quantification RT-PCR technique.  RESULTS: The cell transformation frequency (TF) was significantly higher in case of induction with TCDD in combination with DEN, as compared to that with either TCDD or DEN alone. These effects were not inhibited via a-NF. The mRNA expression levels of both Cyp1a1 and Cyp2a5 were enhanced by TCDD treatment alone, but this inducible effect was blocked in cells treated by TCDD and DEN in combination.  CONCLUSION: TCDD and DEN had a significant synergistic effect on tumorigenesis when they were used in combination. AhR pathway may not be the key mechanism of this synergistic effect. Thus, it is necessary to further test the potential mechanism involved in cancer development.",

In the present study, we examined the effects of pitavastatin - a drug used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia - on the development of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver preneoplastic lesions in C57BL/KsJ-db/db (db/db) obese mice. Male db/db mice were administered tap water containing 40 ppm DEN for 2 weeks and were subsequently fed a diet containing 1 ppm or 10 ppm pitavastatin for 14 weeks. At sacrifice, feeding with 10 ppm pitavastatin significantly inhibited the development of hepatic premalignant lesions, foci of cellular alteration, as compared to that in the untreated group by inducing apoptosis, but inhibiting cell proliferation. Pitavastatin improved liver steatosis and activated the AMPK-alpha protein in the liver. It also decreased free fatty acid and aminotransferases levels, while increasing adiponectin levels in the serum. The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and the expression of TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 mRNAs in the liver were decreased by pitavastatin treatment, suggesting attenuation of the chronic inflammation induced by excess fat deposition.",

This study reports the effects of resveratrol in the early and advanced stages of hepatocarcinogenesis in a model of N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of male Wistar rats. For the experiment, rats were divided into different groups and treated with resveratrol either from day 1 of DEN administration for 15 days (pre-HCC), or after the development of HCC, i.e., 15-16 weeks after DEN administration (post-HCC), and compared to untreated HCC-bearing rats. Biochemical analysis of alpha-fetoprotein, the known serum marker for HCC, and other serum and liver marker enzymes also demonstrated a decreased level upon resveratrol treatment compared to the untreated HCC-bearing rats. H and E staining of tissue sections from the liver showed alteration or transformation of liver parenchymatous tissue in DEN-induced HCC (at 15-16 weeks). Resveratrol treatment during early (on day 1 of DEN-induction) and advanced (weeks 17-18) HCC showed a marked difference in the tissue architecture compared to untreated HCC. Immunoblot analysis revealed that resveratrol intervention at both the early and advanced stages of DEN-induced HCC activated the apoptotic markers, such as PARP cleavage, caspase-3 activation, p53 up-regulation and cytochrome-c release. In addition, semiquantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis demonstrated the up- and down-regulation of key apoptotic regulators, such as Bax and Bcl2, respectively, in a resveratrol treatment-dependent manner. ...",

HCC was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of NDEA (200 mg/kg) followed by subcutaneous injections of CCl(4) (3 mL/kg per week) for six weeks. After administration of the carcinogen, 200 and 400 mg/kg TPE were administered orally once a day throughout the study. The levels of liver cancer markers, including alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen, were substantially increased by NDEA treatment. TPE treatment significantly reduced liver injury and restored the entire liver cancer markers. Additionally, TPE markedly normalized the activity of antioxidant enzymes, namely lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase in the liver of NDEA-treated rats. Treatment with TPE significantly reduced the nodule incidence and multiplicity in the carcinogen-bearing rats. Histological observations of the liver tissues correlated with the biochemical observations. These findings powerfully support that T. purpurea prevented lipid peroxidation, suppressed the tumor burden, and promoted enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defence systems during NDEA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. This might have been due to modulating the antioxidant defense status, which contributed to its anticarcinogenic potential.",

Here, /researchers/ describe exposure of cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells to low concentrations of tobacco carcinogens: nickel sulphate, benzo(b)fluoranthene, N-nitrosodiethylamine, and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). After a 24 hr exposure, EGFR was expressed in cell membrane and cytoplasm, BCL-2 was expressed only in the irregular nuclei of large atypical cells, MKI67 was expressed in nuclei with no staining in larger cells, cytoplasmic BIRC5 with stronger nuclear staining was seen in large atypical cells, and nuclear TP53 was strongly expressed in all cells. After only a 24 hr exposure, cells exhibited atypical nuclear and cytoplasmic features. After a 48-hour exposure, EGFR staining was localized to the nucleus, BCL-2 was slightly decreased in intensity, BIRC5 was localized to the cytoplasm, and TP53 staining was increased in small and large cells. BCL2L1 was expressed in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of cells at 24 and 48 hr exposures. /Researchers/ illustrate that short-term exposure of a bronchial epithelial cell line to smoking-equivalent concentrations of tobacco carcinogens alters the expression of key proliferation regulatory genes, EGFR, BCL-2, BCL2L1, BIRC5, TP53, and MKI67, similar to that reported in biopsy specimens of pulmonary epithelium described to be preneoplastic lesions.",

Rats and hamsters were given a single ip dose of 0, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg NDEA/kg bw. After 24 hr, the rats and hamsters were killed and tissues were collected. Sections of nasal cavity and liver were evaluated histologically. All doses of NDEA caused inhibition of glycoprotein synthesis in cells of Bowman's glands in the olfactory region of rats and hamsters as determined by the loss of Alcian blue-periodic acid-Schiff staining material. Glycoprotein synthesis in other glands including the lateral nasal glands, maxillary glands, medial nasal glands, and the acinous glands near the vomeronasal organ was not affected by NDEA. Necrosis of Bowman's glands in the olfactory region of the nasal cavity occurred in rats given 20, 40, or 80 mg NDEA/kg bw whereas the same cells were not necrotic in hamsters given NDEA. The results demonstrate the unique susceptibility of cells of the Bowman's glands to the toxic effects of NDEA given ip and indicate that nasal tissues of the rat are more susceptible to the necrogenic effects of NDEA than those of the hamster.",

This increase led to a small accumulation of N1-acetylspermidine in the liver but produced a more striking effect on putrescine which increased 30- to 40-fold after 2 days. Most of this increase appeared to be due to the conversion of N1-acetylspermidine into putrescine which is catalyzed by polyamine oxidase. Treatment with the nitrosamines also increased the conversion of spermine into spermidine which replaced the spermidine converted into putrescine. Spermine levels were therefore significantly depressed by treatment with these carcinogens. These results indicate that these hepatocarcinogens bring about an increase in putrescine and in the spermidine/spermine ratio in the liver not only by enhancement of ornithine decarboxylase but also by induction of the spermidine N1-acetyltransferase activity which is the rate-limiting step in the acetylase-oxidase pathway for interconversion of the polyamines.",

The present study aims at investigating the role of N-nitrosamines in the alteration of homocysteine, lipid profile, oxidative stress, paraoxonase activity, antioxidant enzymes, and free radicals which are important risk factors for CVD. In addition, biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases such as creatine kinase MB activity (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as protein expression of both glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase p isozyme were assayed after treatment of rats with 0.2 mg/kg body weight of N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA), N-nitrosoethylbutylamine (NEBA), N-nitrosobutylpropylamine (NBPA), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPA) as a daily dose for two weeks. LDL levels, paraoxonase activity, reduced glutathione levels, and glutathione reductase activities were increased, whereas HDL levels decreased after treatment of rats with most of N-nitrosamines compared to control group. Moreover, levels of free radicals and catalase activity increased, whereas protein expression of both glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase decreased after treatment of rats with some N-nitrosamines. The data showed that most N-nitrosamines increased CK-MB and LDH activities. It is concluded that N-nitrosamines increased levels of free radicals, and decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes which may consequently increase the incidence of CVDs.",

Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and non-FAD riboflavin were determined fluorimetrically. Results revealed significant depletion in hepatic levels of these compounds at the end of 60 days, a period of exposure considered adequate for the development of hepatoma. Considerable reduction was also noticed after 15 days, and also when lower dose of NDEA was administered (50 mg/L). The flavin compounds in liver after short exposure to NDEA remained at depleted levels even after withdrawal of the carcinogen. Changes in the kidney were found to be less significant. The selective depletion of flavin compounds in the target tissue following NDEA exposure is of significance, and may be related to biochemical mechanisms involved in malignant transformation.",

Its potential toxicological effects have received extensive attention but remain to be poorly understood. In this study, changes in NDEA precursors in drinking water treatment process were studied using the trial of its formation potential (FP), and the toxicity induced by NDEA to adult zebrafish was investigated. NDEA FP in the raw water of Taihu Lake ranged from 46.9 to 68.3 ng/L. The NDEA precursors were removed effectively by O3/BAC process. Hydrophilic fraction and low-molecular-weight fraction (<1 kDa) had the highest NDEA FP. The toxicity results demonstrated that the acute lethal concentration of NDEA causing 50% mortality in 96 hr (96-hr LC50) was 210.4 mg/L, and NDEA was more likely to be accumulated in kidney, followed by liver and gill. NDEA induced oxidative stress and antioxidant defense to zebrafish metabolism system at concentrations over 5 ug/L. After a 42-day exposure, a significant DNA damage was observed in zebrafish liver cells at NDEA concentrations beyond 500 ug/L. This study investigated NDEA properties in both engineering prospective and toxicity evaluation, thus providing comprehensive information on its control in drinking water treatment process and its toxicity effect on zebrafish as a model animal.",

The developmental toxicity of DEN has been rarely reported as yet. In this study, zebrafish were exposed to different concentrations of DEN at 6 hr post-fertilization (hpf) to access embryonic toxicity of the compound. The results show that DEN resulted in negative effects of hatching rate, heartbeat, body length, and spontaneous movement. Deformities, including notochord malformation, pericardium edema, embryonic membrane turbidity, tail hypoplasia, yolk sac deformity, and growth retardation, happened during exposure period. Moreover, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) significantly increased after DEN treatment. Then, alterations of the expression level of oxidative stress-related genes were observed... Development toxicity of DEN should be related to the excessive oxidative stress.",

However, N-nitrosamines are produced by the reaction of amines, principally secondary amines with nitrosating agents and N-nitrosodiethylamine can be released into the environment from some industrial sources, principally the rubber, dyes, and metal industries. N-Nitrosodiethylamine occurs in tobacco smoke condensates and has been detected in mainstream and side stream tobacco smoke. It can also occur in cheese, meat, fish and other food products. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.86 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates N-nitrosodiethylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase N-nitrosodiethylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 22 hours. N-Nitrosodiethylamine absorbs UV light strongly above 290 nm with an absorption max at 330 nm which indicates a susceptibility for direct photolysis in sunlight. If released to soil, N-nitrosodiethylamine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 80. N-Nitrosodiethylamine rapidly volatilizes when applied to the soil surface (30 to 80% in a few hours) and slower when incorporated into soil (11% in 2 days). N-Nitrosodiethylamine is expected to photolyze on the soil surface exposed to sunlight. N-Nitrosodiethylamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 14C-N-Nitrosodiethylamine mineralized approximately 50% and volatilized 11% from Matapeake loam soil incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 20 days. If released into water, N-nitrosodiethylamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The concentration of N-nitrosodiethylamine in lake water was essentially unchanged after 108 days incubation in the dark at 30 \u00b0C, indicating that hydrolysis and biodegradation are not expected. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant of 3.63X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 and 80 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Direct photolysis in water is expected based on a half-life of 15 minutes for N-nitrosodiethylamine in aqueous solution exposed to irradiation representing Southern California midsummer, midday sun. When exposed to sunlight for 7 hours at 33-35 \u00b0C, the photolysis of a N-nitrosodiethylamine solution was 88.7% complete. Occupational exposure to N-nitrosodiethylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N-nitrosodiethylamine is produced, used or formed as a by-product. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to N-nitrosodiethylamine via inhalation of cigarette smoke and via ingestion of foods such as cheese, bacon, fish, beer and drinking water.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.63X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 and 80 days, respectively(SRC). The concentration of N-nitrosodiethylamine (18.0 ppm nitroso-N) in lake water was essentially unchanged after 108 days incubation in the dark at 30 \u00b0C(5), indicating that hydrolysis and biodegradation are not expected(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 0.48(7) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Direct photolysis in water is expected based on a rate constant of 0.045/min with a half-life of 15 minutes for N-nitrosodiethylamine in aqueous solution exposed to irradiation representing Southern California midsummer, midday sun(8). When exposed to sunlight for 7 hours at 33-35 \u00b0C, the photolysis of a N-nitrosodiethylamine solution was 88.7% complete(9).",

Vapor-phase N-nitrosodiethylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 22 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.8X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). N-Nitrosodiethylamine absorbs UV light strongly above 290 nm with an absorption max at 330 nm and a quantum yield of 0.43(4) which indicates a susceptibility for direct photolysis in sunlight(SRC).

While the level of N-nitrosodiethylamine amended with raw sewage at pH 6.0 slowly decreased from approximately 17 ppm to 12 ppm over 14 days; the fact that the decrease was nearly the same in sterilized samples indicates that abiotic factors may have been responsible for the loss. At pH 7.2 the rate of loss was greater than for autoclaved sewage, however heat treatment may have altered sample properties so that nonbiological loss was diminished(1). After a lag period, 14C-N-nitrosodiethylamine was mineralized approximately 50% from Matapeake loam soil (38.4% sand, 49.4% silt, 12.2% clay, 1.5% organic matter, pH 5.5) at 30 \u00b0C in 20 days(2).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 22 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). N-Nitrosodiethylamine absorbs UV light strongly above 290 nm with an absorption max at 330 nm and a quantum yield of 0.43(2) which indicates a susceptibility for direct photolysis in sunlight(SRC). The estimated atmospheric residence time for N-nitrosodiethylamine is <0.3 days with photolysis probably a primary removal mechanism(3). The half-life for N-nitrosodiethylamine is about 1-2 hours in a Teflon outdoor smog chamber irradiated with sunlight(4). The direct photolysis rate constant for N-nitrosodiethylamine in aqueous solution exposed to irradiation representing Southern California midsummer, midday sun was observed to be 0.045/min with a half-life of 15 minutes(2). When exposed to sunlight for 7 hours at 33-35 \u00b0C, the photolysis of a N-nitrosodiethylamine solution was 88.7% complete(5). While the level of N-nitrosodiethylamine amended with raw sewage at pH 6.0 slowly decreased from approximately 17 ppm to 12 ppm over 14 days, the fact that the decrease was nearly the same in sterilized samples indicates that abiotic factors may have been responsible for the loss(6). The concentration of N-nitrosodiethylamine was essentially unchanged after 108 days incubation in water at 30 \u00b0C in the dark, this suggests that hydrolysis is not likely(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that N-nitrosodiethylamine is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 10 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 80 days(SRC). N-Nitrosodiethylamine's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). N-Nitrosodiethylamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.86 mm Hg(3). The volatilization of N-nitrosodiethylamine incorporated 7.5 cm in Matapeake loam soil (water at field capacity, 26%) was studied at 20 \u00b0C and at 35 \u00b0C days/20 \u00b0C nights(4). N-Nitrosodiethylamine was applied at a rate corresponding to 6 g/ha. At 20 \u00b0C, about 11% of the N-nitrosodiethylamine volatilized, most of it within the first 2 days. At the higher temperature, almost 21% of the N-nitrosodiethylamine volatilized, most of it within the first 2 days. When surface applied, 30-80% of the application may be lost during the first few hours(4).",

In a preliminary survey of the Italian market, the concentrations of N-nitrosodiethylamine in canned luncheon meats and cured meats were <0.3-62.80 and <0.3-11.01 ppb, respectively(2). The food item with the highest concentration was pork with jelly(2). No N-nitrosodiethylamine was detected in 38 samples of cooking oils, 10 of butter, and 14 of margarine purchased in 1974 from retail stores in Ottawa, Canada(3). Cured meat stored in elastic rubber netting may pick up N-nitrosodiethylamine as a result of the interaction of the amine precursors (e.g., dithiocarbamates) in the rubber and nitrite additive commonly used in the preparation of the cured meat(4). For example, a smoked ham stored in rubber netting contained 6.9 ppb of N-nitrosodiethylamine in the outer layer, 4.9 ppb in the next layer and 0.8 ppb in the center(4). A N-nitrosodiethylamine concentration of 3 ppb was found in beer(5). When rubber nipples were sterilized in a manner typical of home use, N-nitrosodiethylamine in the rubber nipples migrated into water, milk, and infant formula(6).",

Before the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission established an action level of 60 ppb total volatile N-nitrosamines in latex infant pacifiers on Jan 1, 1984, levels of N-nitrosodiethylamine in these products ranged from 1.5-3.7 ppb(3). In a baseline study performed at the time the action level was issued, N-nitrosodiethylamine was found in infant pacifiers sold in the U.S. by 6 of 15 manufacturers(2). N-Nitrosodiethylamine levels in pacifiers by these 6 manufacturers ranged up to 7.16 ppb(2). Pacifier samples from 10 manufacturers who were manufacturing or importing pacifiers after January 1, 1984 contained no detectable N-nitrosodiethylamine. In an FDA study, N-nitrosodiethylamine was found in 2 of six lots of baby bottle rubber nipples, both at 12.7 ppb(3). A voluntary standard provides that current rubber pacifiers shall not contain more than 10 ppb of any single nitrosamine or more than 20 ppb of total nitrosamine(4).",

N-Nitrosodiethylamine was detected in 11 samples, the detection limit being 0.1 microgram/litre. No other volatile nitrosamines were detected. After a test meal of bacon, spinach, bread and beer, the concentration of N-nitrosodimethylamine increased. There was no appreciable difference between the nitrosamine concentrations in the blood of laboratory workers and in the blood of other people. Salivary nitrite concentrations measured semi-quantitatively concurrently with blood sampling varied considerably but showed no apparent correlation with blood nitrosamine levels. Measurements in rabbits given a continuous infusion of N-nitrosodimethylamine gave a clearance rate approximately equal to the blood flow through the liver and a volume of distribution of 1.2 litre/kg body weight. By applying these results to man, the body burden after the meal was calculated as 40-50 microgram. This is substantially higher than the estimated weekly intake of volatile nitrosamines from food.",

It is a phenothiazine antipsychotic used principally in the treatment of nausea; vomiting; and vertigo. It is more likely than chlorpromazine to cause extrapyramidal disorders. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p612) The mechanism of action of prochlorperazine has not been fully determined, but may be primarily related to its antidopaminergic effects. Prochlorperazine blocks the D2 somatodendritic autoreceptor, resulting in the blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic system and an increased dopamine turnover. Prochlorperazine also has anti-emetic effects, which can be attributed to dopamine blockade in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Prochlorperazine also blocks anticholinergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors, the blockade of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors resulting in sedation, muscle relaxation, and hypotension.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10 week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (eg, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Prochlorperazine maleate is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.",

It also exerts its anti-emetic actions via anti-dopaminergic effects, where it displays similar efficacy as ondansteron, a 5HT-3 receptor antagonist and anti-emetic, in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting. Prochlorperazine was shown to inhibit histaminergic, cholinergic and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. The blockade of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors may result in sedation, muscle relaxation, and hypotension. It displays anti-anxiety effects as well. Compared to other phenothiazine derivatives, prochlorperazine is less sedating and has a weak propensity for causing hypotension or potentiating the effects of CNS depressants and anesthetics. Other than its primary action on D2 receptors, one study showed that prochlorperazine may inhibit the P2X7 receptor in human macrophages, leading to inhibition of calcium ion influx.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Prochlorperazine blocks the D2 dopamine receptors in the brain, which are somatodendritic autoreceptors. Inhibition of D2 receptor signaling results in the blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic system and an increased dopamine turnover. Nausea and vomiting are proposed to arise from peripheral or central stimulation of  serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) and dopamine type 2 receptors, the predominant receptors expressed at the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). Prochlorperazine exerts antiemetic effects and was shown to inhibit apomorphine-induced vomiting by blocking D2 dopamine receptors in the CTZ..",

The pharmacology of phenothiazines is complex, and because of their actions on the central and autonomic nervous systems, the drugs affect many different sites in the body. Although the actions of the various phenothiazines are generally similar, these drugs differ both quantitatively and qualitatively in the extent to which they produce specific pharmacologic effects. /Phenothiazine General Statement/",

Phenothiazines generally do not produce substantial cortical depression; however, there is minimal information on the specific effects of phenothiazines at the cortical level. Phenothiazines also act in the basal ganglia, exhibiting extrapyramidal effects. The precise mechanism(s) of action, including antipsychotic action, of phenothiazines has not been determined, but may be principally related to antidopaminergic effects of the drugs. There is evidence to indicate that phenothiazines antagonize dopamine-mediated neurotransmission at the synapses. There is also some evidence that phenothiazines may block postsynaptic dopamine receptor sites. However, it has not been determined whether the antipsychotic effect of the drugs is causally related to their antidopaminergic effects. Phenothiazines also have peripheral and/or central antagonistic activity against alpha-adrenergic, serotonergic, histaminic (H1-receptors), and muscarinic receptors. Phenothiazines also have some adrenergic activity, since they block the reuptake of monoamines at the presynaptic neuronal membrane, which tends to enhance neurotransmission. The effects of phenothiazines on the autonomic nervous system are complex and unpredictable because the drugs exhibit varying degrees of alpha-adrenergic blocking, muscarinic blocking, and adrenergic activity. The antipsychotic activity of phenothiazines may be related to any or all of these effects, but it has been suggested that the drugs' effects on dopamine are probably most important. It has also been suggested that effects of phenothiazines on other amines (eg, gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) or peptides (eg, substance P, endorphins) may contribute to their antipsychotic effect. Further study is needed to determine the role of central neuronal receptor antagonism and of effects on biochemical mediators in the antipsychotic action of the phenothiazines and other antipsychotic agents. /Phenothiazine General Statement/",

Prochlorperazine also has anti-emetic effects, which can be attributed to dopamine blockade in the chemoreceptor trigger zone.

Aminotransferase elevations can occur during therapy, but they are usually mild, asymptomatic and transient and reversible even with continuation of medication. Rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury have been reported due to prochlorperazine which resemble the cholestatic liver injury associated with chlorpromazine. The onset of jaundice is usually within 1 to 4 weeks, and the pattern of serum enzyme elevations is typically cholestatic or mixed. Immunoallergic features (fever and eosinophilia) occur in some cases, but they are usually mild and self-limited; autoantibodies are rare. Liver biopsy typically shows a cholestatic hepatitis. Importantly, prochlorperazine jaundice can be prolonged and has been associated with rare cases of vanishing bile duct syndrome (Case 1) that can be fatal or ultimately require liver transplantation.",

Treatment may include correction of electrolyte abnormalities and acid-base balance, lidocaine, phenytoin, isoproterenol, ventricular pacing, and defibrillation.  Antiarrhythmic agents that can prolong the QT interval (eg, class IA [disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine] or III agents) should be avoided in treating overdosage-associated arrhythmias in which prolongation of QTc is a manifestation. Appropriate therapy (IV fluids and a vasopressor) should be instituted if hypotension occurs; epinephrine, bretylium, or dopamine should not be used. For the management of refractory hypotension, vasopressors such as phenylephrine, levarterenol, or metaraminol may be used. Appropriate therapy should be instituted if excessive sedation occurs; CNS stimulants that may cause seizures should be avoided. If seizures occur, treatment should not include barbiturates because these drugs may potentiate phenothiazine-induced respiratory depression. Hypothermia is common and sometimes difficult to control. In some patients with acute toxicity, exchange transfusions may be useful, but hemodialysis, forced diuresis, hemoperfusion, or manipulation of urine pH is of little value in enhancing elimination of phenothiazines. /Phenothiazine General Statement/",

Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10 week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (eg, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Prochlorperazine maleate is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis",

Calmodulin antagonists (W-5, W-7, W-12, and W-13) showed similar effects as phenothiazines at concentrations of 10(-5)-10(-14) mol/L. These reactions were partially reversible at a concentration of 10(-9) mol/L. Cells cultured for 3 days in the presence of 10(-5) mol/L chlorpromazine or 10(-5) mol/L W-7 demonstrated morphologic alterations in their microvilli which were similar to those seen after cytochalasin B treatment, ie, thinning and elongation of the microvilli with honeycomb-like changes.",

Vehicle control groups and a positive control group (vitamin A 40,000 IU/kg/day) were similarly prepared. Observations of reproductive performance were made and the offspring examined in a battery of neurobehavioral tests. Fenfluramine and prochlorperazine produced abnormalities in both the reproductive measures and neurobehavioral testing. Propoxyphene produced developmental delays and other signs of \"pure\" behavioral teratogenesis in that these effects were not anticipated in any of the observations of reproductive performance. Diazepam appeared to have the mildest effect on all the measurements taken.",

The purpose of this study was to characterize the neurotoxic effect of three commonly used antiemetic agents (promethazine, dimenhydrinate, and prochlorperazine) as compared to saline in the rat sciatic nerve model. Intrafascicular and extrafascicular injection as well as direct application of the antiemetic drugs were performed. Nerves were harvested at 2 weeks postoperatively for histology and morphometry, with an additional sacrifice point at 8 weeks for the intrafascicular injection group. Injection injuries caused by antiemetic drugs differed depending on the agent injected and the location of injection. Extrafascicular injection and direct application caused no damage. Intrafascicular injection caused diffuse axonal injury in the promethazine and dimenhydrinate groups, while prochlorperazine caused only focal injury. Regeneration was prominent at 8 weeks in all intrafascicular injection groups in this rat model. Prochlorperazine thus appears to be less neurotoxic when injected intraneurally and should preferentially be used for intramuscular injections.",

Worldwide studies of common over-the-counter pharmaceuticals have reported detectable levels in the aquatic environment, but there are few studies examining impacts on marine habitats. These drugs can affect the functions of various vertebrates and invertebrates. The stability of two pharmaceuticals, cyclizine (CYC) and prochlorperazine (PCZ), in seawater was examined under light and dark conditions, as well as the toxicity of these compounds to larvae of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite, which is a cosmopolitan marine organism found in most of the world's oceans. CYC was very stable under all the tested conditions. On the other hand, PCZ degraded in light but not in the dark, and was more stable in seawater than fresh water. For the barnacle larvae, the LC50 of prochlorperazine was 0.93 microg/mL and the LC50 for CYC was approximately 0.04 microg/mL.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

After 12 weeks of ad libitum feeding the animals were then given control diet. Based on survival, body, liver,and kidney weights, and the histopathological evaluation of the kidneys, castrated female rats given testosterone propionate were afforded the greatest protective effect against the nephrotoxicity of 2-AAQ.",

A control group received no treatment. The study examined the influence of testosterone on the known nephrotoxicity of the test substance. Therefore groups of castrated animals (male and female) and female animals treated with testosterone were included in the study. Female animals in the test group (normal and castrated) died within 30 weeks while male animals and testosterone treated females survived 80 weeks. Histopathology revealed crystallization in cortical kidney tubules in normal and castrated females which was not seen in male animals or those females treated with testosterone. It was concluded from these results that testosterone offers a protective effect from the toxicity of the test substance that gender alone cannot explain. /Translated from German/",

A control group received no treatment. Equivalent dosage /over duration of the study/ at 1%: 22 g for males and 11.6 g for females, at 2%: 47 g for males and 18 g for females. After 10 weeks the dosage was reduced 0.25-0.5%. The 2% dose was determined in a preliminary experiment. Female animals in both groups experienced weight loss, alopecia, emaciation, ataxia, and preagonal convulsions. All female animals in both test groups died within 18 (2% group) and 21 (2% group) weeks. Hematological symptoms seen in female animals included a reduction in hematocrit, hemoglobin, and RBC. In both sexes there was an increase in blood glucose levels and serum calcium concentration as well as a large increase in serum urea concentration in female animals. Histopathological findings seen in female animals were primarily kidney damage as interstitial fibrosis and multitudinous tubular metaplasia as well as bone marrow hyperplasia. What was most striking was the minimal toxic effect found in male animals. /Translated from German/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.0X10-11 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-aminoanthraquinone will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase 2-aminoanthraquinone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2-Aminoanthraquinone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-aminoanthraquinone is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4,300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.2X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 1% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 2-aminoanthraquinone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A measured BCF range of 18-46 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-aminoanthraquinone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-aminoanthraquinone is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

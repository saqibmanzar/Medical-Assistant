PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Explosive limits specify the concentration range of a material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an ignition source. There are two types of explosive limits: lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL). The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

To extinguish the fire while allowing continued flow of the gas is extremely dangerous; an explosive cloud of gas/air mixture may be created that, if ignited, may cause far more damage than the original fire. Extinguishing the flame using carbon dioxide or dry chemical may be desirable to allow immediate access to valves to shut off the flow of gas, but this must be done carefully. In many cases, it will be preferable to allow continued burning, while protecting exposures with water spray, until the flow of gas can be stopped.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Morphological changes in the kidneys were observed 1.5 hr after giving 100 umol/kg of CTFG (i.v.), and severe damage to the proximal tubules was evident 24 hr after treatment; this dose of CTFG caused a 100-fold increase in urine glucose excretion, a 10-fold increase in urine protein excretion and a 4-fold increase in blood urea nitrogen concentrations 24 hr after administration. Administration of 50 umol/kg of CTFG or 100 umol/kg of CTFC produced similar lesions and increases in urine glucose excretion rates and blood urea nitrogen concentrations. Administration of 10 umol/kg of CTFG produced no discernable effect on the kidneys. CTFG and CTFC did not alter plasma glucose concentrations or plasma glutamate-pyruvate transaminase activities. CTFG and CTFC produced time- and dose-dependent loses of cell viability in isolated rat renal tubular cells. The toxicity of CTFG to isolated renal tubular cells was prevented by the gamma-glutamyltransferase inhibitor AT-125, and the toxicity of CTFC and CTFG to isolated cells was prevented by aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes. Moreover, S-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)-DL-alpha-methylcysteine, which cannot be metabolized by pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes, was not toxic to isolated renal tubular cells. The data presented support the hypothesis that the nephrotoxicity of chlorotrifluoroethene is due to the enzymatic formation of a glutathione conjugate, which is metabolized to the ultimate nephrotoxin by the sequential action of renal gamma-glutamyltransferase, cysteinylglycine dipeptidase and cysteine conjugate beta-lyase.",

Hepatic cytochrome P450 1A1 and principally P450 2B1/2 were induced by beta-naphthoflavone and phenobarbital, respectively. Nephrotoxicity was evaluated by investigating urine biochemical parameters, kidney histochemistry and histopathological modifications. ... CTFE ... induces severe nephrotoxicity in rats after 4 hr of exposure to 200 ... ppm ... . Compared with controls, activity levels of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma GT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) in 24-hr urine were increased similarly, but urinary excretion of glucose, proteins and beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m) and serum urea and creatinine levels were increased.  Histopathological and histochemical examinations of kidney sections of CTFE- ...-exposed rats revealed cellular necrosis and tubular lesions 24 hr after exposure. Beta-naphthoflavone-pretreated rats were afforded some protection against the nephrotoxicity of CTFE ... . Phenobarbital ... afforded some protection against CTFE nephrotoxicity. ...

Within 1 day after the first exposure, rats exhibited diuresis, increased water intake, decreased urine osmolality, increased urinary lactic dehydrogenase activity and increased plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen. When animals were exposed repeatedly, values for these parameters declined or returned to control levels during the exposure sequence in a manner comparable to rats receiving the single exposure. By the third day post exposure, coagulative necrosis involving primarily the pars recta, but extending to the pars convoluta, of the proximal tubule was present. Regeneration was apparent by the third day of exposure, and additional necrosis was minimal despite further exposures. Daily levels of urinary inorganic fluoride, an index of chlorotrifluoroethylene metabolism, were increased to 3-6 umol/24 hr/rat during the exposure sequence which coincided with a brief elevation in serum fluoride at the end of each exposure. Adaptation to chlorotrifluoroethylene is evident either through changes in the metabolism or disposition of chlorotrifluoroethylene or from a refractive property of the regenerating tissue to chlorotrifluoroethylene.",

The transformation of trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC-113) forms chlorotrifluoroethylene via reductive dechlorination. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.59X10+3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chlorotrifluoroethylene will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase chlorotrifluoroethylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.5 days. Chlorotrifluoroethylene is also expected to react with both atomic oxygen and ozone; an estimated half-life of 715 years is calculated for the reaction with ozone. Chlorotrifluoroethylene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, chlorotrifluoroethylene is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 95. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.31 atm-cu m/mole. Chlorotrifluoroethylene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, chlorotrifluoroethylene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 6 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to chlorotrifluoroethylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chlorotrifluoroethylene is produced or used. (SRC)",

Gas-phase chlorotrifluoroethylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.5 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.0X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of chlorotrifluoroethylene with ozone has been estimated as 0.002X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(4). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 720 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(5). The chlorine-atom initiated oxidation of chlorotrifluoroethylene in the atmosphere gives CClF2CF(O) as the major product; the quantum yield of oxidation for this reaction is >1000 relative to the quantum yield for olefin(6). A rate constant of 2.7X10-11 cm cu/mol sec is reported for the reaction of chlorotrifluoroethylene with atomic oxygen(7). Chlorotrifluoroethylene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(8), and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The quantum yield of oxidation for this reaction is >1000 relative to the quantum yield for olefin(2). The ozonolysis of chlorotrifluoroethylene proceeds through chain oxidation, carried by a diradical mechanism which is inhibited in the presence of O2. The major product of the reaction is the corresponding carbonyl product(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of chlorotrifluoroethylene with ozone has been estimated as 0.002X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 720 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(4). The primary product of this reaction is the corresponding carbonyl product(1). In the reaction of atomic oxygen with chlorotrifluoroethylene, CF2O and CFClO were reported as products with CF2O the more important; CFClO may have been a contaminant(1). A rate constant of 2.7X10-11 cm cu/mol sec is reported for the reaction of chlorotrifluoroethylene with atomic oxygen using flash photolysis and kinetic spectroscopy(5). Chlorotrifluoroethylene has a measured half-life of approximately 42 days in landfill leachate. It degrades in less than a day in sulfide-containing buffer(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

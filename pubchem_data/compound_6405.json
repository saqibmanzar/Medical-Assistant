ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Free and glucuronidated 2-methyl-2,3-butanediol and a glucuronide of tert-amyl alcohol were identified ...  as major urinary metabolites on the basis of the relative intensities of the (13)C NMR signals. The presence of several minor metabolites was also indicated by (13)C NMR; they were identified as tert-amyl alcohol, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyric acid, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid. One human volunteer was exposed to an initial concentration of 27,000 ppm [(13)C]TAME by inhalation for 4 min from a 2 L gas sampling bag, and metabolites of TAME excreted in urine were analyzed by (13)C NMR. All TAME metabolites identified in rats were also present in the human urine samples. To study tert-amyl alcohol biotransformation, male rats (n = 3) were treated with 250 mg/kg [(13)C]-tert-amyl alcohol dissolved in corn oil by gavage, and urine was collected for 48 hr. (13)C NMR of the urine samples showed the presence of metabolites identical to those in the urine of [(13)C]TAME-treated rats. Our results suggest that TAME is extensively metabolized by rats and humans to tert-amyl alcohol which may be further oxidized to diols and carboxylic acids. These reactions are likely mediated by cytochrome P450-dependent oxidations.",

The objective of this study was to use a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to describe the disposition of tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) and its major metabolite, tert-amyl alcohol (TAA), in male Fischer-344 rats. The model compartments for TAME and TAA were flow-limited. The TAME physiological model had 6 compartments: lung, liver, rapidly perfused tissues, slowly perfused tissues, fat, and kidney. The TAA model had 3 compartments: lung, liver, and total-body water. The 2 models were linked through metabolism of TAME to TAA in the liver. Model simulations were compared with data on blood concentrations of TAME and TAA taken from male Fischer-344 rats during and after a 6-hour inhalation exposure to 2500, 500, or 100 ppm TAME. The PBPK model predicted TAME pharmacokinetics when 2 saturable pathways for TAME oxidation were included. The TAA model, which included pathways for oxidation and glucuronide conjugation of TAA, underpredicted the experimental data collected at later times postexposure. To account for biological processes occurring during this time, three hypotheses were developed: nonspecific binding of TAA, diffusion-limited transport of TAA, and enterohepatic circulation of TAA glucuronide. These hypotheses were tested using three different model structures. Visual inspection and statistical evaluation involving maximum likelihood techniques indicated that the model incorporating nonspecific binding of TAA provided the best fit to the data. ...",

The groundwater contained elevated concentrations of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), TBA (tert-butyl alcohol), TBF (tert-butyl formate), BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene isomers), and other gasoline additives (tert-amyl methyl ether, di-isopropyl ether, tert-amyl alcohol, methanol, and acetone). The bioreactor was a gravity-flow membrane-based system called a Biomass Concentrator Reactor (BCR) designed to retain all biomass within the reactor. It was operated for six months at an influent flow rate that ultimately reached 5 gpm. The goal was to achieve a removal of all contaminants to <5 ug/L, which is the California Drinking Water advisory for MTBE. The concentration of TBA, an MTBE biodegradation byproduct, was consistently lower than that of MTBE. The other daughter compound detected in the influent, TBF, was degraded to concentrations below the detection limit of 0.02 ug/L. BTEX were consistently degraded to significantly lower levels in the effluent throughout the duration of the study (<1 ug/L). A similar high removal efficiency of the other gasoline oxygenates present in the groundwater (TAME, DIPE, and TAA) was also achieved. ...",

Mixtures of alcohols with concentrated sulfuric acid and strong hydrogen peroxide can cause explosions. Example: an explosion will occur if dimethylbenzylcarbinol is added to 90% hydrogen peroxide then acidified with concentrated sulfuric acid. Mixtures of ethyl alcohol with concentrated hydrogen peroxide form powerful explosives. Mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and 1-phenyl-2-methyl propyl alcohol tend to explode if acidified with 70% sulfuric acid [Chem. Eng. News 45(43):73 1967; J, Org. Chem. 28:1893 1963]. Alkyl hypochlorites are violently explosive. They are readily obtained by reacting hypochlorous acid and alcohols either in aqueous solution or mixed aqueous-carbon tetrachloride solutions. Chlorine plus alcohols would similarly yield alkyl hypochlorites. They decompose in the cold and explode on exposure to sunlight or heat. Tertiary hypochlorites are less unstable than secondary or primary hypochlorites [NFPA 491 M, 1991]. Base-catalysed reactions of isocyanates with alcohols should be carried out in inert solvents. Such reactions in the absence of solvents often occur with explosive violence [Wischmeyer 1969].",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 16.7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-methyl-2-butanol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-methyl-2-butanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.3 days. 2-Methyl-2-butanol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-methyl-2-butanol is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 73. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.38X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Methyl-2-butanol may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 2-Methyl-2-butanol is expected to be resistant to biodegradation in soil and water based on results from several screening studies. 2-Methyl-2-butanol contains a tertiary structure which is expected to decrease its biodegradability. If released into water, 2-methyl-2-butanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc value. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 22 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process as alcohols are stable under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-methyl-2-butanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-methyl-2-butanol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-methyl-2-butanol via ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing 2-methyl-2-butanol.

Vapor-phase 2-methyl-2-butanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.3 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.9X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 2-Methyl-2-butanol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

In a 5-day respirometric dilution test, 2-methyl-2-butanol was not degraded(3). In Warburg respirometer tests using activated sludge inoculum from three different treatment plants, 2-methyl-2-butanol at 500 mg/L was slowly biodegraded with a mean value of 3.7% theoretical BOD in 24 hours(4). 2-Methyl-2-butanol at an initial concentration of 219 mg/L was slowly mineralized by a mixed culture, enriched from a petroleum refinery wastewater activated sludge in the presence of tert-amyl methyl ether, with a mu max(or maximum growth rate) of 0.057 per hour(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

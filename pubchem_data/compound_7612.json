When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The C5 fraction of pyrolysis gasoline contains ca. 25 wt% cyclopentadiene with approximately equal proportions of isoprene and of n-pentane, along with other C5 hydrocarbons. From the C5 fraction, cyclopentadiene can be isolated. ... In the first step, cyclopentadiene is dimerized to give dicyclopentadiene by heat soaking the entire C5 fraction, either at normal pressure and 30 - 100 \u00b0C over 5 - 24 hr or at elevated pressure and 140 - 150 \u00b0C. In the second step, the remaining components of the original C5 fraction, which have boiling points of 28 - 50 \u00b0C, are distilled overhead, and crude dicyclopentadiene (bp 172.8 \u00b0C) is obtained in 85 - 90% purity at the bottom of the column. In the third step, the crude dicyclopentadiene is monomerized, either in the liquid phase at 170 - 200 \u00b0C or in the gas phase at 300 - 400 \u00b0C in the presence of diluents such as steam, hydrogen, nitrogen, or methane, to give cyclopentadiene in ca. 95% purity. Cyclopentadiene can be further purified by sequential dimerizations under carefully controlled slow heat soaking and subsequent monomerizations. This procedure largely avoids the codimerization of cyclopentadiene with residual unsaturated C5 impurities, allowing the latter to be removed from dicyclopentadiene by stripping.",

Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. For petroleum crude oil, do not spray water directly into a breached tank car. This can lead to a dangerous boil over. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks in direct contact with flames. For massive fire, use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2024)",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Explodes on contact with fuming nitric acid or a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitrogen tetroxide. Reacts vigorously on contact with potassium hydroxide and other strong bases. Mixtures with air are explosive. Presents a moderate explosion hazard when exposed to heat or flame. Decomposes violently at high temperature and pressure. May form explosive peroxides in storage. Undergoes a spontaneous dimerization at room temperature to give DICYCLOPENTADIENE (C10H12, CAS No: 77-73-6), which is a low-melting solid (melting point: 32.5 \u00b0C). The reaction is strongly exothermic (Hazardous Chemicals Desk Reference, p. 360 (1987)), but occurs sufficiently slowly that cyclopentadiene can be said to be stable at room temperature. The dimerization accounts for the partial or complete solidification of liquid cyclopentadiene in storage. Polymerization occurs more rapidly and extensively at higher temperatures. When heated to 180-200 \u00b0C, cyclopentadiene gives polycyclopentadiene, a white waxy solid. Stronger heating breaks down polycyclopentadiene and re-generates the monomeric cyclopentadiene as a vapor. The vapor decomposes violently at higher temperatures and pressures.",

It is used as a starter compound in the manufacturing of resins and in organic synthesis as a starting material for synthetic prostaglandins, chlorinated insecticides, and formation of sandwich compounds by chelation. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Human exposure may occur during the manufacturing process. Short term exposure: exposure can irritate the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Skin contact causes a burning sensation and rash. Long term exposure: exposure may damage the liver and kidneys. Exposure can cause a skin allergy to develop. If allergy develops, even low exposures may cause symptoms. No further human studies could be located. ANIMAL STUDIES: Exposure to 1,3-Cyclopentadiene vapors produce CNS depression in the frog in 10 minutes, with a complete recovery in 70 minutes.  In rats,  35 repeated daily 7-hour exposures to cyclopentadiene during a period of 53 days at an average concentration of 500 ppm resulted in mild injury to both liver and kidneys described as centrilobular, cloudy swelling of liver cells and cloudy vacuolization of renal tubular epithelium. In contrast, repeated daily exposures at 250 ppm produced no effects in rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, and dogs. In rabbits, subcutaneous injection of 3 cc was a CNS depressing dose with fatal convulsions; however, injections of 0.5 to 1.0 cc did not induce CNS depression. Signs and symptoms during CNS depression included primary motor unrest and a decreased intermittent respiration rate prior to death. The liquid caused marked local irritation, exudates in the pleural and peritoneal cavities, and hyperemia of the kidneys.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 435 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,3-cyclopentadiene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,3-cyclopentadiene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 2.5 hours and 52 min, respectively. Reaction of 1,3-cyclopentadiene with nitrate radicals in the night time atmosphere may also be a relevant removal mechanism. If released to soil, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 80. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. 1,3-Cyclopentadiene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If concentrated solution of 1,3-cyclopentadiene is released to soil or water (spilled), this compound is expected to polymerize spontaneously to dicyclopentadiene. If released into water, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 hours and 3.2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 14 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,3-cyclopentadiene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,3-cyclopentadiene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,3-cyclopentadiene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of contaminated drinking water, and dermal contact. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 435 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 1800 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 hours and 3.2 days, respectively(SRC). Olefins, as a general class, are susceptible to reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen in natural waters(6). Half-lives are typically on the order of 13-14 days for olefins reacting with hydroxyl radicals and 40 days for cyclic olefins reacting with singlet oxygen(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 14(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.25(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 1,3-Cyclopentadiene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The isoenzyme B1B1 was inhibited up to 75%, and higher concn (1,4-TCBQ/GST = 6/1) were needed to reach this maximum effect. For these isoenzyme 75-85% of the maximal amount of inhibition was already reached on incubation of equimolar ratios of 1,4-TCBQ and subunit GST, while approx 1 nmol (0.82-0.95) 1,4-(U-(14)C-TCBQ per nmol subunit GST could be covalently bound. ... GST isoenzymes possess only one cysteine in or near the active site of GST, which is completely responsible for the inhibition. ... Human isoenzyme B2B2 which has no cysteine, was not inhibited and no 1,4TCBQ was inhibited to it. The rate of inhibition was studied at 0 deg: 1,4-TCBQ, trichloro-1,4-benzoquinone and GS-1,4-TCBQ all inhibit GST very fast. Especially for B1B1, the inhibition of glutathione conjugate is significantly faster than inhibition by 1,4-TCBQ: the glutathione moiety seems to target the quinone to the enzyme. ...",

Chloranil's production and use as a dye intermediate, in the manufacture of electrodes for pH measurements, or as a reagent may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to the atmosphere, chloranil will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere, based on a measured vapor pressure of 5.1X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase chloranil is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 14 days. Particulate-phase chloranil may be physically removed from the air by both wet and dry deposition. This compound is expected to be immobile in soil. Chloranil adsorbed strongly onto two soil samples; amending the two soil samples with humic material resulted in the increased adsorption of the pesticide. Volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces should not be significant. This compound is expected to photodegrade on soil surfaces; chloranil, exposed to sunlight, forms the tetrachlorohydroquinone and the trichlorohydroxyquinone in 68% and 28% yields, respectively. Based on limited data, chloranil is expected to biodegrade in soil and water. Chloranil at 50 ug/ml had half-lives of 6,4, and 5 days in non-sterile samples of soil, sewage, and fresh water, respectively. The rates of disappearance of chloranil were slightly lower in the sterilized samples. In water, chloranil will adsorb to dissolved organic matter and particulates. This compound is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.6X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms may occur based on an estimated BCF value of 30. Occupational exposure may occur through ingestion, inhalation or dermal contact with chloranil. (SRC)",

Based on limited data, chloranil is expected to biodegrade in soil(SRC). Chloranil at 50 ug/ml had half-lives of 6, 4, and 5 days in non-sterile samples of soil, sewage, and fresh water, respectively(3). The rates of disappearance of chloranil were slightly lower in the sterilized samples. Different degradation products were reported for the non-sterile samples(3). Volatilization of chloranil is not expected from moist soil surfaces(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.6X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values for vapor pressure(4) and water solubility(5). Volatilization from dry soil surfaces(SRC) should not occur based on a measured vapor pressure of 5.1X10-6 mm Hg(4).

Based on limited data, chloranil should biodegrade in water(SRC). Chloranil at 50 ug/ml had measured half-lives of 6, 4, and 5 days in non-sterile samples of soil, sewage, and fresh water, respectively(2). The rates of disappearance of chloranil were slightly lower in the sterilized samples. Different degradation products were reported for the non-sterile samples(2). Chloranil is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.6X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values for vapor pressure(3) and water solubility(4). An estimated BCF value of 30(1,SRC), from a measured water solubility(4), suggests that chloranil may moderately bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC), according to a recommended classification scheme(5).",

Vapor-phase chloranil is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 14 days(3,SRC).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 14 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1,SRC). Chloranil was not degraded following exposure to UV light for 1 hour(2). When chloranil, in ethanol, is exposed to sunlight it forms the tetrachlorohydroquinone and the trichlorohydroxyquinone in 68% and 28% yields, respectively(3). Rates of disappearance in sterile soil were slightly lower than in non-sterile soil(4). In seawater, complete disappearance required 28 days in both sterile and non-sterile samples; some biodegradation occured in non-sterile samples(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Chloranil adsorbed strongly onto two soil samples (A= pH 7.4, organic carbon of 0.5%; B= pH 8.2, organic carbon 1.0%); adsorption was increased when the two soil samples were amended with humic material. Retention of chloranil was believed due to the chemical reactivity characteristic of its quinonic structure(2). Chloranil was shown to bind to dissolved humic acids in water through either a charge-transfer or electron donor-acceptor mechanism(3).",

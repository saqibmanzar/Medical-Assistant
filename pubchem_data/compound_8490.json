When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

The target genes investigated include several genes encoding for enzymes known to be involved in the detoxification of xenobiotic pollutants, such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), cytochrome P-450s (CYPs), NADPH-dependent reductases, and peroxidases. Starting from A. thaliana TNT-inducible genes, corresponding Populus sequences were retrieved from the JGI Poplar Genome Project database and were used to design gene-specific primers. 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was used as an internal standard and recorded gene expression levels were normalized by reference to nonexposed plants. In three separate experiments, five genes were found to be significantly amplified in leaf tissues by exposure to RDX, including GST (9.7 fold), CYP (1.6 fold), reductases (1.6-1.7 fold), and peroxidase (1.7 fold). In root tissues, only a single GST gene was found to be significantly amplified by exposure to RDX (2.0 fold). These results show, for the first time, that the exposure of poplar plants to RDX results in the induction of several genes that are potentially involved in explosive detoxification.",

Blood, urine, and feces were collected at selected times of 1, 6, 12, and 24 hr post dose. At 24 hr post dose, liver samples were collected. Blood, plasma, liver, and excreta were analyzed for total RDX-derived radioactivity and metabolites were identified. ... Analysis of urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) identified quantifiable levels of two ring-cleavage metabolites, 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal and 4-nitro-2,4-diaza-butanamide, as well as parent RDX. ... Analysis by a more sensitive method (LC/MS/MS) also showed trace amounts of the RDX metabolites 1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (MNX) (in both male and female urine) and 1-nitro-3,5-dinitroso-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (DNX) (in male urine). Analysis of plasma by LC/MS/MS also revealed quantifiable levels of RDX and trace levels of MNX, DNX, and 1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (TNX). None of the liver extracts showed quantifiable levels of RDX or any identifiable metabolites. Most of the radioactivity was in the form of water-soluble high-molecular-weight compounds. RDX when given orally to pigs was rapidly metabolized by loss of two nitro groups followed by ring cleavage.",

Toxic effects of RDX have been reported in terrestrial and aquatic receptors, but investigations regarding the bioaccumulation potential of RDX in aquatic systems are scarce. The objective of the present study was to describe the toxicokinetics of RDX during aqueous exposure for the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and aquatic oligochaetes (Lumbriculus variegatus) and to compare the amount of RDX accumulation in juvenile catfish following aqueous exposure only, dietary exposure only, and a combination of dietary and aqueous exposure. The toxicokinetics measurements included bioconcentration factors (BCFs), uptake rates, elimination rates, and biological half-lives. First-order, single-compartment models described the toxicokinetics for both species. Uptake of RDX into oligochaetes was relatively rapid (uptake clearance constant [k(u)] of 5.17 mL/g/hr) compared to that in catfish (k(u) = 1.28 mL/g/hr). However, elimination also was more rapid in oligochaetes, with biological half-lives of 0.28 and 1.09 hr for oligochaetes and catfish, respectively. Thus, both species had very similar estimated BCFs of 2.1 mL/g for oligochaetes and 2.0 mL/g for catfish. Accumulation of RDX in fish that were fed oligochaetes exposed to an exceedingly high water concentration of RDX was minimal. The present investigation indicates that RDX uptake via the aqueous route is the expected dominant uptake pathway, with dietary uptake contributing minimally to the overall body burden in fish inhabiting RDX-contaminated sites. Because of the exceedingly low bioaccumulative potential and low reported toxicity of RDX, the presence of this explosive in aquatic systems is unlikely to pose unacceptable risks to invertebrates and fish.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The onset of seizures resulting in death was observed in the avian model Northern bobwhite after oral dosing with RDX beginning at 8 mg/kg/day in subacute (14 days) exposures, whereas affective doses of the TNT derivative, 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), caused gastrointestinal impacts, lethargy, and emaciation in subacute and subchronic (60 days) exposures. To assess and contrast the potential neurotoxicogenomic effects of these MCs, a Northern bobwhite microarray was developed consisting of 4119 complementary DNA (cDNA) features enriched for differentially-expressed brain transcripts from exposures to RDX and 2,6-DNT. RDX affected hundreds of genes in brain tissue, whereas 2,6-DNT affected few (<or= 17), indicating that 2,6-DNT exposure had relatively little impact on the brain in comparison to RDX. Birds exhibiting RDX-induced seizures accumulated over 20x more RDX in brain tissues in comparison to non-seizing birds even within a common dose. In parallel, expression patterns were unrelated among seizing and non-seizing birds exposed to equivalent RDX doses. In birds experiencing seizures, genes related to neuronal electrophysiology and signal transduction were significantly affected. Comparative toxicology revealed strong similarity in acute exposure effects between RDX and the organochlorine insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) regarding both molecular mechanisms and putative mode of action. In a manner similar to DDT, RDX /may/ elicits seizures by inhibition of neuronal cell repolarization postaction potential leading to heightened neuronal excitability and seizures facilitated by multiple molecular mechanisms.",

Sequencing of SAGE libraries from control and RDX-exposed root tissues revealed induction of genes known to respond to a variety of general stresses. Among the highly induced genes were several encoding molecular chaperones and transcription factors as well as vacuolar proteins and peroxidases. Strongly repressed transcripts included ones encoding ribosomal proteins, a cyclophilin, a katanin, and a peroxidase. Comparison of the transcriptional profile for the RDX response to a profile previously described for Arabidopsis roots exposed to trinitrotoluene (TNT) revealed significant differences in the inferred gene expression patterns. This suggests that Arabidopsis employs drastically different mechanisms for coping with these two compounds. With respect to the goal of engineering plants to better tolerate and degrade explosives at contaminated sites, these results suggest that enhancement of different genes and metabolic pathways may be required to deal effectively with each type of explosive. This has ramifications for phytoremediation efforts since many contaminated sites harbor both compounds.",

In this study, we examined the impact of a single orally administered RDX dose on the brain, using a combination of analytical chemistry and gene chip microarrays. At nominal doses of 3 and 18 mg/kg in male adult rats, a time course of RDX tissue levels showed peak brain concentrations at 3.5 hours, returning to baseline at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. RNA from dosed and control animals was hybridized to Affymetrix Rat 230 2.0 arrays. Analysis was performed in JMP Genomics with the differentially expressed gene cut-off at p>0.001. /The study/ found sets of genes that were early and late responders to RDX treatment.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

In order to understand the joint effects of TNT and RDX on earthworms, an important ecological and bioindicator species at the molecular level, we sampled worms (Eisenia fetida) exposed singly or jointly to TNT (50 mg/kg soil) and RDX (30 mg/kg soil) for 28 days and profiled gene expression in an interwoven loop designed microarray experiment using a 4k-cDNA array. Lethality, growth and reproductive endpoints were measured.  Sublethal doses of TNT and RDX had no significant effects on the survival and growth of earthworms, but significantly reduced cocoon and juvenile counts. The mixture exhibited more pronounced reproductive toxicity than each single compound, suggesting an additive interaction between the two compounds. In comparison with the controls, we identified 321 differentially expressed transcripts in TNT treated worms, 32 in RDX treated worms, and only 6 in mixture treated worms. Of the 329 unique differentially expressed transcripts, 294 were affected only by TNT, 24 were common to both TNT and RDX treatments, and 3 were common to all treatments. The reduced effects on gene expression in the mixture exposure suggest that RDX might interact in an antagonistic manner with TNT at the gene expression level. The disagreement between gene expression and reproduction results may be attributed to sampling time, absence of known reproduction-related genes, and lack of functional information for many differentially expressed transcripts. A gene potentially related to reproduction (echinonectin) was significantly depressed in TNT or RDX exposed worms and may be linked to reduced fecundity. Sublethal doses of TNT and RDX affected many biological pathways from innate immune response to oogenesis, leading to reduced reproduction without affecting survival and growth. A complex interaction between mixtures of RDX and TNT was observed at the gene expression level that requires further study of the dynamics of gene expression and reproductive activities in E. fetida. These efforts will be essential to gain an understanding of the additive reproductive toxicity between RDX and TNT.",

The toxicokinetics of (14)C-RDX-derived radioactivity was examined following administration of a single oral dose formulated as an aqueous suspension in 0.1% carboxymethylcellulose at a target dose level of 43 mg/kg ... to male and female Yucatan mini pigs. Blood was collected at 1, 6, 12 and 24 hr post dose from each animal. Urine and feces were collected through 24 hr post dose. Animals were sacrificed at 24 hr post dose and selected tissues collected. Blood, plasma, tissues, and excreta were analyzed for total radioactivity. Female mini pigs vomited and experienced tremors and convulsions within 1 hr post dose. Only vomiting was observed in male mini pigs, occurring within 2 hr post dose. Animals appeared normal by 2.5 hr post dose. Urine was the major route for elimination of (14)C-RDX-derived radioactivity, with 17.3 and 17.6% of the radioactive dose, respectively, in males and females. RDX was well absorbed. Feces accounted for less than 1% of administered dose and gastrointestinal contents for about 5.6% of the dose. The distribution of (14)C-RDX-derived radioactivity was extensive, with radioactivity observed in all collected tissues. The highest concentrations of radioactivity were observed in liver and kidney. The calculated percent of radioactive dose was high in liver (3.5 to 5.8%) and muscle (2.5 to 4.7%).",

The ALDs for females and males were 187 and 280 mg/kg, respectively. Data from the 14-day dietary trial suggested that RDX exposure inhibited food consumption, weight gain, and egg production. Dietary RDX exposure for 90-days produced a dose-dependant decreasing trend in total feed consumption, total egg production, and hen-housed production parameters.",

Exposure to these N-nitroso metabolites may occur in areas contaminated with explosives, as anaerobic degradation occurs via some bacteria and is one remediation strategy used for RDX. Few papers report acute oral toxicity and none have evaluated age dependent toxicity of RDX or its N-nitroso metabolites. Median lethal dose (LD50) was determined in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) of three age classifications 21 d, 50 d, and 200 d for RDX, MNX, and TNX using the US EPA up-and-down procedure (UDP). Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine and N-nitroso metabolites caused similar overt signs of toxicity. Median lethal dose for 21 d deer mice were 136, 181, and 338 mg/kg for RDX, MNX, and TNX, respectively. Median lethal dose for 50 d deer mice were 319, 575, and 338 mg/kg for RDX, MNX, and TNX, respectively. Median lethal dose for 200 d deer mice were 158, 542, and 999 mg/kg for RDX, MNX, and TNX, respectively. These data suggest that RDX is the most potent compound tested, and age dependent toxicity may exist for all compounds and could play a role in RDX and RDX N-nitroso metabolite ecological risk evaluation of terrestrial wildlife at RDX contaminated sites.",

Often, these areas are valuable habitats used by birds. To evaluate the possibility of adverse effects in birds, the effects from oral exposures of 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT) and 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) were tested using a controlled dosing regime in northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). Nine groups of birds of mixed sex received either corn oil or 50, 100, 190, or 350 mg 2,6-DNT/kg body weight/day or 20, 80, 125, or 180 mg RDX/kg body weight/day mixed in corn oil via gavage for 14 day. Etiology of disease was markedly different between compounds. Increased RDX exposure caused an inverse relationship to time of death, symptoms including clonic followed by tonic convulsions, and death shortly thereafter. Brain concentrations of RDX postmortem, however, were relatively consistent (mean +/- standard error, 20.5 +/- 2.9 mg/kg tissue). Observations of 2,6-DNT effects included gastrointestinal distress, dehydration, and a reduction in body mass and feed consumption. Together, these data suggest that RDX is more toxic from short, repeated exposures than 2,6-DNT, resulting in central nervous system-related effects, whereas 2,6-DNT causes gastrointestinal disturbances at higher exposures.",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 4.1X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cyclonite will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase cyclonite will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Direct photochemical degradation of cyclonite on aerosols may also be an important fate process. If released to soil, cyclonite is expected to have high to moderate mobility based upon Koc values of 42-167. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Under aerobic conditions, when added to 3 different soil samples and incubated for 56 days cyclonite was not biodegraded. Cyclonite was mineralized by mixed populations of microorganisms under anaerobic conditions in systems such as sediment, groundwater, lakes and other shallow waters when supplemental carbon was provided. If released into water, cyclonite is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the reported Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. BCFs of 0.6 to 11 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis should not be an important fate process in fresh waters, although cyclonite was hydrolyzed in sea water with 11.6% loss after 112 days. In water, the dominant fate of cyclonite is expected to be direct photochemical degradation by sunlight; experimental half-lives of a few weeks are reported in translucent waters. Cyclonite was reported to phytophotolyze in reed canary grass and poplar tissue. Cyclonite was also broken down when exposed to green rust and elemental iron. Occupational exposure to cyclonite may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyclonite is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the population in the vicinity of army bases may be exposed to cyclonite via dermal contact with contaminated water. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 4.1X10-9 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 59.7 mg/L(4). According to a classification scheme(5), BCFs of 0.6 in sheepshead minnows(6) to 11 in fathead minnows(7), suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Hydrolysis should not be an important fate process in fresh waters, although cyclonite was hydrolyzed in sea water with 11.6% loss after 112 days(8). In water, the dominant fate of cyclonite is expected to be direct photochemical degradation by sunlight; experimental half-lives of a few weeks are reported in translucent waters(2). Cyclonite was mineralized by mixed populations of microorganisms under anaerobic conditions in systems such as groundwater, lakes and other shallow waters when supplemental carbon was provided(2,9-10); under aerobic conditions, however, biodegradation proceeds very slowly(11).",

These degradation intermediates are susceptible to aerobic and anaerobic mineralization; however, the rate is nearly an order of magnitude higher under anaerobic conditions(1). Cyclonite, at concentrations of 50 or 100 ug/L, was completely removed after 4 days under anaerobic conditions using a sewage sludge inoculum(1). Identified metabolites included hydrazines, dimethyl hydrazines, dimethylnitrosamines, azoxymethane, formaldehyde and methanol(1,2). In the laboratory, cyclonite in lagoon waste water did not undergo anaerobic degradation for approximately 90 days (yeast extract repeatedly added as a nutrient)(3). The third subculture, however, degraded 12.4 ppm of cyclonite in 20 days. Degradation in 5 days ensued when yeast extract was added as a nutrient(3). Anaerobic degradation was shown to occur in the presence of a cometabolite, 50 ppm yeast extract, during die-away studies using river water (10 ppm cyclonite) and pond water (10 ppm cyclonite); degradation was complete in 10 and 8 days, respectively(4). Experiments including live and sterile controls show that hydrogen can act as the sole electron donor for anaerobic cyclonite transformation by aquifer bacteria(5). Anaerobic soil cultures containing cyclonite at 30 ppm, plus added potato starch as a supplemental carbon source, were able to completely degrade cyclonite within 24 days with no identifiable intermediates detected(7). Cyclonite at a concentration of 20 uM was anaerobically degraded to 1.3 uM in 15 days, this included a 5 day lag time(8). With amendment of ethanol and propylene glycol 20 uM of cyclonite was degraded in 9 days to <0.1 and 2 uM, respectively, with no lag time(8). Greater than 85% of (14)C labeled cyclonite was mineralized to (14)CO2 in aquifer sediment microcosms under native, manganese-reducing, anaerobic conditions in 300 days(9).",

Alkaline hydrolysis (pH 10) of 2.75 umol cyclonite in the presence of water resulted in the formation of NO2-, N2O2, formaldehyde, and 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal over the course of 17 days(3). Exposure of aqueous solutions of cyclonite to UV light resulted in the formation of nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, formaldehyde, nitrous oxide, formamide, and N-nitroso-methylenediamine(4). The experimental half lives determined for the sunlight photolysis of cyclonite in distilled water, Holston River (TN) water, and Searsville Pond water were 13, 14, and 9 days (Jan 1980), respectively(4). The rate constant for photolytic transformation of cyclonite in a Louisiana munitions plant wastewater lagoon was determined as 1X10+3/day to 0.52X10+3/day (winter) and 5.0X10+3/day to 2.5X10+3/day (summer), for water depths of 15 and 30 cm/respectively(5). Cyclonite was phytophotolyzed in reed canary grass leaves exposed to simulated sunlight to the primary products on nitrous oxide and 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal(6). Cyclonite was shown to degrade in poplar tissue (Populus deltoides x nigra DN-34) with increased rates when exposed to light(7). Cyclonite was degraded abiotically in the presence of carbonate and sulfate green rust suspended in solutions containing common groundwater anions(8). Decomposition products of formaldehyde, nitrous oxide gas and ammonium were the major end products accounting for about 70 and 50% of the carbon and nitrogen mass balance, respectively(8). Cyclonite was degraded to formaldehyde, ammonium, nitrous oxide and other soluble products in the presence of elemental iron(9).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The bioconcentration factors in edible tissue at the lower concentration ranged from 4.0 in catfish to 5.9 in fathead minnow and were slightly higher in viscera (5 in catfish to 11 in fathead minnows)(1). Elimination of all cyclonite from the fish tissues at the low dose exposure occurred after 14 days in the bluegill and catfish but not totally in the minnow. At the higher dose, minnows and catfish eliminated 70-84% of the accumulated cyclonite but no elimination occurred in the bluegill(1). The BCFs of cyclonite in sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) are reported as 1.0, 2.1, 1.6, 0.6 and 0.7 in the liver, viscera, gills, body remains and whole body, respectively, exposed for 24 hours at a cyclonite concentration of 8.11-8.14 mg/L(2).

Aquatic plants grown in cyclonite contaminated groundwater also were shown to accumulate cyclonite(1,2). In an ecosystem study using sediment, characteristic aquatic vegetation, and cyclonite contaminated groundwater from the Milan Ammunition Plant in Milan, TN, the initial cyclonite concentration in groundwater was 1,529 ug/L(2). Following a 13-day incubation, submerged plant specie concentrations were 976, 42, and 1,496 ug/L for Elodea, pondweed, and water star-grass, respectively; emergent plant concentrations were 3196, 1156, 704, and <20 ug/L for parrot-feather, sweet-flag, R. canary grass, and wool-grass, respectively(2). In an ecosystem study designed to show the effects of cyclonite in aged soil, cyclonite, present at 14 to 1540 mg/kg dry weight resulted in a mean BCF of 1251 in earthworms (Eisenia fetida), and mean BCFs of 2545 and 3594 in the plants Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Medicago sativa (alfalfa), respectively(3). Uptake of cyclonite was rapid peaking in concentration at 7 days, followed by a decrease to give a measured BCF of 1.86 in earthworms (Eisenia fetida)(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Adsorption of cyclonite was measured using four soil columns: a bentonite/sand column, a Norwood soil column (fine-silty, pH 7.4, organic matter 0.32%), and two Kolin soil (fine-silty, pH 4.4, CEC = 16.3 cmol/kg) columns, one from the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant and another collected from an uncontaminated site 100 meters from the contaminated site(2). There was retention of cyclonite in the bentonite/sand column with the relative concentration reaching 0.5 after 3 pore volumes; retention appeared to be due to local equilibrium as there was little tailing during desorption. Total recovery exceeded 90% by 11 pore volumes(2). Only limited retardation of cyclonite was observed in the Norwood soil and uncontaminated Kolin soil with 100 and 95% recovery, respectively, reported in 5 pore volumes(2). 100% of the initial concentration of cyclonite was released by the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant soil in the first 15 pore volumes(2). Cyclonite does not strongly interact with most soil constituents with retention apparently controlled by soil organic matter and, possibly, by the nature of the clay(3). Using soil flow-through columns, cyclonite adsorption coefficients of 0.65 and 0.48 cu cm/g where determined using a Plymouth loamy sand (7.05 CEC; 7.8 g/kg organic carbon; 875 g/kg sand; 75 g/kg silt; 50 g/kg clay; pH 5.1) from Camp Edwards, MA and Alder silt loam (7.83 CEC; 2.0 g/kg organic carbon; 114 g/kg sand; 841 g/kg silt; 45 g/kg clay; pH 8.2) from Vicksburg, MS, respectively(4). Cyclonite was added to the columns at a concentration of 10.03 mg/L; soil bulk density was 1.60 and 1.27 g/cu cm, respectively. Sorption was shown to be rate limited(4). In sandy soil from the Massachusetts Military Reservation, cyclonite had a reported sorption rate of 0.37 L/kg and a desorption rate of 1.5 L/kg(5). Based on multiple component column transport tests, cyclonite broke through rapidly(5).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (average duration of 10 weeks) revealed an approximate 1.6- to 1.7-fold increase in mortality among geriatric patients receiving atypical antipsychotic drugs (i.e., quetiapine, aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone) compared with that in patients receiving placebo. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5% compared with a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

CYP2D6 also regulates the metabolism of quetiapine. In one study, three metabolites of N-desalkylquetiapine were identified. Two of the metabolites were identified as N-desalkylquetiapine sulfoxide and 7-hydroxy-N-desalkylquetiapine. CYP2D6 has been found to be responsible for metabolism of quetiapine to 7-hydroxy-N-desalkylquetiapine, a pharmacologically active metabolite.

The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation, mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and oxidation of the terminal alcohol to a carboxylic acid. The major sulfoxide metabolite of quetiapine is inactive. Quetiapine also undergoes hydroxylation of the dibenzothiazepine ring, O-deakylation, N-dealkylation, and phase II conjugation. The 7-hydroxy and 7-hydroxy-\nN-delakylated metabolites appear to be active, but are present in very low concentrations.\nRoute of Elimination: Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism. Following a single oral dose of 14C-quetiapine, less than 1% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 73% and 20% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.\nHalf Life: 6 hours",

In contrast to typical antipsychotic agents (e.g., chlorpromazine) but like other atypical antipsychotic drugs (e.g., clozapine), quetiapine does not cause sustained elevations in serum prolactin concentrations and therefore is unlikely to produce adverse effects such as amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and impotence.",

Current evidence suggests that the clinical potency and antipsychotic efficacy of both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs generally are related to their affinity for and blockade of central dopamine D2 receptors; however, antagonism at dopamine D2 receptors does not appear to account fully for the antipsychotic effects of quetiapine. Results of in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that quetiapine is a comparatively weak antagonist at dopamine D2 receptors. Receptor binding studies show quetiapine is a weak antagonist at D1 receptors. Although their role in eliciting the pharmacologic effects of antipsychotic agents remains to be fully elucidated, dopamine D3, D4, and D5 receptors also have been identified; quetiapine possesses no affinity for the dopamine D4 receptor.",

This view is being supported by gene microarray studies showing the downregulation of genes related to oligodendrocyte function and myelination in schizophrenic brain compared to control subjects. However, there is currently little information available on the response of oligodendrocytes to antipsychotic drugs (APDs), which could be invaluable for corroborating the oligodendrocyte hypothesis. In this study we found: (1) quetiapine (QUE, an atypical APD) treatment in conjunction with addition of growth factors increased the proliferation of neural progenitors isolated from the cerebral cortex of embryonic rats; (2) QUE directed the differentiation of neural progenitors to oligodendrocyte lineage through extracellular signal-related kinases; (3) addition of QUE increased the synthesis of myelin basic protein and facilitated myelination in rat embryonic cortical aggregate cultures; (4) chronic administration of QUE to C57BL/6 mice prevented cortical demyelination and concomitant spatial working memory impairment induced by cuprizone, a neurotoxin. These findings suggest a new neural mechanism of antipsychotic action of QUE, and help to establish a role for oligodendrocytes in the etiopathology and treatment of schizophrenia.",

Short-term efficacy of quetiapine for the management of schizophrenia has been established by placebo-controlled studies of 6 weeks' duration principally in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Quetiapine is used alone or in conjunction with lithium or divalproex sodium for the management of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Quetiapine also is used for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: The most common adverse effects reported in 5% or more of patients receiving quetiapine therapy for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and at a frequency twice that reported among patients receiving placebo in clinical trials include somnolence, sedation, asthenia, lethargy, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, increased ALT, weight gain, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, postural hypotension, and pharyngitis. The development of cataracts in association with quetiapine was observed in animal studies. Lens changes also have been reported in some patients receiving long-term quetiapine therapy, although a causal relationship has not been established. Seizures occurred in 0.6% of patients receiving quetiapine in controlled clinical trials. Geriatric patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs appear to be at an increased risk of death compared with that among patients receiving placebo. Worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior may occur in both adult and pediatric patients with major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders, whether or not they are taking antidepressants. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal syndrome requiring immediate discontinuance of the drug and intensive symptomatic treatment, has been reported in patients receiving antipsychotic agents, including quetiapine. Contact dermatitis, maculopapular rash, and photosensitivity reactions were reported infrequently during clinical trials. Anaphylaxis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported during postmarketing surveillance. Quetiapine appears to be distributed into human milk in relatively small amounts. The effect of quetiapine on labor and delivery is unknown. Safety and efficacy of quetiapine in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age with bipolar depression have not been established. Quetiapine overdose causes central nervous system depression and sinus tachycardia. In large overdoses, patients may require intubation and ventilation for associated respiratory depression. Although a prolonged QTc occurs, its clinical significance is unclear because it is most likely caused by an overcorrection caused by the tachycardia. No evidence of clastogenic potential was obtained in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes. ANIMAL STUDIES: Quetiapine caused a dose-related increase in pigment deposition in thyroid gland in a mouse 2 year carcinogenicity study. Doses were 75-750 mg/kg. The identity of the pigment could not be determined, but was found to be co-localized with quetiapine in thyroid gland follicular epithelial cells. The functional effects and the relevance of this finding to human risk are unknown. In dogs receiving quetiapine for 6 or 12 months, but not for 1 month, focal triangular cataracts occurred at the junction of posterior sutures in the outer cortex of the lens at a dose of 100 mg/kg. This finding may be due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by quetiapine. Quetiapine caused a dose related reduction in plasma cholesterol levels in repeat-dose dog and monkey studies; however, there was no correlation between plasma cholesterol and the presence of cataracts in individual dogs. The appearance of delta-8-cholestanol in plasma is consistent with inhibition of a late stage in cholesterol biosynthesis in these species. There also was a 25% reduction in cholesterol content of the outer cortex of the lens observed in a special study in quetiapine treated female dogs. The teratogenic potential of quetiapine was studied in rats and rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis. No evidence of a teratogenic effect was detected in rats at doses of 25 to 200 mg/kg or in rabbits at 25 to 100 mg/kg. There was, however, evidence of embryo/fetal toxicity. Delays in skeletal ossification were detected in rat fetuses at doses of 50 and 200 mg/ kg and in rabbits at 50 and 100 mg/kg. Fetal body weight was reduced in rat fetuses at 200 mg/kg and rabbit fetuses at 100 mg/kg. There was an increased incidence of a minor soft tissue anomaly (carpal/tarsal flexure) in rabbit fetuses at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Evidence of maternal toxicity (i.e., decreases in body weight gain and/or death) was observed at the high dose in the rat study and at all doses in the rabbit study. In a peri/ postnatal reproductive study in rats, no drug-related effects were observed at doses of 1, 10, and 20 mg/kg. However, in a preliminary peri/postnatal study, there were increases in fetal and pup death, and decreases in mean litter weight at 150 mg/kg. The mutagenic potential of quetiapine was tested in six in vitro bacterial gene mutation assays and in an in vitro mammalian gene mutation assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. However, sufficiently high concentrations of quetiapine may not have been used for all tester strains. Quetiapine did produce a reproducible increase in mutations in one Salmonella typhimurium tester strain in the presence of metabolic activation. No evidence of clastogenic potential was obtained in the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats.",

However, it is thought that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2 (5HT<sub>2</sub>) receptor antagonism. Although quetiapine is known to bind other receptors with similar affinity, only the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT<sub>2</sub> receptor binding is responsible for quetiapine's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia.",

Discuss how to monitor this with your healthcare providers.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.

Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (average duration of 10 weeks) revealed an approximate 1.6- to 1.7-fold increase in mortality among geriatric patients receiving atypical antipsychotic drugs (i.e., quetiapine, aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone) compared with that in patients receiving placebo. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5% compared with a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature.

This finding may be due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by quetiapine. Quetiapine caused a dose related reduction in plasma cholesterol levels in repeat-dose dog and monkey studies; however, there was no correlation between plasma cholesterol and the presence of cataracts in individual dogs. The appearance of delta-8-cholestanol in plasma is consistent with inhibition of a late stage in cholesterol biosynthesis in these species. There also was a 25% reduction in cholesterol content of the outer cortex of the lens observed in a special study in quetiapine treated female dogs.",

Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5% compared with a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.4X10-14 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates quetiapine will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase quetiapine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Quetiapine contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, quetiapine is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 3.2X10+4. The estimated pKa values of quetiapine are 2.78 and 7.46, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.5X10-18 atm-cu m/mole. Quetiapine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, quetiapine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 31 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to quetiapine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where quetiapine is produced or used. Exposure to quetiapine among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug, an antipsychotic. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

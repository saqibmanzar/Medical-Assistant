When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

(14)C labeled 2-chloronitrobenzene or 4-chloronitrobenzene was applied to the shaved backs of male Fischer 344 rats at an application rates equivalent to doses of 0, 0.65, 6.5 or 65 mg/kg. Urine and feces samples were collected for 24, 48 or 72 hr and assayed for (14)C activity. Exhaled volatiles were collected in ethanol traps and analyzed. After 72 hr, the rats were /sacrificed/ and their skin removed and analyzed for (14)C activity. Approx 21-27% and 43 to 45% of the 2-chloronitrobenzene and 4-chloronitrobenzene doses, respectively, were eliminated in the urine over 72 hr. Approx 11 to 15% of the 2-chloronitrobenzene dose and 5 to 12% of the 4-chloronitrobenzene dose were excreted over 72 hr. Fecal excretion of 4-chloronitrobenzene showed a dose related incr which was statistically significant only when comparing the 65 mg/kg dose with the 0.65 mg/kg dose. Approx 27 to 32% of 2-chloronitrobenzene derived radioactivity and 13 to 15% of the 4-chloronitrobenzene derived (14)C activity were recovered in the ethanol traps. The amt of collected radioactivity did not depend on dose and consisted of unchanged 2-chloronitrobenzene or 4-chloronitrobenzene. ... An analysis of all (14)C data indicated that the dermal absorption of 2-chloronitrobenzene ... was linear over the entire dose range. Dermal absorption of 4-chloronitrobenzene was linear only after application of 0.65 and 6.5 mg/kg. /Results indicate/ that under the experimental conditions used at least 33 to 40% and 51 to 62% of the applied 2-chloronitrobenzene and 4-chloronitrobenzene doses, respectively, are absorbed from the skin of rats. ... Dermal absorption of 2-chloronitrobenzene is linear over the dose range 0.65 mg/kg to 65 mg/kg. Dermal absorption of 4-chloronitrobenzene is essentially unaffected by dose.",

Blood and urine samples were collected periodically from 1 to 169 hr after dosing. Plasma p-nitrochlorobenzene concn were determined at these times. The urine samples were analyzed for p-nitrochlorobenzene metabolites. The plasma concentrations of p-chloronitrobenzene following injection with the 30 and 100 mg/kg doses decreased linearly with time. The decrease following 333 mg/kg p-chloronitrobenzene was nonlinear. The mean residence time of p-chloronitrobenzene, determined from the first normal moment, increased with increasing dose. Systemic p-chloronitrobenzene clearance, defined as the ratio of the dose to the area under the plasma concn time curve, decreased with increasing p-chlorobenzene dose. The observations indicated that clearance of p-chloronitrobenzene from the plasma was nonlinear. N-acetyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-L-cysteine was the major urinary metabolite accounting for approx 30% of each administered p-chloronitrobenzene dose and 50% of the total metabolite concn. The rate constants for estimation of each p-chloronitrobenzene metabolite decr with increasing dose and were larger than those for production of the metabolites. The elimination rate of N-acetyl-S-(4-nitrophenyl)-L-cysteine, however, was proportional to p-chloronitrobenzene.",

After dermal application 45 % of the dose was excreted in the urine and 12 % in the feces within 72 hrs (up to 30 % of the dose was recovered in the protective device and ethanol trap (collects volatiles)). In both application routes, it was shown that at very high doses the initial urinary excretion rate is delayed and the initial fecal excretion is markedly depressed. These observations at high doses may reflect the reabsorption from greater biliary excretion rates suggesting involvement of the enterohepatic cycle, but there are no signs of accumulation of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene or one of its metabolites. 24 hours post oral application the highest concentrations of the compound were found in the fat, followed by blood cells, skeletal muscles , liver and kidney. At 72 hours greatest concentration was found in the blood cells followed by fat, skeletal muscles and liver.",

In addition, condensation of 4-chloronitrobenzene with 2,4-dichlorophenol gives 2,4-dichloro-4'-nitrodiphenyl ether, which is used as a herbicide (nitrofen); 4-chloronitrobenzene can also be reacted with aniline to give 4-nitrodiphenylamine, which on reductive N-alkylation gives important antioxidants for rubber",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

                                                    "String": "1-Chloro-4-nitrobenzene is rapidly absorbed via skin, gastrointestinal tract or respiratory tract and distributed in the tissue predominantly in fat, blood cells, skeletal muscles, liver and kidney. Most of the substance was excreted with the urine followed by excretion with feces. 1-Chloro-4-nitrobenzene undergoes three major types of transformation in vivo in mammals: nitro-group reduction, displacement of the chloride in glutathione conjugation, and ring hydroxylation. From accidental exposure of workers to 1-chloro-4-nitrophenol, large amounts of 2-chloro-5- nitrophenol, N-acetyl-S-(4-nitrophenyl)-L-cysteine, 4-chloroaniline and 4-chloroformanilide were identified. The oral LD50 for 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene in male rats is 294 or 694 mg/kg bw and in female rats 565 or 664 mg/kg bw. Cyanotic appearance was the predominant symptom. The ...  LC50 level could not be reached up to 16100 mg/cu m during a 4-hrs exposure against vapor and microcrystalline particles. The LD50 (dermal) for male rats is 750 mg/kg bw and for female rats 1722 mg/kg bw; the LD50 for male rabbits is 3550 mg/kg bw and for female rabbits 2510 mg/kg bw after acute dermal application. Cyanotic appearance was the predominant symptom. For the evaluation of acute toxicity it has to be taken into account that 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene is a methemoglobin forming chemical. Experience with human exposure: all available reports relate to mixed exposure, frequently in combination with 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene and/or nitrobenzene. A critical aspect in this context is that 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene is rapidly absorbed via skin and the respiratory tract. The signs of acute intoxication include methaemoglobinaemia, vomiting, headache and in severe cases collapse. The available study-reports on skin irritation have deficiencies with regard to the description of the results, nevertheless, 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene is judged to be slightly irritating to the skin (intact or scarificed) of rabbits ... Due to the limited and poor quality information available regarding skin sensitization it cannot be concluded whether or not the chemical has a sensitizing activity. The repeated dose toxicity via inhalation has been examined in rats for a period of 4 weeks and 13 weeks. In both studies, NOAECs were not achieved, the LOAECs were 5 mg/cu m (4 week-study) and 1.5 ppm (9.81 mg/vu m, 13 week-study), respectively, based on methemoglobinemia (3 % and 4 %, respectively) as the most sensitive effect. ... The repeated dose toxicity via inhalation for a period of 13 weeks in mice revealed a NOAEC for histopathologic injury of 6 ppm (39.24 mg/cu m). As target organs liver, kidney (rat only), spleen and blood were identified in both species. Similarly, repeated dose toxicity by oral administration in rats ... revealed changes predominantly consistent with methemoglobinemia. ... 1-Chloro-4-nitrobenzene induced reverse mutations in bacteria. It was not mutagenic in mammalian cells in vitro (HPRT test) and in insects in vivo. A mouse lymphoma assay was positive. In vitro it induced chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges at high doses; no UDS in rat hepatocytes was reported. The chemical induced micronuclei in mouse bone marrow in vivo at a toxic dose. In rat bone marrow it did not induce chromosomal aberrations in vivo. An in vivo SCE test was weakly positive in bone marrow cells of Chinese hamsters. DNA strand breaks were observed in liver, kidney and brain of mice. 1-Chloro-4-nitrobenzene is consequently capable of expressing mutagenic activity in vivo with low potency. A combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study ... with 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene in rats produced an increased incidence in interstitial cell tumours of the testes which were within the range of the historical control data and evaluated as not compound related. ...  In another rat study ... reported in brief, no tumors were found. In the available study with mice ... reported in brief, vascular tumors (localization not specified) were found. ... Overall, taking into consideration the results of the genotoxicity tests and the limitations in the available long term studies, a carcinogenic potential cannot be ruled out. Toxicity to reproduction of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene has been examined in rats and mice by oral administration. In a two generation study with rats ...  no impairment of fertility was observed up to 5 mg/kg bw (high dose group), nevertheless, at this dose histopathological effects in testes were observed. But the evaluation of the effect on the male reproductive tract is limited because the testes in the low and mid dose group were not examined histopathologically. Therefore a NOAEL (male reproductive organ toxicity) was not established. ... In mice a study was performed using the NTP continuous breeding protocol. The NOAEL (fertility) is 125 mg/kg bw/day, the LOAEL (offspring general toxicity) is 62.5 mg/kg bw/day. The NOAEL (adult general toxicity) is 125 mg/kg bw/day, but full evaluation is not possible because evaluation of the animals of the two lower groups were very limited. Two subchronic inhalation studies with rats and mice with histopathologic evaluations on reproductive organs are available. There was evidence of decreased spermatogenesis (24 ppm) and decrease in average estrous cycle length in rats exposed to 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene (6 ppm and above). In female mice an increase in estrous cycle length was noted at the highest exposure group (24 ppm). Developmental toxicity of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene has been examined in rats and rabbits by oral administration ... a NOAEL for maternal toxicity was not achieved, the LOAEL(maternal toxicity) is 5 mg/kg bw/day; the NOAEL (developmental toxicity) is 15 mg/kg bw/day. The study with rabbits suffered from methodology deficiencies. Due to high mortality rate at the highest dose level, only two doses could be evaluated: the LOAEL (maternal toxicity) is 5 mg/kg bw/day and the LOAEL (developmental toxicity) is 5 mg/kg bw/day. Thus, in both species developmental toxicity occurred in the presence of maternal toxicity. There are indications of immunotoxic potency following single and repeated applications of 1-chloro-4- nitrobenzene. Concerning the toxicity of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene towards aquatic species reliable experimental results of tests with fish, daphnia, and algae are available. The acute toxicity determined for fish (Brachydanio rerio) was of 14.36 mg/L (96 hr LC50) and 2 mg/L (48 hr) for Leuciscus idus and for daphnia (Daphnia magna) of 2.7 mg/L (48 hr-EC50). In the growth rate tests with algae (Scenedesmus subspicatus) the values 4.9 mg/L (48 hr-ErC10) and 16 mg/L (48 hr- ErC50) were achieved while for Chlorella pyrenoidosa an effect value of 4.9 mg/L (96 hr-EC50) was found. The prolonged toxicity to fish (Brachydanio rerio) for the endpoint sub-lethal effects (feeding, malposition) was evaluated through a 14 days test and a NOEC value of 1.53 mg/l was determined. Two chronic tests with Daphnia (Daphnia magna) are available that were performed with analytical monitoring of the test substance concentration. In one test a 21 d-EC10 of 0.103 mg/L (effective concentration) was observed for the endpoint reproduction rate. The second test resulted in a 21d-NOEC of 0.19 mg/L (effective concentration) for the same endpoint. Calculating the geometric mean of these two values gives a NOEC of 0.14 mg/Ll. A PNECaqua = 2.8 g/L is derived from this value, using an assessment factor of 50.",

For doses ranging from 0.65 to 65 mg/kg of either chemical, 33%; to 40%; of 2-chloronitrobenzene and 51%; to 62%; of 4-chloronitrobenzene were absorbed under nonocclusive conditions.

These exposure data were compared with physiologic effects studied over a period of time. They found that no chronic intoxication occurred with the 3.6 mg/cu m exposure, although such changes as increased methemoglobin, the appearance of Heinz bodies, headache, vertigo, and a few cases of eczema were identified. Because skin absorption could not be determined with any degree of precision, the authors concluded that it was impossible to determine precisely whether an air concentration of 3.6 mg/cu m of PNCB or skin absorption caused the symptoms. The exposures at higher concentrations were apparently intermittent.",

Other concentrations were 0, 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 ppm (0, 9.6, 19 .2, 38.4, and 76.8 mg/mL) for 4-chloronitrobenzene.  In 2-week studies with 4-chloronitrobenzene, all rats and mice survived to the end of the studies. Body weight gains of exposed rats were similar to those of the controls ; body weight gains of exposed mice were greater than those of the controls . Liver and spleen weights were increased in exposed rats and mice . In rats, histopatholologic changes in the liver were limited to an increase in hemosiderin pigment in Kupffer cells . The spleens of exposed rats were congested and had increased hematopoietic activity and hemosiderin deposition. Kidneys of exposed male rats had lesions consistent with hyaline droplet nephropathy. The proximal convoluted tubules of exposed female rats contained hemosiderin. Microscopic changes in exposed mice primarily involved increased hematopoietic activity in the spleen and hemosiderin pigmentation in the spleen, liver, and proximal convoluted tubules in the kidney . In 13-week studies with 4-chloronitrobenzene, there were no deaths that were clearly related to exposure to 4-chloronitrobenzene . Body weight gains of exposed rats and mice were either equal to or greater than those of the controls . A more severe methemoglobinemia developed in rats exposed to 4-chloronitrobenzene than occurred in rats exposed to 2-chloronitrobenzene, and this methemoglobinemia resulted in a responsive macrocytic, hyperchromic anemia . Spleen weights were markedly greater in exposed rats and mice than in controls . In exposed rats, lesions in the spleen, liver, and kidney were similar to those described for the 2-week study . Additionally, increased hematopoietic cell proliferation in bone marrow, histiocytic hyperplasia in mediastinal lymph nodes, testicular atrophy, and chronic inflammation of the harderian gland occurred in exposed rats. In exposed mice, microscopic changes in the spleen and liver were similar to those noted in the 2-week study. Additional lesions included increased hematopoiesis and hemosiderin deposition in the bone marrow of exposed males and females and squamous cell hyperplasia of the forestomach epithelium in female mice .",

Percutaneous absorption of (14)C-2-chloronitrobenzene and (14)C-4-chloronitrobenzene was demonstrated in rats . For doses ranging from 0.65 to 65 mg/kg of either chemical, 33% to 40% of 2-chloronitrobenzene and 51% to 62% of 4-chloronitrobenzene were absorbed under nonocclusive conditions. Oral absorption was somewhat higher than dermal absorption for both chemicals, and metabolism was complicated, with over 20 unidentified metabolites isolated from urine of rats given either 2- or 4-chloronitrobenzene . 2-Chloronitrobenzene and 4-chloronitrobenzene were mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium with S9 activation . In addition, both compounds induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells ; requirements for S9 activation varied among testing laboratories . Neither compound induced sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster treated as adults or as larvae .",

It was administered via gavage. In the dose-range-finding study, all animals in the 640 mg/kg dose group died & animals in the 320 mg/kg group became cyanotic. Dose levels for Task 2 were set at 62.5, 125 & 250 mg/kg bw/day. Male & female mice were continuously exposed for a 7-day pre cohabitation & a 98-day cohabitation period (Task 2). Weights of pups delivered during the 98-day continuous breeding phase to dams in the 125 & 250 mg/kg groups were lower than controls. In the final litter of the continuous breeding phase, the proportion of pups born alive & the pup survival & weight gain during lactation were adversely affected at 250 mg/kg. Most of the 250 mg/kg bw group animals were cyanotic at the time of F1 mating. In the F1 mating, the proportion of F2 pups born alive & live F2 pup weights were significantly reduced in the 250 mg/kg 4CNB group. The average estrous cycle length in the F1 females was significantly increased. At terminal sacrifice, liver weight, & liver-to-body weight ratios were increased in both F1 sexes, & spleens were enlarged while body weights were unchanged. Thus, in the presence of cyanosis & increased liver weights, 4CNB decreased pup birth weights as well as postnatal survival & weight gain.",

Groups of 20, 24-hr old Daphnia magna Straus were exposed to 0.08 to 20 mg/L 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene in semi-static test vessels. Parent animals in the test and control vessels had to be pipetted 3 times/wk in freshly prepared test and control media at the corresponding concn level. The no observed effect concn (NOEC) was determined from the parameters of mortality of the parent animals, reproduction rate and appearance of the first offspring during the test period. In preliminary acute Daphnia tests, the 24 hr EC50 was 15 mg/l for 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene, the EC0 was 3.3 mg/L. The nominal 21 day no observed effect concn was 0.32 mg/L, with the most sensitive parameter being the reproductive rate.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.022 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 94 days. Weak absorption of UV light greater than 290 nm by 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene indicates potential for photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene is expected to have moderate mobility in soil based on an estimated Koc value of 310. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces may occur given a Henry's Law constant of 4.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Chloro-4-nitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Screening tests using activated sludge, suggest biodegradation of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene proceeds slowly in water and soil. If released into water, 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 152 hours and 73 days, respectively. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. BCF values of 5.8-20.9 measured in fish, suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 152 hours and 73 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), BCF values of 5.8-20.9 measured in fish(6), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Screening tests using activated sludge(6), suggest biodegradation of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene proceeds slowly in water. Weak absorption of UV light greater than 290 nm by 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene in methanol indicates potential for photolysis of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene in sunlit surface water(7).",

Vapor-phase 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 94 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.7X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Weak absorption of UV light greater than 290 nm by 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene in methanol indicates potential for photolysis by sunlight of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene in air(4).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 94 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 1-Chloro-4-nitrobenzene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Weak absorption of UV light greater than 290 nm by 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene in methanol indicates potential for photolysis by sunlight of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene in water and air(3). The irradiation of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene from 1 to 5 hours using a xenon arc lamp in air free from nitrogen oxides resulted in the formation of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol and 4-chlorophenol(4).",

The 2nd order, carbon normalized rate constants for solutions containing 80 uM 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene were recorded as 3.6X10-5 L/hr-mg C at pH 5.5, 3.6X10-4 L/hr-mg C at pH 7.2 and 1.1X10-3 L/hr-mg C at pH 8.6(1). The results from this study demonstrate that natural organic matter mediates the reduction of substituted nitroaromatic compounds in reducing environments. It is suggested that quinone-type species play a predominant role in natural organic matter mediated reductions of chloronitrobenzene(1). Quinoid-type compounds and iron porphyrins were shown to be effective mediators for the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds, including chloronitrobenzenes(2). Reaction conditions are homogeneous aqueous solutions (pH 6.8-7.0, 5 mM H2S) containing reduced sulfur species as bulk electron donors(2). Therefore, the reduction of chloronitrobenzenes in the environment may occur under reducing conditions in the presence of electron transfer mediators(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

This technique is particularly useful to study aromatic, conjugated, and other substances containing a pi bond.  Modern ultraviolet spectrophotometers also cover the visible light range, in which case the technique is called ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Groups of 12 male and 12 female rats were exposed to target vapor concentrations of 0, 30, 100, or 300 ppm (mean chamber vapor concentrations: 0, 31, 103, or 302 ppm, respectively) for 6 hours/day, 7 days/ week. Females received a total of 36 to 49 exposures (through Day 20 of gestation) and males received 49 exposures. No mortality was observed in the adults. Clinical signs of toxicity were observed during exposure, including partially closed eyes (high-exposure) and temporary reduction in activity (high- and mid-exposure). All exposed animals exhibited an increased incidence of porphyrin nasal discharge post-exposure, and 3 high-exposure males exhibited sialorrhea. A treatment-related decrease in feed consumption, with a corresponding decrease in body weight and body weight gain were observed during pre-mating in all exposed males and females. Females exposed to 103 and 302 ppm (mid- and high-exposure) continued to exhibit these trends in feed consumption and body weight gain during the first week of gestation. Mating was confirmed in 12/12 control females and 12/12 high-exposure females, while 11/12 confirmed matings were noted in the low- and mid-exposure females. High-exposure females exhibited a significant reduction in the number of litters produced (7/12; p<=0.05). A second mating between high-exposure males (receiving 42 exposures) and unexposed females resulted in 10/12 dams producing litters, which was comparable to controls. No treatment-related changes were noted upon necropsy in any exposed animals. Histological examination of the reproductive organs revealed no treatment-related lesions in any exposed animals, however examination of the nasal passages revealed chronic focal inflamation and focal metaplasia of the respiratory and olfactory epithelium, and sero-cellular exudates. Differences in the length of gestation, number of pups per litter, ratio of males to females and mean pup weights were considered biologically insignificant. The lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) based on feed consumption, body weights, body weight gain, and nasal passage histology was determined to be 31 ppm. The NOEL for reproductive toxicity under the test conditions was 103 ppm.",

Females received a total of 36 to 49 exposures (through Day 20 of gestation) and males received 49 exposures. No mortality was observed in the adults. Clinical signs of toxicity were not discussed. Mating, confirmed by the presence of a vaginal plug and/or the presence of sperm, was deemed successful in 12/12 control females and 12/12 high-exposure (300 ppm) females, while 11/12 confirmed matings were noted in the low- and mid-exposure females (30, and 100 ppm, respectively). The pregnancy index (number of litters delivered/number mated) for females exposed to 300 ppm was 7/12, or 58%. A second mating of high-exposure males (after 42 exposures) to unexposed females was conducted to further evaluate reproductive effects. As of this notification, the females of that second mating were in the third week of gestation. The males were euthanized on the day following the last exposure. Necropsy revealed no gross changes in the testes or epididymides or in testicular or epididymal weights. Histopathological evaluation was ongoing at the time this notice was filed.",

Negative control groups at each harvest time received corn oil only, while a positive control group received 40 mg cyclophosphamide/kg and were sacrificed at the 24 hour point only. Mortalities occurred in females receiving 680 mg/kg at the 24-hour harvest (1), the 48-hour harvest (2), and the 72-hour harvest (1) times. A statistically significant decrease in bone marrow was noted for male mice receiving 680 mg/kg of the test article. The test material did not induce a significant increase of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) at any dose level compared to concurrent negative controls.

Mesityl oxide's use as an insect repellent will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 8.21 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates mesityl oxide will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase mesityl oxide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-life for these reactions in air are estimated to be 4.9 hours and 1.4 hours, respectively. Mesityl oxide will also react with atmospheric nitrate with a half-life of 3.9 hours. Vapor-phase mesityl oxide undergoes direct photolysis with an experimental half-life and rate constant of 76.8 hrs and 8.75X10-3/hr, respectively. If released to soil, mesityl oxide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 15. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.67X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Mesityl oxide may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Theoretical %BOD values of 74 and 30 from studies done with sewage inoculum suggest that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, mesityl oxide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 17 hours and 11 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 1.9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to mesityl oxide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where mesityl oxide is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to mesityl oxide via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with insect repellents and other products containing mesityl oxide.

Volatilization of mesityl oxide from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.67X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 8.21 mm Hg(4), and water solubility(2). Mesityl oxide is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.67X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 8.21 mm Hg(4), and its water solubility(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 17 hours and 11 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 1.9(SRC), using a water solubility of 28,900 mg/L(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Theoretical %BOD values of 74(7) and 30(8) from studies done with sewage inoculum suggest that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase mesityl oxide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.9 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.86X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of mesityl oxide with ozone has been estimated as 2X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.4 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(4). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of mesityl oxide with nitrate has been estimated as 2.04X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(5). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3.9 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 2.4X10+8 nitrate molecules per cu cm(6).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that mesityl oxide is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 17 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 11 days(SRC). Mesityl oxide's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of mesityl oxide from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

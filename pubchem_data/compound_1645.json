ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), an inhibitor of PARP activity, in the development of acute pancreatitis caused by cerulein in mice. Intraperitoneal injection of cerulein in mice resulted in severe, acute pancreatitis characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration and necrosis and elevated serum levels of amylase and lipase. Infiltration of pancreatic and lung tissue with neutrophils (measured as increase in myeloperoxidase activity) was associated with enhanced expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and P-selectin. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated a marked increase in the staining (immunoreactivity) for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pancreas of cerulein-treated mice in comparison to sham-treated mice. Acute pancreatitis in vehicle-treated mice was also associated with a significant mortality (40% survival at 5 days after cerulein administration). In contrast, (1) the degree of pancreatic inflammation and tissue injury (histological score), (2) upregulation/formation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin, (4) neutrophils infiltration and (5) the expression of TGF-beta and VEGF was markedly reduced in pancreatic tissue obtained from cerulein-treated mice which have been treated with 3-AB. These findings provide the evidence that PARP inhibition reduces the degree of pancreas injury caused by acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein administration.",

The best studied of these enzymes (PARP-1) is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage so that in the event of irreparable DNA damage overactivation of PARP-1 leads to necrotic cell death. Inhibitors of PARP-1 activity in combination with DNA-binding antitumor drugs may constitute a suitable strategy in cancer chemotherapy. When DNA is moderately damaged, PARP-1 participates in the DNA repair process and the cell survives. However, in the case of extensive DNA damage PARP-1 overactivation induces a decrease of NAD+ and ATP levels leading to cell dysfunction or even to necrotic cell death. So, due to PARP-1 involvement in cell death, pharmacological inhibition of PARP-1 activity by PARP-1 inhibitors may constitute a suitable target to enhance the activity of antitumor drugs through inhibition of necrosis and activation of apoptosis. PARP-1 inhibitors such as 3-aminobenzamide, 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinolinone and the recently patented tryciclic benzimidazoles have shown potent inhibitory effects of PARP-1 activity in tumor cells.",

The aim of this study was to monitor the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of a fluorinated 3-ABA derivative in tumor-bearing rats by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To this end, 3-ABA was labeled with fluorine-19 by trifluoroethylation [3-amino-N-2,2,2-trifluoroethylbenzamide (3-ABA-TFE)], which only slightly increased the cytotoxicity of the compound as demonstrated by colony-forming assays. After intraperitoneal injection of 400 mg/kg BW 3-ABA-TFE to nine Copenhagen rats with Dunning prostate adenocarcinoma, (19)F MR images were acquired at a whole-body MR system with a spatial sampling of 10 x 10 x 15 mm(3). While 3-ABA-TFE was observed in all major organs and the muscular system, only a small and heterogeneous signal could be detected in the adenocarcinoma. Serial MR measurements yielded maximum tissue signals about 2 days after 3-ABA-TFE administration. At this time point, the mean muscle-to-liver and tumor-to-liver signal ratio was 0.31+/-0.07 and 0.11+/-0.04, respectively. Application of the (19)F MRI strategy makes it possible to measure the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of 3-ABA-TFE in individual animals in a longitudinal manner. The results obtained for the prostate adenocarcinoma indicate that delivery of 3-ABA-TFE to solid tumors may be seriously hampered by tumor-specific factors and that the intratumoral uptake of the substance may be lower than in normal tissues. Therefore, the development of effective carrier systems is mandatory to improve tumor-selective delivery.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In vitro studies showed that 3-aminobenzamide markedly reduced the NADPH-dependent covalent binding of [14C]dichlobenil and the hydroxylation of p-nitrophenol which have previously been suggested to be mediated by a common form of cytochrome P450 (P450) in rat olfactory microsomes ... . Furthermore, 3-aminobenzamide markedly reduced the P450-dependent metabolic activation of [3H]NNK (4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) in rat olfactory microsomes and slightly decreased the P450 2B1-dependent pentoxyresorufindealkylase activity in liver microsomes of phenobarbital-treated rats. The present results suggest that 3-aminobenzamide is also an inhibitor of P450 and that the lack of toxicity of dichlobenil in the olfactory mucosa of 3-aminobenzamide-treated mice is related to a decreased metabolic activation of dichlobenil at this site... .",

Cll lines deficient in poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis due to deficiency in the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PADPRP) or depletion of its substrate NAD+ overexpress GRP78. Furthermore, this overexpression of GRP78 is associated with the acquisition of resistance to topoisomerase II-directed drugs such as etoposide (VP-16) ...  Thus, /the/ studies suggest that interference with NAD+-PADPRP metabolism could provide an important approach to (a) define pathways of GRP78 induction, (b) study the effect of GRP78 on other cellular processes, (c) elucidate the mechanism of GRP78-dependent resistance to topoisomerase II targeted drugs, and (d) modulate responses to chemotherapy in normal and tumor tissues. However, in the in vivo situation, it is impractical to interfere with NAD+-PADPRP metabolism by mutational inactivation of PADPRP or by depletion of its substrate NAD+. Therefore, ...  several inhibitors of NAD+-PADPRP metabolism including 3-aminobenzamide, PD128763, and 6-aminonicotinamide /were examined/  for their ability to reproduce the results obtained with cell lines deficient in NAD+-PADPRP metabolism relative to the induction of GRP78 and subsequent development of resistance to VP-16. ...  6-aminoicotinamide treatment is highly effective in the induction of GRP78 and subsequent development of resistance to VP-16, whereas treatment with 3-aminobenzamide or PD128763 does not induce GRP78 and thus does not result in VP-16 resistance.",

Additive effects in SCE induction in vivo were observed when either Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells or P388 lymphocytic leukemia cells treated with CP were exposed to 3-AB in vivo. 3-AB enhanced the survival time of L1210 tumor bearing BDF1 mice treated with CP. However, the combined CP plus 3-AB treatment did not increase the survival of either EAT BALB/c- or P388 BDF1-tumor bearing mice compared with the effect on survival by CP alone. Therefore the in vivo differential antitumor effect, by CP in conjunction with 3-AB, appears to correlate well with the in vivo differential effect on cytogenetic damage caused by the combined CP plus 3-AB treatment. In the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian microsome test CP appears to have a dose dependent ability to induce base-pair substitutions in strains TA 100 and TA 1535 and frameshift mutations in strains TA 98 and TA 1537. Both types of mutation were synergistically increased in the presence of 3-AB.",

Repair replication was stimulated at least 10-fold by 3AB in both normal and ligase-deficient cells. Despite increased 3AB toxicity, repair replication in ligase I-deficient cells was unchanged from that in normal cells. This evidence is consistent with previous observations that the enhancement of repair replication by 3AB is not a direct function of DNA break frequencies.

The effect of 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) in gamma-irradiation induced damage and the subsequent repair of DNA along with the corresponding changes in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activity in lymphocytes of patients with cancer of breast and uterine cervix /was studied/. The presence or absence of 3AB prior to gamma-irradiation did not influence the extent of DNA damage. On the other hand, single strand break rejoining in breast cancer cases was found to be slower as compared to that of cervical cancer cases and normal individuals. The relative ADP-ribosylation in the presence of 3AB was much lower in the breast cancer cases as compared to normal but there was no significant change in the cervical cancer cases. Overall the maximum relative ADP-ribosylation was slower in the presence of 3AB. This suggests that the lower activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in breast cancer cases might delay the first phase of single strand breaks (SSBs) rejoining.",

A single intraperitoneal injection of 70 mg/kg MNU was administered to 15-day-old male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. In Experiment 1, rats were then subcutaneously injected with 1000 mg/kg nicotinamide either once or 3 times at 1-week intervals. In Experiment 2, rats were subcutaneously injected once with 50 mg/kg 3-aminobenzamide. For comparison, the following age-matched controls were included: MNU-untreated nicotinamide-injected rats, MNU-untreated 3-aminobenzamide-injected rats, and MNU-untreated PARP-inhibitor-untreated rats. Rats were examined for lens opacity. At 28 days after MNU injection, 10 to 20 rats per group were sacrificed. In Experiment 1, at 3 days after MNU injection, 10 rats per group were sacrificed for apoptosis and cell proliferation detection. MNU caused lens epithelial cell apoptosis in the germinative zone, as indicated by TUNEL staining. However, regardless of MNU treatment lens epithelial cell proliferation was consistently seen in the germinative zone and sporadically seen in the central zone. At 28 days after MNU, mature cataracts were observed.  Nicotinamide significantly accelerated lens opacity and cataractogenesis, as indicated by a cataract index.  3-Aminobenzamide significantly accelerated the development of lens opacity and tended to accelerate cataractogenesis. The PARP inhibitors nicotinamide and 3-aminobenzamide accelerated MNU-induced cataractogenesis.",

Animals were given BOP at a dose of 70 mg/kg body weight by sc injection and following a 2-week recovery period, were administered basal diet or basal diet containing 0.5, 0.75 and 1.5% ABA for 30 weeks. While the incidences of resultant pancreatic lesions, including hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma, induced by BOP were not significantly influenced by ABA treatment, the mean numbers of those pancreatic lesions were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent way. The results therefore suggested the possible involvement of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the post-initiation phase of pancreatic carcinogenesis in hamsters.",

Fischer 344 male rats were initiated with N-nitrosodiethylamine (200 mg/kg) and placed on either basal diet, diet containing 0.05% PB, diet containing various doses of the inhibitors alone or diet containing 0.05% PB plus various doses of inhibitors for 10 weeks, and then killed. Quantitation of the development of glutathione S-transferase placental form-positive foci revealed that ABA at doses of 2 and 1.5, but not 1%, significantly inhibited the PB promotion activity. Luminol dose-dependently reduced PB promotion at doses of 3 and 6% but exerted no effects at the 1 and 2% levels. MBA also demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory influence at doses of 1 and 2%.",

Protection by 3-aminobenzamide in the granulocyte system was apparently not mediated by an inhibition of nuclear poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. ... The unique effect of 3-aminobenzamide in this system appeared to relate to TPA-induced adhesion of the neutrophils to surfaces. In the presence of 1 mM 3-aminobenzamide, but not of benzamide, the adhesion of stimulated granulocytes to 3T3 monolayer cultures was markedly reduced or even abolished. This effect was also seen in granulocyte preparations depleted of monocytes. Since 3-aminobenzamide at the doses applied does not inhibit TPA-induced superoxide production in isolated granulocytes, its specific anticytotoxic effect appears to result from a dilution of granulocyte-derived damaging agents into the medium. ... Prevention of granulocyte adhesion is likely to reduce tissue damage and carcinogenesis in areas of chronic inflammation.",

The SVM line is also known to have a defect in the processing of DNA-strand breaks. Sister-chromatid exchange in other cells is known to be stimulated by the poly(ADP-ribose) transferase inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, which also retards DNA-break sealing. Sister-chromatid exchanges in SVM cells are found to be hypersensitive to 3-aminobenzamide, or to nicotinamide deprivation which similarly inhibits poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation; DNA-strand breaks are likewise induced by 3-aminobenzamide. Bromodeoxyuridine, needed to detect sister-chromatid exchanges, is more toxic to SVM cells and itself induces sister-chromatid exchanges to a greater extent than it does in normal muntjac cells. ... The mechanism by which BrdU exerts its effects can largely be explained in terms of familiar effects on deoxyribonucleotide pools and DNA integrity. 3-Aminobenzamide, however, induces sister-chromatid exchanges in SVM cells by another mechanism.",

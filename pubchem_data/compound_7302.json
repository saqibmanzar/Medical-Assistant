When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The investigators analyzed the blood and brain for gamma-butyrolactone and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, the chemical's primary metabolite, for a period of 60 minutes after administration. Blood levels of gamma-butyrolactone after oral administration were below the limit of detection of 18 ug/mL in 3 and 5 out of 6 animals, independently of the time of measurement, whereas the remaining animals had time-independent levels between 22.5 and 82.5 ug/mL. The levels observed for the primary metabolite, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, reached a peak value of 611 ug/mL at 15 minutes and were still 466 ug/mL at 60 minutes. Following ip and iv administration, there was also very rapid hydrolysis of gamma-butyrolactone to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid. The blood gamma-butyrolactone levels was 63 ug/mL 5 minutes after ip injection, while it was 22.5 ug/mL at 60 minutes; however, only 2 out of 6 animals had levels above the limit of detection at 60 minutes. Upon iv injection, the 5-minute value was 85 ug/mL, whereas gamma-butyrolactone was no longer detectable after 15 minutes. The concentration levels of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid seen after ip dosing dropped from a maximum of 694 ug/mL (5-minute value) 521 ug/mL at 60 minutes, whereas iv injection led to a maximum level of 550 ug/mL (15-minute value) which dropped to 430 ug/mL at 609 minutes. In brain, oral dosing resulted in maximum gamma-butyrolactone levels of 170 ug/g were found after 3 minutes, and time-independent gamma-butyrolactone levels of 14.8 to 29.1 ug/g were detected 15 to 60 minutes after dosing; the concentration of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid reached its peak of 191.6 ug/g after 30 minutes and fell to 129.1 ug/g at 60 minutes (no brain levels were measured after iv administration... .The data permit the conclusion that gamma-butyrolactone is very rapidly and apparently completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes very rapid metabolism to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid.",

Studies on the absorption of gamma-butyrolactone were carried out in at least 3, usually 4, male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 260 to 340 g; no precise details of the number of rats used)/dose and type of treatment. gamma-Butyrolactone (purity not specified) was administered orally by gastric intubation at dose levels of 1.58 and 6.34 mmol (approximately 136 and 546 mg)/kg bw, intracardially at 1.58 mmol or iv at 6.34 mmol/kg bw. Starting immediately after administration, the plasma was analyzed for gamma-butyrolactone over a total period of 3 to 8 hours. The analytical procedure did not distinguish between gamma-butyrolactone and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, the primary metabolite of gamma-butyrolactone, as earlier studies by the investigators had detected only gamma-hydroxybutyric acid in rat blood after administration of gamma-butyrolactone. When gamma-butyrolactone was given intracardially at 136 mg/kg bw, the plasma levels was 500 ug/mL immediately upon dosing, about 400 ug/mL after 30 minutes and slightly more than 100 ug/mL after 2 hours but then dropped to below 50 ug/mL after 2.5 hours. After oral administration of 136 mg/kg bw, plasma levels reached their peak of approximately 350 ug/mL at 15 to 30 minutes before declining with an elimination half-life of 0.3 hours to approximately 25 ug/mL within 3 hours. Plasma levels after oral administration of gamma-butyrolactone at 546 mg/kg bw remained at > or =1000 ug/mL for approximately 3 hours, as they did after iv administration of the same dose. Four hours after oral dosing, the plasma concentration was about 800 ug/mL, while it was approximately 450 ug/mL after 6 hours and slightly above 100 ug/mL after 8 hours. Subsequent to iv injection, plasma levels dropped somewhat more rapidly, reaching approximately 55 ug/mL after 8 hours (the graphical representation does not permit a more accurate reading). In percutaneous absorption studies, male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighting 275 to 525 g) had undiluted gamma-butyrolactone applied to the mechanically or mechanically and chemically depilated skin at 6.34 mmol (approximately 546 mg)/kg bw for 4 hours. The rate of percutaneous absorption depended on the method employed to pretreat the rat skin. When the skin was only shaved, the plasma concentrations rose slowly, reaching maximum levels of approximately 150 ug/mL after 1.5 to 2 hours; when the skin was shaved an subsequently treated with a commercial depilating agent (a thioglycolic acid-based formulation), the maximum plasma concentration of approximately 175 ug/mL was reached only approximately 10 minutes after gamma-butyrolactone application. Based on the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC values) it was found that, relative to the value obtained after iv administration, the fractions of dose absorbed were 85 and 98% upon oral administration, and 7 and 11% upon dermal application onto the mechanically or mechanically and chemically depilated skin, respectively.",

Lactonases have been identified in human blood and in the blood and liver of rats, but not in the rat brain, spleen, kidney, heart, diaphragm, lung skeletal muscle or gastrointestinal tract. The enzyme isolated from human plasma had a markedly higher activity than that isolated from rat liver microsomes. Moreover, conversion in human serum had a Km value of 2.7 x 10-2 M and thus was more efficient than in rat serum (Km value 1.6 x 10-2 M...). In vitro rat blood studies gave a half-life of less than one minute for the conversion of gamma-butyrolactone to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid. Hydrolysis took place in serum and plasma, hemolyzed erythrocytes being inactive. In rat plasma, hydrolysis was 92% after 15 minutes and 100% after 30 minutes, whereas in hemolyzed erythrocytes it was only 3% after 30 minutes. the percentage hydrolyzed in rat liver homogenate was 87% after 15 minutes and 94% after 60 minutes. In cat blood, hydrolysis of gamma-butyrolactone was slower than in rat blood. Samples of rabbit and guinea pig serum also showed hydrolysis of gamma-butyrolactone (no precise details). The various media were incubated with 1.3 x 10-2 M gamma-butyrolactone at 37 \u00b0C.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Bilateral intranigral injection of muscimol (2 ng/0.2 uL/side), a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist, significantly reduced the duration of EEG-recorded spike-and-wave discharges induced by gamma-butyrolactone (100 and 200 mg/kg ip), pentylenetetrazol (20 mg/kg ip) and THIP (7.5 mg/kg ip). This treatment had no effect on the electroencephalographic discharges observed after injection of THIP (10 mg/kg ip). Bilateral injection of muscimol (2 and 4 ng/side) into the substantia nigra did not modify the latency of onset nor the duration of clonic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol at the dose of 40 mg/kg ip. Bipolar depth electrode recording indicated that intranigral injection of muscimol did not alter nigral electroencephalographic activity. Autoradiography following intranigral injection of [3H]muscimol indicated a diffusion not exceeding 400 microns from the injection site. These results confirm that activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors in the substantia nigra suppresses the occurrence of spike-and-wave discharges in animal models of generalized non-convulsive epilepsy.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

These categories are not mutually exclusive and an abuser may use the drug illicitly to produce several effects. GHB is frequently taken with alcohol or other drugs that heighten its effects and is often found at bars, nightclubs, rave parties, and gyms. ... Gamma butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4-butanediol are GHB analogues that can be used as substitutes for GHB. When ingested, these analogues are converted to GHB and produce identical effects. GBL is also used in the clandestine production of GHB as an immediate precursor. Both GBL and 1,4-butanediol have been sold at health food stores and on various internet sites. ... Gamma butyrolactone (GBL) was made a /DEA/  List I Chemical in February 2000.",

Explosive limits specify the concentration range of a material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an ignition source. There are two types of explosive limits: lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL). The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering gamma-butyrolactone (>97% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex, 5 days/week for ... 2 years. 2 Year Studies: The doses administered to groups of 50 animals per sex were 0, 112, and 225 mg of gamma-butyrolactone per kg of body weight for male rats; 0, 225, and 450 mg/kg for female rats; and 0, 262, and 525 mg/kg for male and female mice. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2 yr gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of gamma-butyrolactone in male F344/N rats given 112 or 225 mg/kg or in female F344/N rats given 225 or 450 mg/kg in corn oil. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of gamma-butyrolactone in male B6C3F1 mice based on marginally increased incidences of adrenal medulla pheochromocytomas and hyperplasia in the low-dose group. The sensitivity of the study in male mice to detect a carcinogenic effect was reduced by the low survival of the high dose group associated with fighting. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of gamma-butyrolactone in female B6C3F1 mice given 262 or 525 mg/kg in corn oil.",

Butyrolactone is found naturally in coffee, raw earth almonds, chickpeas, mangos, and rambutan. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.45 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates butyrolactone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase butyrolactone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.9 days. Butyrolactone does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, butyrolactone is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 11. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.3X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, butyrolactone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc and high solubility. Butyrolactone reached 77% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using the Japanese MITI test, suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon butyrolactone's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Butyrolactone hydrolysis in neutral aqueous solutions proceeds slowly at room temperature and more rapidly at acidic conditions and elevated temperatures. Under alkaline conditions hydrolysis is rapid and irreversible. Occupational exposure to butyrolactone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where butyrolactone is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to butyrolactone via inhalation, ingestion of some foods, and ingestion of contaminated drinking water. Exposure among the general population may also occur through is use as a drug of abuse. (SRC)",

Volatilization of butyrolactone from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.3X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.45 mm Hg(4), and assigned value for water solubility of 1X10+6 mg/L (miscible)(5). Butyrolactone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.45 mm Hg(4). Butyrolactone, present at 100 mg/L, reached 77% of its theoretical biological oxygen demand in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test(6), suggesting that biodegradation in soil is an important environmental fate process(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.3X10-8 atm-cu m/mol(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.45 mm Hg(4), and assigned value for water solubility of 1X10+6 mg/L (miscible)(5). Hydrolysis in neutral aqueous solutions proceeds slowly at room temperature and more rapidly at acidic conditions and elevated temperatures; under alkaline conditions hydrolysis is rapid and irreversible(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3.2(SRC), from its log Kow of -0.64(2) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Butyrolactone reached 77% of its theoretical biological oxygen demand in 2 weeks using the Japanese MITI test(9), suggesting that biodegradation in water is an important environmental fate process(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

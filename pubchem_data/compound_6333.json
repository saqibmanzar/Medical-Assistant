Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Male Fischer 344 rats were dermally exposed (3.1-sq cm dorsal skin) to neat, one-third saturated, two-thirds saturated, or saturated aqueous solutions of 14 VOCs for 24 hr. Blood samples were obtained via indwelling jugular catheters during exposure (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hr), and analyzed for the VOCs by gas chromatography using headspace analysis. Absorption of the neat VOCs in this series of chemicals decreased as water solubility decreased. Peak blood levels of VOCs attained during exposure for 24 hr to neat chemicals were: 1,2-dichloroethane (135.1 ug/mL), bromochloromethane (113.3 ug/mL), chloroform (51.0 ug/mL), benzene (24.2 ug/mL), tetrachloroethylene (21.1 ug/mL), dibromomethane (18.2 ug/mL), trichloroethylene (11.6 ug/mL), toluene (9.5 ug/mL), xylene (8.8 ug/mL), hexane (8.0 ug/mL), ethylbenzene (5.6 ug/mL), styrene (5.3 ug/mL), carbon tetrachloride (5.0 ug/mL), and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (3.4 ug/mL). Blood levels of 1,2-dichloroethane and benzene continued to increase during the 24-hr exposure to neat chemical, while blood levels of the other neat VOCs peaked within 4 hr and then either decreased or remained about the same for the duration of the exposure. Absorption of VOCs from one-third, two-thirds, or saturated aqueous solutions was rapid, and resulted in depletion of the chemical from the solution although only a small amount of water was absorbed. Blood levels of each VOC were directly related to the exposure concentrations. The rapid appearance of VOCs in the blood from aqueous solutions demonstrates that detectable amounts of VOCs were absorbed during exposure of only about 1% of the skin surface area of the rat.",

Physiological modeling is a quantitative technique which may provide insight into the system being modeled and can be used for interspecies extrapolation. We developed a physiological model for the penetration of organic vapors through skin in vivo which allows the prediction of blood concentrations, after dermal vapor exposures in the rat, when chemical distribution coefficients, physiological and metabolic parameters, and skin permeability constants are known. We used the model in two distinct ways. First, permeability constants for dibromomethane (DBM), bromochloromethane (BCM), and methylene chloride (DCM) were calculated by using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for dihalomethanes to relate blood concentrations during dermal vapor exposures to the total amount of chemical which was absorbed through the skin. Second, a skin compartment was added to the model which had input based on the permeability-area-concentration product. This predictive model adequately described blood concentrations after DBM, BCM, and DCM dermal vapor exposures over a wide range of concentrations. This model could easily be modified for use with other organic vapors, and could be used to extrapolate to human vapor exposure conditions by substituting human physiological parameters for the animal values, providing permeability constants are known or can be determined.",

Exposures (DBM: 500 to 10,000 ppm; BCM: 2500 to 40,000 ppm) lasted 4 hr during which time five blood samples were drawn from jugular cannulae for analysis of the parent dihalomethane by gas chromatography. Estimates of the amounts of chemicals stored in tissues and exhaled were based on concentrations in the blood and tissue partition coefficients, tissue volumes, and ventilation rate. Total metabolism was estimated from the amount of bromide released during the 4-hr exposure. The total amount of vapor absorbed through the skin was calculated from the estimates of the amount of parent chemical in blood and tissues, and the amounts exhaled and metabolized. The dermal flux for each concentration (DBM: 0.004 to 0.078 mg/sq cm/hr; BCM: 0.011 to 0.164 mg/sq cm/hr) was calculated by dividing the amount absorbed by exposed surface area and duration of exposure. Flux was divided by exposure concentration to calculate a permeability constant. With each dihalomethane the permeability constants (DBM: congruent to 1.12 cm/hr; BCM: congruent to 0.79 cm/hr) were essentially independent of exposure concentration. This study shows that a whole-body dermal vapor exposure in rodents is technically possible, and quantitation of penetration can be accomplished using calculations based on achieved blood concentrations and some measure of metabolism.",

The two different metabolic hypotheses examined are (1) a two-pathway model using both CYP2E1 and glutathione transferase enzymes and (2) a two-binding site model where metabolism can occur on one enzyme, CYP2E1. Our computer simulations show that both hypotheses describe the experimental data in a similar manner. The two pathway results were comparable to previously reported values (V(max)=3.8 mg/hr, K(m)=0.35 mg/L, and k(GST)=4.7 /hr). The two binding site results were V(max(1))=3.7 mg/hr, K(m(1))=0.3 mg/hr, CL(2)=0.047 L/hr.

We have developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PB-PK) model which describes the kinetics of CO, carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), and parent dihalomethane, and have applied this model to examine the inhalation kinetics of CO and of DCM in rats and humans. The portion of the model describing CO and HbCO kinetics was adapted from the Coburn-Forster-Kane equation, after modification to include production of CO by DCM oxidation. DCM kinetics and metabolism were described by a generic PB-PK model for volatile chemicals ... Physiological and biochemical constants for CO were first estimated by exposing rats to 200 ppm CO for 2 hr and examining the time course of HbCO after cessation of CO exposure. These CO inhalation studies provided estimates of CO diffusing capacity under free breathing and for the Haldane coefficient, the relative equilibrium distribution ratio for hemoglobin between CO and O2. The CO model was then coupled to a PB-PK model for DCM to predict HbCO time course behavior during and after DCM exposures in rats. By coupling the models it was possible to estimate the yield of CO from oxidation of DCM. In rats only about 0.7 mol of CO are produced from 1 mol of DCM during oxidation. The combined model adequately represented HbCO and DCM behavior following 4-hr exposures to 200 or 1000 ppm DCM, and HbCO behavior following 1/2-hr exposure to 5160 ppm DCM or 5000 ppm bromochloromethane. The rat PB-PK model was scaled to predict DCM, HbCO, and CO kinetics in humans exposed either to DCM or to CO. Three human data sets from the literature were examined: (1) inhalation of CO at 50, 100, 250, and 500 ppm; (2) seven 1/2-hr inhalation exposures to 50, 100, 250, and 500 ppm DCM; and (3) 2-hr inhalation exposures to 986 ppm DCM. An additional data set from human volunteers exposed to 100 or 350 ppm DCM for 6 hr is reported here for the first time. Endogenous CO production rates and the initial amount of CO in the blood compartment were varied in each study as necessary to give the baseline HbCO value, which varied from less than 0.5% to greater than 2% HbCO. The combined PB-PK model gave a good representation of the observed behavior in all four human studies.",

A closed recirculated exposure system was used to collect a series of uptake curves for each chemical at a range of initial concentrations. The shapes of these curves were a function of the tissue partition coefficients and the kinetic characteristics of the metabolism of these chemicals. Tissue:air partition coefficients were experimentally determined for each chemical and incorporated into a physiological kinetic model which was then used to simulate the uptake process. An optimal fit of the family of uptake curves for each chemical was obtained by adjusting the biochemical constants for metabolism of the chemical. Metabolism of both 1,1-DCE and CCl4 was represented by a single saturable process while MC required only a first-order pathway. BCM and DE exhibited a combination of both a saturable and a first-order process. Pyrazole, which blocks oxidative microsomal metabolism, inhibited the saturable pathways of 1,1-DCE, BCM, DE, and CCl4 metabolism and abolished the first-order pathway for MC. The maximum velocity of metabolism for the saturable pathway with 1,1-DCE, BCM, DE, and CCl4 for a 225-g rat was 27.2, 19.9, 26.1, and 0.92 mol/hr, respectively. The simulation approach for analyzing gas uptake data distinguishes between single and multiple metabolic pathways and provides kinetic constants that can be used in predictive toxicokinetic models for describing constant concentration inhalation exposure as well as exposures by other routes of administration.",

Pretreatment of rats with isoniazid, 4 x 0.36 mmol/kg i.p., produced significant enhancements of the COHb formation; the values were 18.0 +/- 0.8% COHb after DCM, 24.1 +/- 0.8% COHb after BCM, and 39.0 +/- 1.3% COHb after DBM. Prior administration of phenobarbital, 4 x 0.31 mmol/kg i.p., caused no appreciable alterations in the COHb levels after DCM and slight but significant increases after BCM as well as after DBM. The data indicate that the oxidative metabolism of dihalomethanes to carbon monoxide is mainly catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 IIE1 and that the DCM-evoked COHb formation seems to be a method of testing whether a chemical is an inducer of this form of cytochrome P-450 in vivo.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Protein synthesis by rat liver slices was evaluated by [3H]leucine incorporation into the trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-insoluble material, and lipid peroxidation was evaluated by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) released into the incubation medium. Protein synthesis inhibition by bromotrichloromethane (BrCCl3) or t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) depended on the incubation time and oxidant concentration. [(3)H]Leucine incorporation was decreased to 20 and 47% of control values and TBARS were enhanced from the control value of 16.9 to 45.3 and 62.5 nmol/g of liver by incubation for 1 hr with 1 mM BrCCl3 and t-BOOH, respectively. Following incubation, both protein synthesis damage and lipid peroxidation were decreased in control and oxidant-treated slices prepared from rats injected with 200 mg of DL-alpha-tocopherol/kg of body wt. Release of lactate dehydrogenase was not enhanced by oxidant treatment. Protein synthesis inhibitors reversibly decreased [(3)H]leucine incorporation, but the effect of oxidants on protein synthesis was irreversible. Cumene hydroperoxide and methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, but not hydrogen peroxide, damaged protein synthesis and induced lipid peroxidation. The ability of carbon tetrabromide, benzyl chloride, bromoform, bromobenzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, dichloromethane, and bromochloromethane to inhibit protein synthesis was correlated with their ability to induce lipid peroxidation, and with their LD50. The results suggest that oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation and protein synthesis damage occurred concurrently, and that protein synthesis inhibition may be involved in cell injury or death mediated by free radicals.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The major use of chlorobromomethane is as fire-extinguishing fluid, particularly for aircraft and portable systems. It is also used as an explosion suppression agent, as a solvent, and as an intermediate in the manufacture of some insecticides (chlormephos). HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Symptoms of exposure to chlorobromomethane include disorientation; dizziness; irritation of the skin, eyes and throat; pulmonary edema; headache; anorexia; nausea; vomiting; abdominal pain; weight loss; memory impairment; paralysis; weakness; tremors; convulsions; and CNS depression. It may cause coughing, chest pain, and difficulty in breathing. It may also cause transient corneal epithelium damage. The compound is extremely destructive to tissue of the mucous membranes, upper respiratory tract, eyes, and skin. One firefighter's cornea was injured when a fire extinguisher containing chlorobromomethane and dichlorodifluoromethane was discharged close to his face. Soon thereafter partial loss of corneal epithelium was observed, but deeper layers of cornea remained clear. ANIMAL STUDIES:  Exposure of rabbit eyes to a spray of liquid from fire extinguisher containing a mixture of 75% chlorobromomethane plus 25% dichlorodifluoromethane caused transient corneal epithelial injury and conjunctival edema. When applied repeatedly to open skin of rabbits, chlorobromomethane resulted in some hyperemia and exfoliation. When bandaged on, it produced moderate irritation and hyperemia. Concentrations as low as 3000 ppm produced light narcosis in rats. Transient pulmonary edema was observed at concentrations below 27,000 ppm. At higher concentrations, interstitial pneumonitis resulted in delayed deaths. Delayed deaths were also observed after exposure to 20,000 ppm. Deaths during exposure occurred only from exposures above 27,000 ppm. In dogs, acute exposures to high concentrations produced agitation, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial sensitization to epinephrine, and epileptiform convulsions within 12 min. Chlorobromomethane was mutagenic toward Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1535 which contains rat glutathione S-transferase 5-5. Reverse mutations were observed at the tyr locus in Escherichia coli WU361089 exposed at 10 uL/plate without activation. Prophage induction was also observed in E. coli K394 exposed without activation at 10 uL/plate. In an in vitro test with FAF-cells of Chinese hamsters, the compound produced an increase of the sister chromatid exchange frequency.",

Liver disease: Although chlorobromomethane is not known as a liver toxin in humans, the importance of this organ in the biotransformation and detoxification of foreign substances should be considered before exposing persons with impaired liver function. Kidney disease: Although chlorobromomethane is not known as a kidney toxin in humans, the importance of this organ in the elimination of toxic substances justifies special consideration in those with impaired renal function. Chronic respiratory disease: In persons with impaired pulmonary function, especially those with obstructive airway disease, the breathing of chlorobromomethane might cause exacerbation of symptoms due to its irritant properties. 2.

Male and female rats were exposed for 7 hours at 5,000 ppm of the test substance, 1, 1.5, 2, 4 and 6 hours at 10,000 ppm, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 hours at 20,000 ppm, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6 hours at 40,000 ppm and at 80,000 ppm of the test substance for 0.1 and 0.2 hours. The animals were observed during exposure and until death occurred or until consciousness was regained. The rats were weighed before exposure, the day following exposure and at intervals for two weeks thereafter or until it was apparent that all animals had recovered and were gaining weight normally. No mortality was observed in the 5,000 ppm exposed group. The minimum exposures causing essentially mortality were 2 hours at 10,000 ppm, 0.5 hours at 20,000 ppm, 0.2 hours at >/= 40,000 ppm. Drowsiness was apparent in rats exposed for 7.0 hours to 5,000 ppm. Rats exposed to 10,000 ppm were very drowsy after 1.5 hours and unconscious after two hours. Rats exposed to 20,000 ppm were unconscious at the end of 15 minutes exposure and those exposed to 40,000 ppm were unconscious after six minutes of exposure. With few exceptions, rats that recovered consciousness quickly regained any loss of body weight. On the basis of these results, the inhalative LC0 for bromochloromethane was determined to be 5,000 ppm (26458.81 mg/cu m) after 7-hour exposure period and 10,000 ppm (52917.63 mg/cu m) was determined to be the LC100 for bromochloromethane after 6 hours of inhalation exposure.",

Several species of marine algae and possibly diatoms naturally release bromochloromethane to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 142 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bromochloromethane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase bromochloromethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 108 days. Bromochloromethane does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, bromochloromethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 22. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.46X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Bromochloromethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, bromochloromethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process with an estimated half-life greater than 2.3X10+5 years under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to bromochloromethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bromochloromethane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to bromochloromethane via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of drinking water and use of fire extinguishers containing this compound.

Vapor-phase bromochloromethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 108 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.80X10-14 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The atmospheric lifetime is further reduced by ocean removal(4). On the basis of its water solubility and assuming that dissolution in the ocean leads to chemical degradation, the atmospheric lifetime will be reduced by approximately a factor of 2(4). Bromochloromethane does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 108 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). A rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of bromochloromethane with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals has also been reported at 1.11X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3), corresponding to an atmospheric half-life of 145 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). Bromochloromethane ozone depletion potential has been reported as 0.16(4). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 9.4X10-8 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(2); this corresponds to half-lives of 2.3X10-6 yrs and 2.3X10-5 yrs at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(2). Measurement of bromochloromethane reaction kinetics as a function of pH and temperature indicate that HS- promoted (bisulfide ion produced by microbial reduction of sulfate) reaction exceed hydrolysis rates at HS- concentrations greater than 2-17 uM, well within ranges common in sulfate-reducing environments(5). Therefore, abiotic reaction with bisulfide ions may be of considerable importance in sufate-reducing environments. Bromochloromethane does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

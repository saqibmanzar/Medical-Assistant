This process causes an inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis and de novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, resulting in cell growth arrest and cell death.  It is often combined with erythromycin to treat acute otitis media caused by the bacteria, haemophilus influenzae.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

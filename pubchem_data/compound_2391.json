When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Sodium ions, potassium ions, and water passively leave the cell; while sodium and chloride ions are unable to be reabsorbed.  Water is also be transported from the luminal side of cells into the vasculature by aquaporin 3. Bisacodyl decreases expression of aquaporin 3, preventing water from moving into the vasculature, which may contribute to increased water in the colon.

Inhibition of gastric motility by cathartics does not appear to be due to an effect on adrenergic or cholinergic pathways but rather involves a purinergic mechanism.",

In order to clarify the relationship between the bisacodyl-associated urinary bladder calculi and the development of proliferative lesions in the urinary bladder, male and female rats were administered bisacodyl-diets at concentrations of 0.3, 0.1, and 0.03% for 32 wk. Both sexes of animals treated with bisacodyl suffered from diarrhea throughout the experimental period. Epithelial proliferative lesions and calculus formation were observed only in the urinary bladder of male rats given the 0.3% bisacodyl diet. Proliferative lesions and increases of bromouracil deoxyriboside (BUdR) labeling indices were found only in the urinary bladder epithelium of rats with calculi, the severity of the former correlating with the calculus weight ...",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.8X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bisacodyl will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase bisacodyl will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Bisacodyl does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therfore would not be expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, bisacodyl is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 85,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.3X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. Bisacodyl is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, bisacodyl is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 78 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 2.3 L/mole-sec was estimated using a structure estimation method; this corresponds to half-lives of 35 and 3.5 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to bisacodyl may occur through inhalation of particles and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bisacodyl is produced or used. Exposure to the drug among the general population may be limited to those administered bisacodyl (a laxative). (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

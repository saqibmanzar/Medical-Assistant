PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The thiiranes of greatest interest to industry are ethylene, propylene and chloropropylene sulfides. They may be prepared by interaction of the appropriate epoxide with potassium thiocyanate. A critical estimation of the vapor toxicities of these compounds was undertaken, utilizing dynamic gassing equipment and larger groups of rats in eposure periods of 1 and 6 hr. Rats exposed to the 3 episulfides showed marked similarities in the lesions found in tissues. In the lungs, congestion ranging from slight to severe was a common finding. Edema and slight to moderate hemorrhage were seen. A moderate to severe degree of cuffing was noted. A few instances of pneumonia and bronchitis were recorded. Degenerative changes in the trachea were slight or absent. No striking alterations were noted in the heart or liver. Kidney changes afforded some evidence of a difference in the action of chloropropylene sulfide as compared with the non-halogenated episulfides. Protein casts were seen in the cortex and the medullary region, with degeneration and necrosis, in animals exposed to chloropropylene sulfide; these changes were not conspicuous in rats exposed to ethylene and propylene sulfides. Ethylene and propylene sulfides are of about equal toxicity when administered as vapors by the respiratory route in 1 hr and 6 hr acute exposures. Chloropropylene sulfide is approximately twice as toxic as the non-halogenated episulfides under these conditions. A consistent departure from Haber's rule (Ct = constant) is evident for all 3 episulfides when the results from the 2 exposure duration are compared.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 250 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C ethylene sulfide will exist solely as a vapor phase in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethylene sulfide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 days. Ethylene sulfide does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethylene sulfide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 26. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Ethylene sulfide may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, ethylene sulfide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound has a functional group that hydrolyzes under environmental conditions. Ethylene oxide hydrolyzes slowly in fresh and salt water; by analogy ethylene sulfide may act similarly. The half-life for this reaction is 12-14 days for pH's between 5-7 in fresh water and 9-11 days in salt water.  Occupational exposure to ethylene sulfide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethylene sulfide was produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ethylene sulfide via ingestion of food. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole, developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 0.81(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Ethylene oxide hydrolyzes slowly in fresh and salt water(8); by analogy ethylene sulfide may act similarly(SRC). The half-life for this reaction is 12-14 days for pH's between 5-7 in fresh water and 9-11 days in salt water(8-10). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2008).",

Vapor-phase ethylene sulfide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 days (SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.0X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C, that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Ethylene sulfide does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

It may be used to diagnose pheochromocytoma by the phentolamine-blocking test.  Submucosal injection of phentolamine is indicated for the reversal of soft-tissue anesthesia (e.g. anesthesia of the lip and tongue) and the associated functional deficits resulting from an intraoral submucosal injection of a local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor in patients three years old and older.

The phentolamine test may be used when additional confirmatory evidence of pheochromocytoma is required and the potential benefits of the test outweigh the possible risks. The phentolamine test is more reliable in detecting pheochromocytomas in patients with sustained hypertension than in those with paroxysmal hypertension and is of no value in patients who are not hypertensive at the time of the test. Sudden and marked reduction in blood pressure following parenteral administration of phentolamine to a hypertensive patient suggests the presence of a pheochromocytoma. However, false-negative and false-positive responses to the phentolamine test occur frequently. /Use included in US product label/",

Other complications of intracavernous injection of combined phentolamine and papaverine have included transient pain, including referred pain to the glans, burning, and paresthesia. Penile ecchymosis has occurred in many patients, and superficial hematoma and bruising of the penis also have occurred. Fibrotic changes (e.g., induration, lumpy areas of the penis but not necessarily at the injection site), including bilateral fibrosis of the corpora cavernosa, also have been reported. Embolus in the glans has been reported rarely, and the development of priapism, deep vein thrombosis, and fatal pulmonary embolus occurred in one patient. Adverse systemic effects of the drugs (e.g., facial flushing, dizziness, decreased systemic blood pressure, metallic taste) also have occurred.",

Phentolamine induces vasodilatation of vascular smooth muscle and pupils. When used in an ophthalmic solution, the onset of pupil dilation generally occurred in 30 minutes, with the maximal effect seen in 60 to 90 minutes. Pupil dilation lasted for at least 24 hours. Phentolamine also has direct but less marked positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on cardiac muscle and vasodilator effects on vascular smooth muscle; however, phentolamine is not believed to affect contractile or adenyl cyclase function. Large doses can lead to a mild sympatholytic action.   Some evidence suggests that phentolamine also stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors, thereby causing peripheral vasodilation. Phentolamine was shown to stimulate insulin secretion, possibly related to its blocking actions on ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels.",

Phentolamine has greater a-adrenergic blocking effects than does tolazoline. Phentolamine is more effective in antagonizing responses to circulating epinephrine and/or norepinephrine than in antagonizing responses to mediator released at the adrenergic nerve ending. The drug causes peripheral vasodilation and decreases peripheral resistance, primarily by direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, but a-adrenergic blockade also contributes to vasodilation. Phentolamine also stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors and produces a positive inotropic and chronotropic effect on the heart and increases cardiac output.",

Because phentolamine mesylate had not been approved previously for submucosal administration, 2 Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) studies in dogs designed to investigate systemic toxicity and the local effects of single and repeated dosing of OraVerse on the inferior alveolar nerve and branches of the superior alveolar nerve and adjacent soft tissues after local administration were conducted. Systemic toxicity was measured by preinjection and postinjection clinical examinations, clinical chemistry, and gross and microscopic examinations of major organs after necropsy. No evidence of systemic toxicity was detected. Local nerve and adjacent tissue damage was assessed by conventional histopathology. Nerve degeneration was evident in 1 animal. Mild perineural inflammation adjacent to the inferior alveolar nerve and inflammatory exudates were observed in submucosal tissues in several animals. No changes were observed in the nerves at injection sites of dogs from any dose group that were considered directly related to the test articles.",

This study used pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbits (n=7), in which the following parameters were measured: mean arterial pressure, carotid blood flow, heart rate, intraocular pressure (IOP), orbital venous pressure (OVP), ciliary blood flow, and aqueous flow (AqFlow). Measurements were made before and after an intravenous administration of phentolamine (0.1 mg/kg). Phentolamine caused significant decreases in IOP -23%+/-2%; P<0.01), OVP (-28%+/-12%; P<0.05), and AqFlow (-33%+/-6%; P<0.01). The other parameters were not significantly altered. The rapidity of the OVP and IOP responses were noteworthy, being essentially complete 60 s after the phentolamine injection. A subpressor dose of phentolamine has complex effects on ocular hydrodynamics. The initial IOP decrease is too fast to be explained by aqueous dynamics or ocular rigidity, and so is most likely a result of the disgorgement of choroidal blood volume caused by decreased venous pressure outside the eye. The more prolonged ocular hypotensive effect is explained by the decrease in AqFlow, and perhaps a decrease in episcleral venous pressure or increase in uveoscleral outflow. However, the inhibition of aqueous production is odd, as lost prejunctional inhibition of norepinephrine release and unopposed beta-receptor activation should have increased aqueous production.",

Phentolamine mesylate was administered to rats by oral gavage at daily doses of 10, 50, and 150 mg/kg for 24 months. A dose-related increase in mortality, ascribed to an exaggerated pharmacologic effect, was seen at high doses. Systemic exposure as measured by plasma drug concentration increased with dose and duration of dosing and slight drug accumulation occurred, particularly in high-dose males. In the treated groups, 10 males and 1 female were diagnosed with hibernomas, neoplasms of brown adipose tissue, which appeared in the thoracic cavity or retroperitoneal area as circumscribed, tan to reddish-brown lobulated masses. Histologically, the masses were well circumscribed with variably sized lobules defined by a rich capillary network and consisted of closely apposed oval to polygonal cells with large amounts of cytoplasm and a centrally located nucleus. The cytoplasm's appearance varied from multivacuolated to univacuolated to granular eosinophilic. In a few cases, neoplastic emboli were observed in capsular vessels. Ultrastructurally, the neoplastic cells contained numerous mitochondria with transverse parallel cristae that occupied over 60% of the cytoplasm and lipid droplets.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

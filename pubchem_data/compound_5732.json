It is available in both immediate acting and extended release forms,.   Its tolerability profile is favorable when administered according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, with a low risk of drug withdrawal, drug dependence, and drug tolerance. In addition, zolpidem improves sleep quality in patients suffering from chronic insomnia and can show mild muscle relaxant properties. Research also shows that zolpidem is rapid and effective in restoring brain function for patients in a vegetative state following brain injury. This drug has the propensity to completely or partially reverse the abnormal metabolism of damaged brain cells after injury,.",

It works quickly (usually within 15 minutes) and has a short half-life (two to three hours). Zolpidem has not adequately demonstrated effectiveness in maintaining sleep (unless delivered in a controlled-release form); however, it is effective in initiating sleep. Some users take zolpidem recreationally for these side effects. However, it may be less common than benzodiazepine abuse. Zolpidem can become addictive if taken for extended periods of time, due to dependence on its ability to put one to sleep or to the euphoria it can sometimes produce.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Due to the above effects, the FDA has recommended an initial dose of zolpidem (immediate-acting) is a single dose of 5 mg for women and a single dose of 5 or 10 mg for men, immediately before bedtime with at least 7-8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. Refer to product labeling for detailed information,.   **Effects on memory**  Controlled studies in adults using objective measures of memory demonstrated no significant evidence of next-day memory impairment after the administration of zolpidem. On the contrary, in a clinical study involving the administration of zolpidem doses of 10 and 20 mg, a  marked reduction in a next-morning recall of information relayed to subjects during peak drug effect (90 minutes after dosing) was observed. These subjects experienced a condition known as _anterograde amnesia_. Subjective evidence from adverse event data has suggested that anterograde amnesia may occur after zolpidem administration, mainly at doses above 10 mg.  **Effects on psychomotor function**  This drug may cause decreased psychomotor performance. Additive psychomotor effects may occur with other drugs that cause depression of psychomotor function, including alcohol. Patients taking zolpidem should be cautioned against participating in hazardous activities or occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination, including operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after ingesting the drug. Potential impairment of the performance of the above types of activities may also occur the day after zolpidem ingestion, especially at higher doses and ingestion of the extended-release form,.   **Effects on insomnia and sleep stages**  Evidence suggests that this drug is associated with minimal rebound insomnia. During clinical trials with patients using zolpidem on an \u2018as-needed\u2019 basis, zolpidem use resulted in global improvements in sleep. Zolpidem has been demonstrated to decrease sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) for up to 35 days in controlled clinical studies. In studies measuring the percentage of sleep time spent in each sleep stage, zolpidem has primarily been shown to preserve sleep stages. Sleep time spent in stages 3 and 4 (deep sleep) was measured as similar to placebo with only minor and inconsistent changes in REM (paradoxical) sleep at the recommended dose.  **Next-day residual effects**   In 2013, the FDA issued a statement warning that patients who take zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR)\u2015either 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg\u2015should not drive or participate in other activities requiring full mental alertness the day after taking the drug, due to the fact that zolpidem concentrations can remain increased the next day, and impair the ability to perform these activities,.  Patients may decrease their risk of next-morning impairment by taking the lowest dose of their insomnia medicine that treats their symptoms, according to the FDA. Specific dosing recommendations for both men and women are included in this statement. This information is also available on product labeling,.   **Rebound effects**   There was no polysomnographic (objective) evidence of rebound insomnia at normal doses,  in studies evaluating sleep on the nights following discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate. Subjective evidence of impaired sleep in the elderly on the first post-treatment night was observed at doses higher than the recommended 5mg dose for elderly patients.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

                        "Description": "In medicine, the term \"mechanism of action\" (also called MOA) is used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It interacts with a _GABA-BZ_ receptor complex and shares various pharmacological properties with the _benzodiazepine_ class of drugs.  Subunit binding of the _GABAA_ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is thought to lead to the sedative, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and myorelaxant drug effects of zolpidem. The main regulatory site of the GABAA receptor complex can be found on its _alpha (\u03b1) subunit_ and is called the _benzodiazepine_ (BZ) or _omega (\u03c9)_ receptor. At least three different subtypes of the (\u03c9) receptor have been identified to this date.  In contrast to benzodiazepine drugs, which are found to modulate all benzodiazepine receptor subtypes in a non-selective fashion, zolpidem binds the (BZ1) receptor specifically with a potent affinity for the alpha 1/alpha 5 subunits (in vitro).   More recent studies suggest that zolpidem binds primarily to the alpha 1, 2, and 3 subunits of the GABA receptor,,, and not the alpha 5 subunit.   The (_BZ1_) receptor is found primarily on the Lamina IV of the brain sensorimotor cortical regions, substantia nigra (pars reticulata), cerebellum molecular layer, olfactory bulb, ventral thalamic complex, pons, inferior colliculus, and globus pallidus. Specific and selective binding of zolpidem on the (BZ1) receptor is not considered absolute, however, this binding could potentially explain the relative lack of myorelaxant and anticonvulsant activity in animal studies in addition to the preservation of deep sleep (stages 3 and 4) in human studies of zolpidem at hypnotic doses.",

A single instance of clinically apparent liver injury has been reported. The onset of injury was 2 days after a single dose of zolpidem and was accompanied by abdominal pain, but no jaundice. The pattern of liver enzyme elevations was hepatocellular and the abnormalities were self-limited, although they seemed to recur on reexposure. Zolpidem is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system (predominantly CYP 3A4) and can cause drug-drug interactions, although such interactions are rare. Thus, zolpidem has not been linked to cases of liver injury with jaundice, but rarely may cause transient, mild-to-moderate serum enzyme elevations with or without symptoms.",

HBRAs are not benzodiazepines, but they work in a similar way. Some brand names of zolpidem are Ambien\u00ae, Edluar\u00ae, Intermezzo\u00ae, and Zolpimist\u00ae.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Some people who stop taking zolpidem suddenly may have withdrawal symptoms that can include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, flushing, lightheadedness, crying, and nervousness. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about this medication, the benefits of treating insomnia, and the risks of untreated insomnia during pregnancy.",

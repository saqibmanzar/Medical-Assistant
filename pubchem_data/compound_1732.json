When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Muscle from 15 MHS patients responded to 4-cmc with increasing force at a threshold concentration of 75 umol/L or less, whereas muscle from 23 MH-non-susceptible (MHN) patients had thresholds of 100 umol/L or more. The accuracy of the chlorocresol test was thus 100% (95% confidence limits 90.75-100%) at a threshold of 75 umol/L. Amplitude of contractures at 2 mmol/L caffeine was not different from contractures at 75 umol/L of 4-cmc in either the MHS or the MHN group (P>0.05). In vivo concentrations of chlorocresol from clinical use of insulin and somatropin are estimated to be 20 times less than the threshold concentration and thus these drugs seem safe in MH patients. 4-chloro-m-cresol may be a suitable aid to clarify puzzling results of standard testing of MH susceptibility.",

Occlusive patches of 0.2 mL of a 5% PCMC aqueous suspension stabilized with Carbomer 941, a saturated aqueous solution of 0.38% PCMC, 5% PCMC in olive oil/acetone (4:1), or 5% PCMC in propylene glycol were applied for 24 hr. After 96 hr, the animals were killed and the skin at the site of patch testing was removed for analysis (the patches were kept for analysis to determine the amount of PCMC remaining in the patch material). Fractional sampling of the urine and feces was performed to determine the rate of absorption of PCMC. An additional three animals had been injected with PCMC intraperitoneally to determine the excretion rate. However, no free PCMC was found, indicating rapid metabolism.  In determining bioavailability, the calculations were based on the assumption that the saturated PCMC solution is 0.4% (w/v), corresponding to 0.8 mg in 0.2 mL, and that 0.2 mL of the 5% PCMC preparations contained 10 mg of the chemical. The results indicated that 25% of the aqueous PCMC (stabilized with carbomer 941) and 46% of the saturated aqueous PCMC solution remained in the patches. Only 0.2% of the aqueous PCMC (stabilized with carbomer 941) and 0.5% of the saturated aqueous PCMC solution was found in the skin at the patch site. This was compared to 65% of the PCMC in propylene glycol and 66% of the PCMC in olive oil/acetone solutions remaining in the patch; and 0.7% and 1.6%, respectively found in the skin at the patch site. The authors conclude that PCMC was more bioavailable from the aqueous preparations. After 96 hr, 0.2 and 0.5% PCMC was detected at the patch test site in the animals dosed with 5% and saturated aqueous PCMC, respectively, and 0.7 and 1.6% PCMC were found in the skin of the animals patch tested with 5% PCMC in olive oil/acetone and propylene glycol, respectively.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In cerebellar microsomes, this compound released Ca2+ from an inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-insensitive store, suggesting that there too it was acting at the ryanodine receptor level. When tested on PC12 cells, chlorocresol released Ca2+ from a caffeine- and thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular store. In addition, the compound was capable of releasing Ca2+ after pretreatment of PC12 cells with bradykinin, suggesting that it acts on a channel contained within an intracellular Ca2+ store that is distinct from that sensitive to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate. Structure-activity relationship analyses suggest that the chloro and methyl groups in chlorocresols are important for the activation of the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channel.",

In RyR1, substitution of 11 amino acids conserved between RyR1 and RyR2, but divergent in RyR3, with their RyR3 counterparts reduced 4-CmC sensitivity to the same degree as substitution of the entire 173-amino acid segment. Further analysis of various RyR1 mutants containing successively smaller numbers of these mutations identified 2 amino acid residues (Gln(4020) and Lys(4021)) that, when mutated to their RyR3 counterparts (Leu(3873) and Gln(3874)), abolished 4-CmC activation of RyR1. Mutation of either of these residues alone did not abolish 4-CmC sensitivity, although Q4020L partially reduced 4-CmC-induced Ca /ion/ transients. In addition, mutation of the corresponding residues in RyR3 to their RyR1 counterparts (L3873Q/Q3874K) imparted 4-CmC sensitivity to RyR3. Recordings of single RyR1 channels indicated that 4-CmC applied to either the luminal or cytoplasmic side activated the channel with equal potency. Secondary structure modeling in the vicinity of the Gln(4020)-Lys(4021) dipeptide suggests that the region contains a surface-exposed region adjacent to a hydrophobic segment, indicating that both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of RyR1 are necessary for 4-CmC binding to the channel and/or to translate allosteric 4-CmC binding into channel activation.",

The rate of potassium, phosphate and adenosine triphosphate leakage was examined in the presence of chlorocresol and m-cresol. Individually, leakage was observed only at long contact times or high concentrations. Combined at these ineffective concentrations, the cytoplasmic pool of all constituents studied was released within minutes. Both chlorocresol and m-cresol were shown to have non-linear dose responses. A rate model for the combinations, which takes account of these non-linear responses, accurately predicted the observations. Antimicrobials, which when used alone exhibit a non-linear dose response, will also give a non-linear dose response in combination. The simple linear-additive model ignores the concept of the dilution coefficient and will always describe the phenomenon of synergy for combinations where one or more of the components has a dilution coefficient greater than one. This has been borne out by examination of the purported prime lesion of chlorocresol and m-cresol, alone and in combination. Studies aimed at producing synergistic mixtures of antimicrobials, which ignore the non-linear additive effect, may waste valuable research effort looking for a physiological explanation for an apparent synergy, where none, in-fact, exists. Patents granted on the basis of analyses using the linear-additive model for combinations of compounds with non-linear dose responses may no longer be supportable.",

All animals were killed 60 hr after dosing, and hepatic tissue was removed from the center of the right lobe of the liver for examination by electron microscopy. After dosing, the animals' behavior changed; after 30 minutes, the animals were uneasy and had \"ruffled-up\" coats. These signs diminished after 1 hr, but they were replaced by long \"apathetic motions\". After 24 hr until study termination, the hair coats were again altered. At necropsy, the liver appeared slightly enlarged and was a pale red color with pale gray spots. Light microscopy findings included a distinct dilation of the sinusoids with an activation of the Kupffer cells. The intercellular spaces were enlarged, and there were numerous vacuoles found in the cytoplasm. In electron micrographs, outpouchings of cell membranes were observed. A greater than normal number of lysosomes were around the bile canaliculi after dosing. Also, there was an increase in the number of mitochondria, many membrane-surrounded vacuoles, alterations in the intercellular space and in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and an increase in the number and size of gap junctions. Additionally, the bile canaliculi were dilated and had irregularities and side branches which extended into the cytoplasm of adjacent hepatocytes.",

Log Kow dependent linear regression analyses revealed that the data from each test system consisted of 2 linear equations. The less toxic chemicals form a relation which models polar CNS depression; these chemicals are slightly more active than the baseline toxicity of nonionic CNS depression chemicals. The more toxic chemicals form a relation which models uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Regression analysis of fathead minnow toxicity (log median lethal concn (mol/L) vs Tetrahymena pyriformis toxicity (log BR (mmol/L) showed good correlation between the two systems.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.0X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours. 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon a Koc of 490. The pKa of 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol is 9.55, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Half-lives of 4.2 days in acidic sandy loam with a low organic content and 1.4 days in basic sandy silt loam with a higher organic carbon content suggest biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation test results are conflicting. 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol was not degraded in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test perhaps due to microbial toxicity from the high concentration of the test chemical but reached 20-65% of the Theoretical Oxygen Demand after 28 days in the Closed Bottle Test. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 18 and 134 days, respectively. A BCF range of 5.5 to 13 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment because phenols are generally resistant to hydrolysis. Occupational exposure to 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol via ingestion of drinking water, where the chemical has been inadvertently formed during chlorination treatment, and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol.

Volatilization of 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 5.0X10-2 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 3,380 mg/L(6). 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(5).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 5.0X10-2 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 3,380 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 18 and 130, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF range of 5.5 to 13(7) suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation test results are conflicting(SRC). 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol was not degraded in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI(7), test perhaps due to microbial toxicity from the high concentration of the test chemical(SRC). 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol reached 20-65% of the Theoretical Oxygen Demand after 28 days in the Closed Bottle Test(8).",

Vapor-phase 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.6X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm(4), and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

A static flask screening procedure using settled domestic wastewater as the microbial inoculum found 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol to experience significant degradation with rapid adaptation as 100 percent of initial concentrations (5 and 10 ppm) biodegraded within 14 days(2). A 33.4% of the Theoretical BOD was determined with a Warburg respirometer, 210 minutes of incubation, and a mixed-culture inocula adapted to phenol(3). Using screening tests similar to detergent biodegradability studies, 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol demonstrated 30-100 percent degradation after 3 weeks under aerobic conditions(4). Using Sapromat-apparatus procedures, 85-100 percent degradation of 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol was observed after 24 hours with initial concentration up to 100 ppm(5). An activated sludge pilot plant was operated at 4, 6, and 9 day sludge ages with influent settled sewage from a full scale treatment works. High removal at all sludge ages in terms of the reduction in micropollutant concentration in influent sewage to final effluent was observed for 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol. The effluent for the 9 day sludge age tank had higher concentrations of 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol. Biological degradation was concluded to have taken place for 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol, since it exhibited poor association with sludge solids and, on theoretical grounds, is unlikely to be removed by air stripping(6). 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol, present at 100 mg/L, was not degraded in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(7), perhaps due to microbial toxicity from the high concentration of the test chemical(SRC). 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol, present at 2 mg/L in a Closed Bottle Test, reached 20-65% of the Theoretical Oxygen Demand after 28 days. When this test was repeated with bacteria preacclimatized in a successful Zahn-Wellens test, this compound reached 82-92% Theoretical Oxygen Demand(8).",

Half-lives were 21 days in both types of soil at initial concentrations of 10 and 1000 ppm each(2). The first order rate constant for the degradation of 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol was 0.0364 in sandy clay soil and 0.0338 in silty clay soil(2).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment because phenols are generally resistant to hydrolysis(2,3). The UV absorption spectrum of 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol exhibits absorption above 290 nm which suggests the potential for direct photolysis(3). Similar compounds (chlorophenol, dichlorophenol) have been shown to photodegrade in sunlight or UV light (above 290 nm), but the rate at which photolysis may occur in the environment has not been determined(3,4). Chlorinated phenols will undergo photolysis in aqueous solutions as a result of ultraviolet irradiation, and that photodegradation leads to the substitution of hydroxyl groups in place of the chlorine atoms with subsequent polymer formation(4). Indirect photolysis in water has been observed at 2.7 mg/L in the presence of humic acid with a half-life of 3.3-46 hours depending on exposure to artificial light or to sunlight(5).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The average concentration of 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol detected in sewage treatment effluents in England and Wales in 1995 was 0.3380 ug/L with a frequency of detection of 11.1%(3). Positive detections have been reported for raw and treated wastewaters from the auto, iron, and steel manufacturing, aluminum forming, foundries, metal finishing, photographic, pharmacutical manufacturing, paint and ink formulation, soap and detergent manufacturing, and textile industries; mean concentrations varied widely from 0.01 to 100,000 ug/L(4). 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol has been detected in the stack effluent from a municipal waste incinerator(5). This chemical was detected in the effluent of the waste water treatment plant of a paper mill at 1.8 ug/L(6). 3-Methyl-4-chlorophenol was detected in sewage sludge samples taken from waste water treatment plants in Brandenburg, Germany(7). Median concentrations were approximately 0.03 ug/kg in the summer and approximately 0.006 ug/kg in the winter(7). Maximum concentrations were approximately 0.1 ug/kg in the summer and approximately 0.8 ug/kg in the winter(7).",

The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

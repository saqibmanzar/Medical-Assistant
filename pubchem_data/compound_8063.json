Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Trigeminal neurons responded to homologous series of alcohols (C4-C7) as well as saturated and unsaturated aldehydes in a concentration dependent manner. Ranked in terms of threshold to recruit neurons by compounds of the same carbon chain length, enaldehyde<aldehyde<alcohol. Unlike aldehydes and alcohols that displayed ascending concentration curves, recruitment of neurons by enaldehydes (C4-C7) appeared to saturate, consistent with a mechanism that is restricted in its neural distribution. Using pentanol, pentanal and pentenal as model compounds, /it was/ found that many but not all cool/cold-sensitive and capsaicin-sensitive neurons responded with increases in intracellular calcium. These VOCs also stimulated other neurons that were insensitive to cooling and capsaicin. Because not all cooling- and all capsaicin-sensitive neurons responded to the model VOCs, it is highly unlikely that known nociceptive ion channels such as TRPV1 or TRPA1 mediate sensitivity to these compounds. For pentanol, pentanal and pentenal, induced calcium influx was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. Responses of all neurons to pentanal and pentenal were also dependent upon extracellular sodium. Responses to pentanol were variably dependent on sodium. The distribution of sensitivity suggests that VOC irritation may be mediated by an as yet unidentified mechanism(s) that is/are distributed across different modalities of neurons.",

In atherosclerosis inhibition of cell-cell communication by atherogenic compounds, e.g., low density lipoproteins (LDL), also seems to be important. For testing atherogenic compounds we used an atherosclerosis relevant cell type, namely human smooth muscle cells. In order to investigate which part of the LDL particle would be involved in inhibition of metabolic co-operation between human smooth muscle cells in culture ... several fatty acids and their breakdown products /were tested/, namely aldehydes. Unsaturated C-18 fatty acids markedly influenced gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), whereas saturated (C18:0, C16:0) and unsaturated fatty acids with > 20 carbon atoms did not inhibit GJIC. In the case of oleic and elaidic acid, orientation seemed important; however, after exposure to palmitoleic and palmitelaidic acid no differences were found. The most potent inhibitor of GJIC was linoleic acid, which inhibited GJIC by 75%. No correlation was found between degrees of unsaturation and ability to inhibit GJIC. Of the tested aldehydes, hexanal, propanal, butanal and 4-hydroxynonenal did significantly inhibit GJIC, while pentanal had no effect. Since modification of LDL was shown to be important in order for LDL to inhibit GJIC, these results show that fatty acids and their oxidative breakdown products may be of importance for the inhibition of GJIC by LDL.",

                                "Description": "The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical is an airborne concentration at which a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effect.  There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

These reactions are exothermic; they are often catalyzed by acid. Aldehydes are readily oxidized to give carboxylic acids. Flammable and/or toxic gases are generated by the combination of aldehydes with azo, diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, nitrides, and strong reducing agents. Aldehydes can react with air to give first peroxo acids, and ultimately carboxylic acids. These autoxidation reactions are activated by light, catalyzed by salts of transition metals, and are autocatalytic (catalyzed by the products of the reaction). The addition of stabilizers (antioxidants) to shipments of aldehydes retards autoxidation. This material is incompatible with oxidizing agents, strong bases and strong reducing agents. (NTP, 1992)",

Pentanal is a plant volatile and is also an emission product of microorganisms and animal waste. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 26 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates pentanal will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pentanal will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13.5-14.6 hours. Vapor-phase pentanal will also be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced nitrate radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 49 hours. Pentanal contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and will undergo photodegradation to form propene, vinyl alcohol and ethanal. If released to soil, pentanal is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 25. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.47X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Pentanal may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation of pentanal may be an important fate process in soil and water based upon a study in activated sludge from waste treatment plants in operation wherein a theoretical oxygen demand of 17.8% after 24 hrs was observed. If released into water, pentanal is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to pentanal may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pentanal is produced or used. Monitoring data and use information indicate that the general population may be exposed to pentanal via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with products containing pentanal.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.47X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). In activated sludge from waste treatment plants in operation, pentanal had a theoretical oxygen demand of 17.8% after 24 hrs(6), suggesting biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Pentanal is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

These correspond to atmospheric half-lives of about 14.6 and 13.5 hours, respectively, at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of pentanal with nitrate radical has been experimentally determined to be 1.65X10-14 cu cm/sec(1). This corresponds to atmospheric half-life of about 49 hours at a concentration of 2.4X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(3). Pentanal is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Pentanal does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and will undergo photodegradation to form propene, vinyl alcohol and ethanal(5).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Pentanal was identified as an ozone disinfection by-product in drinking water samples from a pilot plant in Jefferson Parish, LA which uses Mississippi River water as the raw water source; samples were collected following 4 rounds of ozonation treatment performed in January, 1994, August 1994, May 1995, and September 1996(2). Pentanal was not detected when using ozone, ozone with bromide, or chlorine dioxide with bromide disinfection processes, but was detected when using chloramination at 0.69 ug/L, chloramination with bromide at 0.62 ug/L, chlorine dioxide at 0.18 ug/L, chlorine at 0.66 ug/L, and chlorine with bromide treatments at 0.7 ug/L(3).",

Pentanal (as % of total non-methane organic compound emissions) was identified in regular gasoline (1.53%), high grade gasoline (1.49%), regular whole gas (2.97%), high grade whole gas (2.71%), roadway (1.91%), bus parking garage hot soak (0.70%), bus parking garage cold start (1.05%), motorcycle emissions (2.62%), petroleum refinery (0.83%), lead smelter (0.45%), cast iron factory emissions (0.58%), and natural gas (0.05%) in Cairo, Egypt(3). Pentanal sampling conducted in the Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel, PA gave the following results: light duty trucks emitted 0.05 mg/km traveled or 0.736 mg/L fuel used, heavy duty trucks emitted 0.617 mg/km traveled or 1.943 mg/L fuel used(4). Pentanal concns from automobile exhaust were 2.8-18 ppbv in models from 1971 and 1977(5). Pentanal was measured in the emissions of gasoline powered motor vehicles at a rate of 490 ug/km and 27,000 ug/km for catalyst equipped engines and non-catalyst equipped engines(6). Pentanal emissions from an automobile running on Swedish environmental classified diesel fuel were 3.6 mg/km and the same automobile running on European program emissions fuel were 2.8 mg/km(7).",

The mean and maximum concns of pentanal in air at these sites in the Netherlands were 0.05 and 0.40 ppb, respectively(1). The mean, minimum, and maximum 1-hr pentanal concns ranged from 0.15-1.07, 0.04-0.37, and 0.33-1.88 ppb, respectively(2) at four urban sites in Stockholm, Sweden. The corresponding concns at a recreational site 12 km outside the central city were 0.49, 0.12, and 1.99 ppb. Pentanal, analyzed in Athens, Greece, June to December 2000, was not detected at Patission Street(3). Pentanal was detected in Grenoble, France in samples taken May 4-11, 1995 at rue Jeanne D'Arc on the roof of a bike shop(4). Pentanal was detected at 0.92 ppb in 8 of 13 Helsinki samples tested May to Sep 1997(5). Pentanal was detected in air from San Paulo, Brazil at 0.016-0.668 ppb in samples taken July 1988(6). Pentanal was detected at 0.11, 0.18, and 0.20 ug/cu m in Frohnau, Nansenstrasze, and Frankfurter Allee, respectively, in Berlin, Germany from samples taken Jun-Aug 1996(7).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Mutagenesis of pJ4 by transposons Tn5 and Tn1771 enabled localization of five genes for enzymes involved in these catabolic pathways. Four of the genes, tfdB, tfdC, tfdD, and tfdE, encoded 2,4-dichlorophenol, hydroxylase, dichlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase, chloromuconate cycloisomerase, and chlorodienelactone hydrolase, respectively. No function has been assigned to the fifth gene, trans-chlorodiene lactone isomerase, although it may encode a trans-chlorodiene lactone isomerase. Inactivation of genes dichlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase, chloromuconate cycloisomerase, and chlorodienelactone hydrolase which encode the transformation of dichlorocatechol to chloromaleylacetic acid, prevented host strain JMP134 from degrading both 3-chlorobenzoate and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, which indicates that the pathways for these two substrates utilize common enzyme for the dissimilation of chlorocatechols. Studies with cloned catabolic genes from pJP4 indicated that whereas all essential steps in the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid are plasmid encoded, the conversion of 3-chlorobenzoate to chlorocatechol is specified by chromosomal genes.",

If released to soil, m-chlorobenzoic acid is expected to biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions although there may be a lengthy lag period before this process ensues. It is not expected to volatilize from either moist or dry soil to the atmosphere. m-Chlorobenzoic acid is expected to display moderate to high mobility in soil, and it will be predominately dissociated in moist soil under environmental conditions. If released to water, m-chlorobenzoic acid is expected to biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions although there may be a lengthy lag period. It is not expected to volatilize from water to the atmosphere, nor is it expected to adsorb to sediment and suspended organic matter. m-Chlorobenzoic acid will be predominately dissociated in water under the typical pH's found in the environment. If released to the atmosphere, m-chlorobenzoic acid may undergo a slow gas-phase reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of 38 days. m-Chlorobenzoic acid may also undergo atmospheric removal by wet deposition processes. Occupational exposure to m-chlorobenzoic acid may occur by dermal contact during its production, formulation or use. The general population may be exposed by the ingestion of contaminated drinking water. (SRC)",

It underwent 100% removal after 96 hrs when incubated with a mixed microbial seed under aerobic conditions(6).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

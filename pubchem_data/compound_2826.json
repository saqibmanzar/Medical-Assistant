For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

In addition, when research subjects were allowed to self-administer 16 or 32 mg cocaine intravenously every 6-10 min for an hr, the initial injections of drug exerted maximal cardiovascular and subjective effects, with subsequent repeated injections within an hr having smaller effects. This apparent tachyphylaxis does not appear to be dispositional because blood levels rose at a rate consistent with the dose being administered repeatedly.",

In recreational cocaine users, the relative bioavailability of the drug, as determined by area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), for a 2-mg/kg intranasal or oral dose of a 10% cocaine solution is the same; however, peak plasma concentrations are reportedly higher and occur sooner following oral administration than after intranasal administration. Following topical application of a 10% solution to the nasal mucosa, peak plasma cocaine concentrations occur within 15-120 minutes. Following topical application of cocaine hydrochloride solutions to mucous membranes, the onset of local anesthesia occurs within about 1 minute, is maximal within about 5 minutes, and may persist for 30 minutes or longer, depending on the dose and concentration used. /Cocaine hydrochloride/",

After oral administration, cocaine appears in blood after about 30 minutes, reaching a maximum concentration in 50 to 90 minutes. In acid medium, cocaine is ionized, and fails to cross into cells. In alkaline medium, there is less ionization and the absorption rapidly increases. By the nasal route, clinical effects are evident 3 minutes after administration, and last for 30 to 60 minutes, the peak plasma concentration being around 15 minutes. By oral or intra-nasal route, 60 to 80% of cocaine is absorbed. By inhalation, the absorption can vary from 20 to 60%, the variability being related to secondary vasoconstriction. Freebase does not undergo first-pass hepatic metabolism, and plasma concentrations rise immediately to 1 to 2 mg/L. The effects on the brain occur very rapidly, after about 8 to 12 seconds, are very violent (\"flash\"), and last only 5 to 10 minutes. By the intravenous route blood concentrations rise to a peak within a few minutes.",

Three major pathways of cocaine metabolism are well described. Cocaine undergoes N-demethylation in the liver to form norcocaine, a minor metabolite that rarely accounts for more than 5% of drug. However, norcocaine readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and produces clinical effects in animals that are quite similar to cocaine. Nearly half of a dose of cocaine is both nonenzymatically and enzymatically hydrolyzed to form benzoylecgonine (BE). the BE is inject into animals, some reports suggest that it is virtually inactive, while other studies demonstrate cerebral vasoconstriction and seizures. When with injected directly into the cerebral ventricles or applied to the surface of cerebral arteries, BE is a potent vasoconstrictor. Although BE tranverses the blood-brain barrier poorly, the potential effects ar of concern as some BE is probably formed form cocaine that has already entered the central nervous system (CNS). In vitro, BE has little or not effect on cardia sodium or potassium channels. Finally, plasma cholinesterase (PChE) and other esterases metabolize cocaine to ecgonine methyl ester (EME). In normal individuals, between 32% and 49% of cocaine is metabolized to EME. Like BE, EME crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Although many authors state that EME has little or no pharmacologic activity, diverse animal models demonstrate contradictory results, concluding that EME is a vasodilator, sedative, anticonvulsant, and protective metabolite against lethal doses of cocaine.",

The rate of metabolism varies according to plasma concentration. There are 3 routes of bio-transformation: the major route is hydrolysis of cocaine by hepatic and plasma esterases, with loss of a benzoyl group to give ecgonine methyl ester. Esterase activity varies substantially from one subject to another. The secondary route is spontaneous hydrolysis, probably non-enzymatic, which leads to benzoylecgonine by demethylation. The final degradation of cocaine, which is a sequel to both the principle and secondary routes of metabolism, leads to ecgonine. N-demethylation of cocaine is a minor route leading to norcocaine. The principle metabolites are therefore benzoylecgonine, ecgonine methyl ester, and ecgonine itself, which are inactive; and norcocaine which is active, and may be relevant after acute intoxication. In the presence of alcohol, a further active metabolite, cocaethylene is formed, and is more toxic then cocaine itself. ...",

It takes one half-life for plasma levels to fall to half of their original level. In the case of cocaine, it takes 1.5 hr for cocaine plasma levels to fall from 102 ng/mL. This is the same time that it takes for concentrations to fall from 51 ng/mL to 25.5 ng/mL. By five half-lives (7.5 hr) the plasma concentration of cocaine decreased from 102 ng/mL to 3.1 ng/mL, which is 3% of the original drug in the body. Almost all the drug (97%) will be eliminated by five half-lives. For reaching a certain drug level, an additional half-life will be required if the dose is doubled. For example, if cocaine is given at a dose of 40 mg, it will take two half-lives to reach the level of 51 ng/mL and six half-lives to reach the level of 3.1 ng/mL.",

This inhibition was mimicked by GW405833, another CB(2) receptor agonist with a different chemical structure, and was blocked by AM630, a selective CB(2) receptor antagonist. Intra-accumbens administration of JWH133 alone dose-dependently decreased, whereas intra-accumbens administration of AM630 elevated, extracellular dopamine and locomotion in wild-type and CB(1)(-/-) mice, but not in CB(2)(-/-) mice. Intra-accumbens administration of AM630 also blocked the reduction in cocaine self-administration and extracellular dopamine produced by systemic administration of JWH133. These findings suggest that brain CB(2) receptors modulate cocaine's rewarding and locomotor-stimulating effects, likely by a dopamine-dependent mechanism.",

When applied topically to the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth, cocaine reduces the acuity of smell or taste, respectively. Cocaine exerts an indirect adrenergic effect by interfering with the uptake of norepinephrine by adrenergic nerve terminals, and therefore potentiates the effects of catecholamines. The indirect adrenergic effect is apparently the mechanism by which the drug produces vasoconstriction and mydriasis.  Cocaine has CNS stimulating effects. The drug is also markedly pyrogenic, augmenting heat production by stimulating muscular activity and decreasing heat loss through vasoconstriction.",

The action responsible for the rewarding property, and hence the abuse liability, of cocaine is an action in the dopaminergic synapse; in the rat the major set of critical dopaminergic synapses appears to be in the nucleus accumbens. Cocaine prolongs the activity of dopamine in the synapse by blocking the dopamine reuptake mechanism (which usually inactivates the transmitter by removing it from the proximity of its synaptic targets). This is an action shared with amphetamine; in addition to blocking the dopamine reuptake mechanism, amphetamine also augments dopaminergic function by augmenting dopamine release directly into the synapse. While amphetamine and cocaine have discriminable subjective effects, perhaps due to differences in rate of onset and metabolism or perhaps due to different side effects, cocaine shares its rewarding impact and abuse liability very closely with amphetamine. When drug access is unlimited, cocaine and amphetamine have the same ability to dominate behavior, reducing other behaviors such as feeding and sleeping and, in the process, reducing stress resistance to life threatening levels.",

Dopamine reuptake inhibition has been confirmed in a number of studies and is consistent with acutely increased dopamine neurotransmission. A further reflection of increased synaptic availability of dopamine is the finding of elevated 3-methoxytyramine but normal homovanillic acid concentrations after cocaine administration. Cocaine also causes reductions in brain dopamine concentrations with repeated administration. Cocaine elevates brain dopamine concentrations acutely, followed by reductions below normal levels several minutes later. Cocaine has also been shown to inhibit dopamine vesicle binding, thereby exposing /dopamine/ to intracellular metabolism.",

It utilizes an inert gas, such as nitrogen or helium, as the moving phase to transport a vaporized sample of a drug through a glass column containing a stationary liquid phase. The drug is identified and quantified by a detector at the far end of the column. The column's capability to separate and identify drugs is optimized by altering the types and amounts of a liquid (stationary phase) adsorbed on solid phase substances such as silica compounds. Typically, columns used in many gas chromatography methods are 3-6 feet in length and a few millimeters in diameter. /Drugs/",

This method identifies unchanged cocaine ... as well as benzoylecgonine concn as low as 2 ug/mL. A special thin layer chromatography solvent system is necessary to separate cocaine from the ethyl homolog cocaethylene formed in the presence of ethanol. Gas liquid chromatographic techniques using derivation followed by nitrogen specific or electron capture detection are more sensitive for benzoylecgonine (detection limit, 5 ng/mL) and efficiently detect the low cocaine levels found in blood and plasma. This technique can identify post mortem cocaine levels in bile, liver, and brain as well as in blood & urine.",

Cocaine freebase and cocaine hydrochloride are white solid crystals. Street cocaine used by addicts can be mixed with amphetamines, anti-histamines, benzocaine, inositol, lactose, lidocaine, mannitol, opioids, phencyclidine, procaine, sugars, tetracaine, and sometimes arsenic, caffeine, quinidine, and even flour or talc. Cocaine hydrochloride has a very limited use for anesthesia. Cocaine is Schedule II Controlled Substance. HUMAN STUDIES: The target organs are central nervous system (CNS) and the cardio-vascular system. Abuse of cocaine leads to strong psychological dependence. In low doses acute intoxication causes euphoria and agitation. Larger doses cause hyperthermia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmia, hypertension, extreme anxiety, agitation, hallucination, and mydriasis. These can be followed by CNS depression with irregular respirations, convulsions, coma, cardiac disturbances, collapse and death.  Chronic intoxication produces euphoria, agitation psychomotor, suicidal ideation, anorexia, weight loss, hallucinations and mental deterioration. A withdrawal syndrome with severe psychiatric effects can occur (euphoria, depression). Cocaine causes hyperthermia as a result of two mechanisms: the increase in muscular activity and a direct effect on thermal regulatory centers. The visceral effects on liver and kidney are due to dopaminergic action of cocaine, or its metabolites, or to impurities. The abrupt increase intra-alveolar pressure can cause alveolar rupture and pneumomediastinum. Rhabdomyolysis occurs as a result of several different mechanisms: direct effect on muscle and muscle metabolism, tissue ischemia, the effects of drugs taken with cocaine, such as alcohol and heroin. The principle effects of cocaine are the result of its sympathetic action: cocaine prevents the re-uptake of dopamine and noradrenaline, which accumulate and stimulate neuronal receptors. At the same time, the release of serotonin a sedative neurotransmitter, is inhibited. There may also be a direct effect on peripheral organs.  Applied locally, cocaine blocks neuronal transmission: this results in a powerful local anesthetic action at the level of sensory nerve terminals. A recent meta-analysis shows an increase in congenital malformation rate in the offspring of cocaine-users, particularly for abnormalities of the limbs, the genito-urinary tract, and the cardiovascular, neurological, and digestive systems. Patients with choline esterase deficiency may develop severe reactions. ANIMAL STUDIES: Rats given a moderate dose of cocaine show increased locomotor activity and stereotypic behavior. These behaviors are thought to be mediated by the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine pathways, respectively. In rats exposed to continuous cocaine, persistent changes in acetylcholine and GABA receptors in the caudate were observed 30 days after removal of cocaine pellets, suggesting that they were long lasting or permanent. In contrast to continuous cocaine infusion, daily injections of 20 mg of cocaine for 5 days failed to produce neurodegeneration but did result in behavioral sensitization. Studies with animals demonstrate that cocaine is three times as lethal as heroin. Ninety percent of animals with free access to cocaine are dead in three months, while only 30% of those with free access to heroin are dead in the same amount of time. Monkeys with unlimited access to cocaine will choose it over food until they starve. Cocaine-induced hepatotoxicity was encountered while studying sensitization to the stimulant effects of cocaine. The surface of livers from mice that had received four or five daily injections of 20 mg/kg cocaine had an unusual pitted or roughened appearance. It was found that a single injection of 50 mg/kg cocaine could produce severe fatty necrosis of the liver. Cocaine caused a 36% drop in fetal oxygen partial pressure following a 2 mg/kg dose of cocaine to the ewe, simultaneously, it caused a 25% rise in fetal blood pressure. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Cyto-genotoxic effects were evidenced in mussels exposed to crack cocaine concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 ug/L. Exposure to cocaine and its metabolites significantly altered the protein profile of zebrafish embryos, modulating the expression of diverse proteins belonging to different functional classes, including cytoskeleton, eye constituents, lipid transport, lipid and energy metabolism, and stress response. Expression of vitellogenins and crystallins was modulated by cocaine and its main metabolites.",

Cocaine breastmilk concentrations have varied over 100-fold in these reports. Newborn infants are extremely sensitive to cocaine because they have not yet developed the enzyme that inactivates it and serious adverse reactions have been reported in a newborn infant exposed to cocaine via breastmilk.",

One week later she used about 500 mg of cocaine intranasally over a 4-hour period and breastfed 5 times during this period. Three hours after first ingesting the cocaine, the mother noted that her infant became markedly irritable, had dilated pupils, and began vomiting and having diarrhea. The infant became increasingly irritable and was taken to the emergency room 4 hours later. On examination, the infant was found to be tremulous and irritable with frequent startling after minimal stimulation, and to have high-pitched crying, hyperactive reflexes, mood lability, and hypertension. The infant also had some signs of fetal alcohol syndrome. The infant remained irritable 12 hours after the last cocaine exposure and remained tremulous and easily startled 24 hours after the last exposure. Irritability and tremulousness slowly abated over the subsequent 24 hours. Mild hypertension persisted up to 72 hours after the last cocaine exposure via breastmilk.",

The identification of addiction resilience factors is a potential strategy to identify new mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically. Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear sulfated polysaccharide that is a component of the cell surface and extracellular matrix. Heparan sulfate modulates the activity and distribution of a set of negatively charged signaling peptides and proteins - known as the HS interactome - by acting as a co-receptor or alternative receptor for growth factors and other signaling peptides and sequestering and localizing them, among other actions. Here, we show that stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine greatly increase HS content and sulfation levels in the lateral hypothalamus and that HS contributes to the regulation of cocaine seeking and taking. The ability of the HS-binding neuropeptide glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to increase cocaine intake was potentiated by a deletion that abolished its HS binding. The delivery of heparanase, the endo-beta-D-glucuronidase that degrades HS, accelerated the acquisition of cocaine self-administration and promoted persistent responding during extinction. Altogether, these results indicate that HS is a resilience factor for cocaine abuse and a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of cocaine addiction.",

Recently, chemical interactions between heroin (Her) or its metabolite morphine (Mor) and cocaine (Coc) were described, resulting in the formation of strong adducts. In this work, we evaluated whether combinations of Coc and Her affect the neurotoxicity of these drugs, using rat cortical neurons incubated with Coc, Her, Her followed by Coc (Her+Coc) and Her plus Coc (Her:Coc, 1:1). Neurons exposed to Her, Her+Coc and Her:Coc exhibited a decrease in cell viability, which was more pronounced in neurons exposed to Her and Her+Coc, in comparison with neurons exposed to the mixture (Her:Coc). Cells exposed to the mixture showed increased intracellular calcium and mitochondrial dysfunction, as determined by a decrease in intracellular ATP levels and in mitochondrial membrane potential, displaying both apoptotic and necrotic characteristics. Conversely, a major increase in cytochrome c release, caspase 3-dependent apoptosis, and decreased metabolic neuronal viability were observed upon sequential exposure to Her and Coc. The data show that drug combinations potentiate cortical neurotoxicity and that the mode of co-exposure changes cellular death pathways activated by the drugs, strongly suggesting that chemical interactions occurring in Her:Coc, such as adduct formation, shift cell death mechanisms towards necrosis. Since impairment of the prefrontal cortex is involved in the loss of impulse control observed in drug addicts, the data presented here may contribute to explain the increase in treatment failure observed in speedball abusers.",

Treat coma, agitation, seizures, hyperthermia, arrhythmias, and hypotension if they occur. Benzodiazepines are a good choice for initial management of hypertension and tachycardia associated with agitation. 3. Angina pectoris may be treated with benzodiazepines, aspirin, nitrates, or calcium channel blockers. For acute myocardial infarction, thrombolysis has been recommended but is controversial. Supporting its use is the high prevalence of acute thrombosis, often superimposed on coronary spasm. Against its use are the excellent prognosis for patients with cocaine induced infarction, even without thrombolysis, and concerns about increased risk of bleeding caused by intracranial hemorrhage or aortic dissections. 4. Monitor vital signs and extracellular fluid (ECF) for several hours. Patients with suspected coronary artery spasm should be admitted to a coronary care unit, and because of reports of persistent or recurrent coronary spasm up to several days after initial exposure, consider the sue of an oral calcium antagonist and/or cardiac nitrates for 2-4 weeks after discharge.",

Pain, photophobia, and decreased visual acuity associated with an iritis may develop a few hours after the use of intranasal cocaine. Deep inhalation may deposit adulterants near the ethmoid sinuses, leading to sinusitis. Bilateral optic neuropathy with decreased visual acuity and optic nerve head swelling may occur secondary to osteolytic sinusitis. In long-term cocaine snorters rebound nasal stuffiness develops after intranasal use that is often self treated with nasal inhalers, sprays, and drops containing phenylephrine, oxymetazoline, beclomethasone, and flunisolide, all drugs that can contribute to nasal mucoperichondrial necrosis and septal perforations. After nasal insufflation of cocaine, material may be drawn into the nasopharynx and from there into the mouth, resulting in a mixture of cocaine with saliva. The end product is an acid capable of dissolving the predominant dental mineral, calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite, from enamel and dentin.",

Cocaine (0.025-4 mg/kg) was administered to unanesthetized, unrestrained rats via a cannula placed into the lateral ventricle. Procaine (0.1 and 4 mg/kg) was also administered centrally. Cocaine did not significantly alter blood pressure at doses of 0.025, 0.1, or 0.5 mg/kg, icv. Only the highest dose, 4 mg/kg, icv produced a significant pressor response. Cocaine produced significant dose-dependent tachycardia, with the maximum increase in heart rate occurring witin 5 min. Procaine (4 mg/kg, icv) produced tachycardia, but the effect was significantly less than that produced by cocaine (4 mg/kg, icv). Cocaine also produced tachycardia at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg but procaine did not significantly alter heart rate at the same dose. Central phentolamine pretreatment (0.1 mg/kg, icv) significantly attenuated the increase in heart rate produced by cocaine. These results indicate that the centrally mediated tachycardia produced by cocaine is partly due to its local anesthetic activity and to indirect stimulation of alpha receptors.",

We found a decrease in DNA methylation at a specific CpG site in TACR3, but not DAT1 or SERT. Thus, TACR3 is a locus for DNA methylation changes in response to repeated cocaine administration and its establishment as a reinforcer, in support of other evidence implicating the NK3-R in reinforcement- and addiction-related processes.",

Compared to saline offspring, cocaine and amitriptyline exposed litters were underweight at birth, but there were no differences between groups at 15 or 30 days of age. There were more birth defects and stillbirths in cocaine exposed offspring, however, there were no differences in male/female sex ratios or litter size in any group. Number of days to righting reflex was delayed in the cocaine-exposed group, but there were no changes in time to eye opening. Cocaine and amitriptyline exposed pups were hyperactive at 30 days of age, though no differences were found in an initial 15 min exploration period. Only the amfonelic acid exposed offspring were hyperactive at 60 days postnatal. Since cocaine and amitriptyline decreased birth weights, this effect may be related to the nondopaminergic effects of cocaine. These data demonstrate that cocaine exposure in utero at relevant doses can affect neonatal outcome and long term development in rat offspring.",

Among illicit drug residues, cocaine (COC) and its main metabolites, namely benzoylecgonine (BE) and ecgonine methyl ester (EME), are commonly detected in freshwaters worldwide at concentration that can induce diverse adverse effects to non-target organisms. However, the information of toxicity and mechanisms of action (MoA) of these drugs, mainly of COC metabolites, to aquatic species is still fragmentary and inadequate. Thus, this study was aimed at investigating the toxicity of two concentrations (0.3 and 1.0 ug/L) of COC, BE and EME similar to those found in aquatic ecosystems on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos at 96 hr post fertilization through a functional proteomics approach. Exposure to COC and both its metabolites significantly altered the protein profile of zebrafish embryos, modulating the expression of diverse proteins belonging to different functional classes, including cytoskeleton, eye constituents, lipid transport, lipid and energy metabolism, and stress response. Expression of vitellogenins and crystallins was modulated by COC and both its main metabolites, while only BE and EME altered proteins related to lipid and energy metabolism, as well as to oxidative stress response. Our data confirmed the potential toxicity of low concentrations of COC, BE and EME, and helped to shed light on their MoA on an aquatic vertebrate during early developmental period.",

Cocaine is found in and extracted from the species of the plant family Coca. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.91X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cocaine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase cocaine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.3 hours. Particulate-phase cocaine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Cocaine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, cocaine is expected to have low mobility based upon a log Koc of 2.78. The pKa value of cocaine is 8.61 indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to  soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil of the cation is not expected because cations do not volatilize. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces of neutral cocaine is not expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Cocaine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, cocaine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the log Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's pKa and estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 15 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 55 and 5.5 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to cocaine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cocaine is produced or used. Limited monitoring data suggests the general population may be exposed to cocaine via dermal contact with contaminated water. Use data indicates the general public is legally exposed to cocaine by direct medical treatment. Broader exposure to cocaine among the general population will be due to its illicit use. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase cocaine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.3 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.3X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase cocaine may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). Cocaine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

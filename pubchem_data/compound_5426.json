An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Even a single dose (1 capsule (regardless of strength)) taken by a pregnant woman during her pregnancy can cause severe birth defects.  Because of this toxicity and in an effort to make the chance of embryo-fetal exposure to Thalomid (thalidomide) as negligible as possible, Thalomid (thalidomide) is approved for marketing only through a special restricted distribution program: Thalomid REMS program, approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

The use of Thalomid (thalidomide) in multiple myeloma results in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.  This risk increases significantly when thalidomide is used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents including dexamethasone. In one controlled trial, the rate of venous thromboembolism was 22.5% in patients receiving thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone compared to 4.9% in patients receiving dexamethasone alone (p = 0.002). Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Instruct patients to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Consider thromboprophylaxis based on an assessment of individual patients' underlying risk factors.",

Additionally, thalidomide is also shown to inhibit basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting a potential anti-angiogenic application of thalidomide in cancer patients.  Thalidomide is racemic &mdash; it contains both left and right handed isomers in equal amounts: the (+)R enantiomer is effective against morning sickness, and the (&minus;)S enantiomer is teratogenic. The enantiomers are interconverted to each other in vivo; hence, administering only one enantiomer will not prevent the teratogenic effect in humans.",

The mean time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) ranged from 2.9 to 5.7 hours following a single dose from 50 to 400 mg. Patients with Hansen\u2019s disease may have an increased bioavailability of thalidomide, although the clinical significance of this is unknown.   Due to its low aqueous solubility and thus low dissolution is the gastrointestinal tract, thalidomide's absorption is slow, with a  tlag of 20-40 min. Therefore, thalidomide exhibits absorption rate-limited pharmacokinetics or \"flip-flop\" phenomenon. Following a single dose of 200 mg in healthy male subjects, cmax and AUC\u221e were calculated to be 2.00 \u00b1 0.55 mg/L and 19.80 \u00b1 3.61 mg*h/mL respectively.",

Chiral inversion was catalyzed by albumin, hydroxyl ions, phosphate and amino acids. Basic amino acids (arginine and lysine) had a superior potency in catalyzing chiral inversion compared to acid and neutral ones. The chiral inversion of thalidomide is thus subject to specific and general base catalysis and it is suggested that the ability of HSA to catalyze the reaction is due to basic groups of the amino acids arginine and lysine and not to a single catalytic site on the macromolecule. The hydrolysis of thalidomide was also base catalyzed. ... Albumin had no effect on hydrolysis and there was no difference between the catalytic potencies of acidic, neutral and base amino acids. ... Chiral inversion is deduced to occur by electrophilic substitution involving specific and general base catalysis, whereas hydrolysis is thought to occur by nucleophilic substitution involving specific and general base as well as nucleophilic catalysis. As nucleophilic attack is sensitive to steric properties of the catalyst, steric hindrance might be the reason albumin is not able to catalyze hydrolysis. (1)H NMR experiments revealed that the three teratogenic metabolites of thalidomide, in sharp contrast to the drug itself had complete chiral stability. This leads to the speculation that, were some enantioselectivity to exist in the teratogenicity of thalidomide, it could result from fast hydrolysis to chirally stable teratogenic metabolites.",

These results suggest that the anti-angiogenic effects of thalidomide may only be observed following metabolic activation of the compound. This activation process may be species specific, similar to the teratogenic properties associated with thalidomide. Using a rat aorta model and human aortic endothelial cells, we co-incubated thalidomide in the presence of either human, rabbit, or rat liver microsomes. These experiments demonstrated that thalidomide inhibited microvessel formation from rat aortas and slowed human aortic endothelial cell proliferation in the presence of human or rabbit microsomes, but not in the presence of rat microsomes. In the absence of microsomes, thalidomide had no effect on either microvessel formation or cell proliferation, thus demonstrating that a metabolite of thalidomide is responsible for its anti-angiogenic effects and that this metabolite can be formed in both humans and rabbits, but not in rodents. /There are five primary metabolites of thalidomide [4-OH-thalidomide, 3-OH-thalidomide, 39-OH-thalidomide, 49-OH-thalidomide, and 59-OH-thalidomide], and the antiangiogenic property could be the result of either of these compounds, or of an intermediate. Also, thalidomide undergoes rapid spontaneous hydrolysis in aqueous solutions at a pH of 6.0 or greater to form three primary products [4-phthalimidoglutaramic acid, 2-phthalimidoglutaramic acid, and a-(o-carboxybenzamido) glutarimide] and eight minor products. Furthermore, each of the five metabolites of the parent compound undergoes similar hydrolysis./",

Thalidomide itself does not appear to be hepatically metabolized to any large extent, but appears to undergo non-enzymatic hydrolysis in plasma to multiple metabolites. Thalidomide may be metabolized hepatically by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The end product of metabolism, phthalic acid, is excreted as a glycine conjugate. In a repeat dose study in which THALOMID&#8482; (thalidomide) 200 mg was administered to 10 healthy females for 18 days, thalidomide displayed similar pharmacokinetic profiles on the first and last day of dosing. This suggests that thalidomide does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism.\nRoute of Elimination: Thalidomide itself has less than 0.7% of the dose excreted in the urine as unchanged drug.\nHalf Life: The mean half-life of elimination ranges from approximately 5 to 7 hours following a single dose and is not altered upon multiple dosing.",

The pharmacokinetics and hemodynamic effects of two oral doses of thalidomide (100 and 200 mg) were investigated, using a randomized two period crossover design, in a group of asymptomatic male HIV seropositive subjects. Thalidomide pharmacokinetics were linear at the doses studied, and were best described by a one compartment model with first order absorption and elimination processes. The drug was rapidly absorbed with a mean absorption half life of 0.95 hr (range 0.16-2.49 hr) and 1.19 hr (0.33-3.53 hr) after 100 and 200 mg doses, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values were 1.15 +/-0.24 ug/mL (100 mg) and 1.92 +/- 0.47- ug/mL (200 mg; p<0.001) which were achieved (Tmax) at 2.5 +/-1.5 hr and 3.3 +/-1.4 hr, respectively. Plasma concn of thalidomide declined thereafter, in a log linear manner, with elimination half lives of 4.6+/-1.2 hr (100 mg) and 5.3+/-2.2 hr -(200 mg). The apparent volumes of distribution (Vdss/F) were 69.9+/-1.56 L (100 mg) and 82.7+/-34.9 L (200 mg) while total body clearances (C1F) were 10.4+/-2.1 and 10.8+/- 1.7 L/hr, respectively. ...",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Previous research indicate that thalidomide binds to cerebron, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, to selectively degrade the transcription factor IKZF3 and IKZF1. These 2 transcription factors are vital for the proliferation and survival of malignant myeloma cells.   Regarding TNF-alpha, thalidomide seems to block this mediator via a variety of mechanism. Thalidomide can inhibit the expression myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88), an adaptor protein that is involved in the TNF-alpha production signalling pathway, at the protein and RNA level. Additionally, thalidomide prevents the activation of Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kB), another upstream effector of the TNF-alpha production pathway. Finally, some evidences suggest that thalidomide can block alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), a known inducer of the NF-kB/MyD88 pathway, thus inhibiting the expression of TNF-alpha. The down-regulation of NF-kB and MyD88 can also affect the cross talk between the NF-kB/MyD88 and VEGF pathway, resulting in thalidomide's anti-angiogenic effect.",

Although the mechanism of teratogenesis and determinants of risk remain unclear, related teratogenic xenobiotics are bioactivated by embryonic prostaglandin H synthase (PHS) to a free-radical intermediates that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause oxidative damage to DNA and other cellular macromolecules. Similarly, thalidomide is bioactivated by horseradish peroxidase, and oxidizes DNA and glutathione, indicating free radical-mediated oxidative stress. Furthermore, thalidomide teratogenicity in rabbits is reduced by the PHS inhibitor acetylsalicylic acid, indicating PHS-catalyzed bioactivation. Here, we show in rabbits that thalidomide initiates embryonic DNA oxidation and teratogenicity, both of which are abolished by pre-treatment with the free radical spin trapping agent alpha-phenyl-N-t-butylnitrone (PBN). In contrast, in mice, a species resistant to thalidomide teratogenicity, thalidomide does not enhance DNA oxidation, even at a dose 300% higher than that used in rabbits, providing insight into an embryonic determinant of species-dependent susceptibility. In addition to their therapeutic implications, these results constitute direct evidence that the teratogenicity of thalidomide may involve free radical-mediated oxidative damage to embryonic cellular macromolecules.",

Thalidomide has been used in the treatment of refractory Crohn's disease (CD), but the therapeutic mechanism is not defined. We examined the effect of thalidomide on primary cultures of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC), the relevant endothelial cell population in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), to determine its effect on endothelial activation, leukocyte interaction, and VEGF-induced angiogenesis. HIMEC cultures were pretreated with thalidomide before activation with either TNF-alpha/LPS or VEGF. A low-shear-stress flow adhesion assay with either U-937 or whole blood was used to assess HIMEC activation following TNF-alpha/LPS, and a Wright's stain identified adherent leukocytes. Expression of cell adhesion molecules (E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) was assessed using radioimmunoassay. Effects of thalidomide on NF-kappaB activation, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in TNF-alpha/LPS-activated HIMEC were determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Thalidomide blocked adhesion of both U-937 and whole blood leukocytes by 50% in HIMEC, inhibiting binding of all classes of leukocytes. Thalidomide also blocked NF-kappaB and cell adhesion molecule expression in HIMEC. In marked contrast, thalidomide did not affect either iNOS or COX-2 expression, two key molecules that play a role in the downregulation of HIMEC activation. VEGF-induced HIMEC transmigration, growth, proliferation, tube formation, and Akt phosphorylation were significantly inhibited by thalidomide. In summary, thalidomide exerted a potent effect on HIMEC growth and activation, suggesting that it may also function via an endothelial mechanism in the treatment of CD.",

Thalidomide treated LNCaP /prostate/ cells demonstrated an incr prostate specific antigen/cell levels at all concn tested compared to untreated control cells. Thalidomide demonstrated a cytostatic effect in LNCaP cells but had no appreciable effect on PC-3 cell viability compared to untreated control cells. Comparison of cDNA expression arrays hybridized with thalidomide treated LNCaP cDNA probes suggests that thalidomide may up or down regulate expression of angiogenesis related genes, ie. vitronectin, but these differential effects require further verification. Thalidomide over a range of doses has demonstrated nontoxic, cytostatic activity in LNCaP cells and significant up regulation of LNCaP cell prostate specific antigen secretion in vitro. ... Preliminary data from cDNA nucleic acid arrays of thalidomide treated LNCaP cells suggest that thalidomide up regulates a potential angiogenic modulatory protein, the vitronectin precursor, which may eventually link thalidomide's antiangiogenic activity with modulation of antiogenic vascular pathways.",

In vitro studies have shown that thalidomide inhibits tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA expression and protein production by mitogen-stimulated macrophages and activated T cells. Even at the highest concentration (10-1 mM) tested, however, TNF-alpha levels are inhibited only partially and the mechanism of action is unknown. In the present investigations, we have examined the influence of thalidomide on nuclear levels of NF-kappa B in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) following activation with mitogen or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)/ionophore. Dexamethasone was used as a positive control due to its well-characterised mechanism of action and NF-kappa B-mediated effects on TNF-alpha expression. PBMC from healthy human volunteers were stimulated optimally with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or PMA/ionophore in the presence of 10(-1)-10(-5) mM thalidomide or dexamethasone, concentrations that displayed a range of inhibitory effects on TNF-alpha production. Cells were harvested at varying time points and nuclear extracts prepared. Nuclear levels of NF-kappa B were measured using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with a radiolabelled DNA probe specific for NF-kappa B. Results were analysed using optical densitometry. Nuclear levels of NF-kappa B were found to be unaffected by thalidomide at all concentrations tested, including concentrations (10(-1)-10(-3) mM) that exhibited significant inhibition of TNF-alpha protein and mRNA expression. In concurrent experiments, dexamethasone was found to reduce NF-kappa B expression in a dose-dependent manner with maximal inhibition at the highest dose tested (10(-1) mM). TNF-alpha gene expression is controlled by at least three separate transcription factors that are involved in binding to the promoter region. These observations suggest that thalidomide does not act directly on NF-kappa B and therefore inhibits TNF-alpha production through another independent mechanism.",

Because of this toxicity and in an effort to make the chance of embryo-fetal exposure to Thalomid (thalidomide) as negligible as possible, Thalomid (thalidomide) is approved for marketing only through a special restricted distribution program: Thalomid REMS program, approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

The first reports on malformations due to rubella virus infections, ionizing radiation, hormones, dietary deficiencies, and chemicals appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, but the potential impact of reproductive toxicity on public health was only recognized more than two decades later. In 1960, a large increase in newborns with specific limb malformations, which are rarely seen otherwise, was recorded in Germany and in other parts of the world. One year later, the sedative/hypnotic drug thalidomide was recognized as the causative agent. The thalidomide epidemic resulted in 10,000 malformed children and subsided after the drug was withdrawn from the market at the end of 1961. One important consequence of the thalidomide disaster was the introduction of requirements for the testing of potential new drugs for reproductive toxicity. All test batteries required include detailed tests for reproductive toxicity to prevent a repetition of the thalidomide disaster.",

By 1958, thalidomide was being heavily advertised and promoted around the world. However, in April 1961, obstetrician William McBride began to notice cases of a rare birth defect involving shortened or absent limbs in babies whose mothers had used thalidomide in pregnancy. At the Crown St. Women's Hospital in Sidney, Australia, where McBride practiced, he soon persuaded the hospital to stop using the drug and wrote of his concerns to Distillers, the company that sold the drug in Australia. At about the same time, pediatrician and geneticist Widukind Lenz noted many similar cases in Germany, where thalidomide was available without prescription. At this time, physicians assumed that the placenta was impervious to any drugs the expectant mother ingested -- unless the drug actually killed her. This belief persisted despite experimental evidence to the contrary. Since thalidomide was not fatal in overdose, it was deemed safe. When thalidomide was approved, drugs were not tested in pregnant animals for their teratogenic effect - that is, for their ability to cause developmental abnormalities in the fetus. McBride wrote ... a leading medical journal, The Lancet, to alert the medical community to the dangers of thalidomide. ... McBride's warning concerning the teratogenic effects of thalidomide saved countless babies from being born with birth defects. However, the drug remained on the market or some time following McBride's warning, which accounts for the fact that there are still some 8,000 thalidomide survivors in the world today.",

Although thalidomide was not commercially available in the US at that time, there were at least 17 reports of infants with thalidomide-associated birth defects being born to women in the US during those years; these women had received the drug from overseas sources or received premarketing samples distributed by drug company representatives.",

Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and sedative and hypnotic activity. It is used for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). It is also used as maintenance therapy for prevention and suppression of the cutaneous manifestations of erythema nodosum leprosum recurrence. It is used in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Overdosage of thalidomide may cause prolonged sleep as a result of the drug's sedative and hypnotic effects, but fatalities are unlikely since the drug does not cause respiratory depression. In 3 reported suicide attempts involving deliberate ingestion of up to 14.4 g of thalidomide, all individuals recovered without reported sequelae. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen. The severe malformation induced by thalidomide may involve defects of the limbs, axial skeleton, head and face, eyes, ears, tongue, teeth, central nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, and the gastrointestinal tract. The neurological complications may include severe mental retardation secondary to sensory deprivation. Thus, thalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy. Thalidomide is also known to cause nerve damage that may be permanent. Peripheral neuropathy is a common (> or =10%) and potentially severe adverse reaction of treatment with thalidomide that may be irreversible. Seizures have been reported, including  tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures. Serious dermatologic reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which may be fatal, have also been reported. The use of thalidomide in multiple myeloma patients causes an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. ANIMAL STUDIES: In an acute toxicity study, guinea pigs administered a 650 mg/kg oral dose became quiet and sedated. Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in male and female mice, male and female rats. No compound-related tumorigenic effects were observed at the highest dose levels in male and female mice (9 to 14-fold human exposure), and male rats (12-fold human exposure). In female rats, a tumorigenic effect was not observed at 300 mg/kg/day (16-fold human exposure). In another carcinogenicity study, 56 adult beagle dogs were orally administered thalidomide for 53 weeks. There were no deaths during the study. There was no gross and histopathologic evidence of any tumors. A large number of reproductive studies have shown that thalidomide is a potent teratogen. Cynomolgus monkeys were orally administered thalidomide at 15 or 20 mg/kg-d on days 26-28 of gestation, and fetuses were examined on day 100-102 of gestation. Limb defects such as micromelia/amelia, paw/foot hyperflexion, polydactyly, syndactyly, and brachydactyly were observed in seven of eight fetuses. The teratogenicity of thalidomide in rats was investigated after a single maternal intravenous injection during the organogenesis period. Thalidomide induced skeletal deformities of thoracic ribs and of the spinal column in fetuses upon maternal administration of the drug. Deformities of the eyeball in fetuses were induced by the maternal administration of the drug on day 10 and 12. A single dose (500 mg/kg) of thalidomide was administered orally to pregnant rabbits in various stages of organogenesis. Head anomalies in fetuses were induced at a high frequency by the maternal administration of thalidomide on day 7. Microphthalmia in fetuses was observed with a single administration from day 7 to 12 of gestation. Contracture of forearms and club foot in fetuses resulted from the maternal administration of thalidomide on day 8 or 9 of gestation, respectively. With a single administration on day 8 or 9 of gestation, kinky tail in fetuses resulted, and brachyury was observed with a high frequency from day 8 to 11 of gestation. Skeletal anomalies such as fusion or displacement of coccygeal vertebral bodies were observed at a high frequency with a single treatment from day 8 to 10 of gestation. Among the internal anomalies observed was abnormal lobation of the lung, and abnormal lobation of the liver, cardiovascular anomalies. Fertility studies were conducted in male and female rabbits; no compound-related effects in mating and fertility indices were observed at any oral thalidomide dose level including the highest of 100 mg/kg/day to female rabbits and 500 mg/kg/day to male rabbits. Thalidomide was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic in the following assays: the Ames bacterial (Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli) reverse mutation assay, a Chinese hamster ovary cell forward mutation assay, and an in vivo mouse micronucleus test.",

Available data from in vitro studies and preliminary clinical trials suggest that the immunologic effects of this compound can vary substantially under different conditions, but may be related to suppression of excessive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) production and down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration. For example, administration of thalidomide has been reported to decrease circulating levels of TNF-a in patients with ENL, however, it has also been shown to increase plasma TNF-a levels in HIV-seropositive patients. As a cancer treatment, the drug may act as a VEGF inhibitor.",

The enzyme abnormalities are usually mild and self-limited, and only rarely require drug discontinuation. In addition, both thalidomide and its derivatives, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, have been implicated in rare instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury which can be severe and has led to deaths from acute liver failure. The onset of injury is typically within 1 to 8 weeks of starting therapy. The pattern of serum enzyme elevation at the time of presentation can be either hepatocellular or cholestatic; however, the injury tends to be cholestatic and can be prolonged. Immunoallergic and autoimmune features are not common. Several instances of acute liver injury associated with thalidomide therapy have occurred in patients with other apparent causes of liver disease or with preexisting chronic hepatitis B or C. If performed during the acute injury, liver biopsy shows hepatocellular necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, consistent with acute drug induced injury. In some instances there is bile duct injury and loss resulting in progressive cholestatic liver injury suggestive of vanishing bile duct syndrome. Thalidomide and its derivatives have also been implicated in causing an increased risk of graft-vs-host disease after autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). There appears to be cross reactivity to this complication among thalidomide and its two derivatives. Therapy usually requires discontinuation of the antineoplastic agent as well as treatment with high doses of corticosteroids and tacrolimus or sirolimus.",

Thalidomide was introduced in Germany and other countries in the 1960s as a sedative. It is one of the first medications known to cause birth defects in humans. It was prescribed to people who were pregnant to treat nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy. Thalidomide was not released in the United States until 1998. It has been used to treat several conditions, such as leprosy, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and complications from HIV infection. It is sold under the brand name Thalomid\u00ae.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. The product label for thalidomide recommends people who are pregnant not use this medication. However, the benefit of using thalidomide may outweigh possible risks. It is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. They can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.If you miss your period, get pregnant, have a positive pregnancy test, or have unusual menstrual bleeding while taking thalidomide, contact your healthcare providers right away.",

In healthy adults, it takes up to 2 days, on average, for most of the thalidomide to be gone from the body. It has been recommended that people stop using thalidomide 1 month before trying to get pregnant.Thalidomide can cause birth defects when taken early in pregnancy, often before a person knows that they are pregnant. It is recommended that 2 different and reliable methods of birth control be used if a person is taking thalidomide. It is very important that effective methods of birth control be used correctly and at all times. Thalidomide may lower how well oral contraceptives (birth control pills) work. The manufacturer of thalidomide developed the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program (formerly known as the S.T.E.P.S.\u00ae program) to help prevent thalidomide exposure in people who are pregnant. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about the 2 birth control methods you should use when taking thalidomide.",

In one controlled trial, the rate of venous thromboembolism was 22.5% in patients receiving thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone compared to 4.9% in patients receiving dexamethasone alone (p = 0.002). Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Instruct patients to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Consider thromboprophylaxis based on an assessment of individual patients' underlying risk factors.",

Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months; however, peripheral neuropathy following relatively short-term use has been reported. The correlation with cumulative dose is unclear. Symptoms may occur some time after thalidomide treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all.",

Sixteen (2/sex/dose group) and 32 (4/sex/dose group) dogs were euthanized and necropsied after 26 and 53 weeks of dosing, respectively. The remaining 8 animals (2/sex/group; high-dose and control groups) were dosed for 53 weeks, euthanized, and necropsied at 58 weeks after a 5-week recovery period. There were no deaths during the study. The only observed clinical signs attributable to thalidomide administration were green-colored urine, white-colored fecal residue presumed to be unchanged thalidomide, enlarged and/or blue coloration of female mammary tissue, and prolonged estrus. There were no thalidomide-related changes in body weights, food consumption, electrocardiography, ophthalmoscopy, neurological function, and endocrine function. The mostly slight and/or transient variations observed in some hematology and blood chemistry values of dosed dogs were considered to be toxicologically insignificant and were supported by the lack of histopathologic correlates. The only gross finding attributable to thalidomide was a yellow-green discoloration of the femur, rib, and/or calvarium that was observed at each euthanization interval including recovery. There was no microscopic correlate for this finding. No thalidomide-related microscopic changes were seen in any of the organs and tissues at 26 weeks. Mammary duct dilatation and/or glandular hyperplasia observed in females at 53 and 58 weeks and hepatic bile pigment exhibited by high-dose males at 53 weeks were microscopic changes considered to be thalidomide-related. There was no gross and histopathologic evidence of any tumors. In summary, thalidomide at up to 1000 mg/kg/day for 53 weeks did not induce any major systemic toxicity or tumors in dogs. The NOAEL was 200 mg/kg/day.",

In mice, mild/moderate centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed from 300 mg/kg/day in males (5-fold human exposure) and at 3000 mg/kg/day in females (9-fold human exposure). Increased liver weight was noted at 3000 mg/kg/day in males (13-fold human exposure) and females. In rats, decreased total and free T4 was observed from 300 mg/kg in males (10-fold human exposure) and from 30 mg/kg/day in females (5-fold human exposure). TSH levels were not evaluated. In female dogs, prolongation of the estrus cycle or no estrus, and a dose-related increase in severity of mammary duct dilatation and hyperplasia of the glandular epithelium was noted from 43 mg/kg/day (<1-fold human exposure). Mammary tissue findings were also observed following a 4-week drug-free period. In male dogs, accumulation of ductal bile plugs in canaliculi was seen at 1000 mg/kg/day (4-fold human exposure). Exposure margins were derived by comparing AUC0-t in animals with AUC0-24 in healthy volunteers administered a 200 mg dose of thalidomide.",

When the data were expressed as absolute values, there was no statistically significant difference in B cells, T cells or CD4 cells with treatment of thalidomide. Thalidomide treatment increased by 23% the number of CD4-CD8+ cells in the T cell subsets and decreased by 11% the number of NK1.1+CD3- cells at the highest dosage (150 mg/kg/day). The AFC response was increased by 37% and 42% for AFC/106 spleen cells (specific activity) and AFC/spleen (total spleen activity), respectively, at the highest dose (150 mg/kg/day) tested. Thalidomide treatment had no effect on serum IgM titers. A significant increase was seen in the CTL response at 1.5:1, 3:1 and 6:1 E:T ratios. No biologically significant effects were seen in either the NK cell activity or the MLR response. ... Host resistance to Listeria monocytogenes was not affected. In summary, thalidomide in doses of 30, 100 and 150 mg/kg, administered for 28 days by the intraperitoneal route, produced a slight increase in humoral and cellular immune indicators.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.1X10-14 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates thalidomide will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase thalidomide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Thalidomide absorbs UV light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, thalidomide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-16 atm-cu m/mole. Thalidomide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Closed Bottle test and the Manometric respiratory test, thalidomide exhibited less than 35% degradation in 28 days, indicating that biodegradation is a slow environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, thalidomide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound contains functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to thalidomide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where thalidomide is produced or used. Exposure to thalidomide among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug, an immunomodulator. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Therapeutic efficacy of combined administration of citric acid (CA) and N-(2-hydroxyethyl) ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA) was evaluated in decreasing blood and brain aluminum concentration and parameters indicative of hematological disorders and brain oxidative stress. Adult male wistar rats were exposed to drinking water containing 0.2% aluminum nitrate for 8 months and treated once daily for 5 consecutive days with CA (50 mg/kg, orally) or HEDTA (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) either individually or in combination. Aluminum exposure significantly inhibited blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase while increased zinc protoporphyrin confirming changed heme biosynthesis. Significant decrease in the level of glutathione S-transferase in various brain regions and an increase in whole brain thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels were also observed. Glutathione peroxidase activity showed a significant increase in cerebellum of aluminum exposed rats. Most of the above parameters responded moderately to the individual treatment with CA and HEDTA, but significantly reduced blood and brain aluminum burden. However, more pronounced beneficial effects on some of the above described parameters were observed when CA and HEDTA were administered concomitantly. Blood and brain aluminum concentration however, showed no further decline on combined treatment over the individual effect with HEDTA or CA. /Investigators/ conclude that in order to achieve an optimum effect of chelation, combined administration of CA and HEDTA might be preferred. However, further work is needed before a final recommendation could be made. /HEDTA/",

The benefits or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer saftey standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Trisodium (2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetate is found on List D. Case No: 4037; Pesticide type: fungicide, herbicide, antimicrobial; Case Status: None of the active ingredients in the case are being supported for reregistration by their registrants. All are unsupported, or some are unsupported and some are cancelled. Cases described as \"unsupported\" generally are being processed for cancellation.; Active ingredient (AI): trisodium (2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetate; AI Status:  Registrants of the pesticide have not made or honored a commitment to seek reregistration, conduct the necessary studies, or pay the requisite fees, or they have asked EPA to cancel their product registrations. Unless some other interested party supports them, products containing the pesticide will be cancelled.",

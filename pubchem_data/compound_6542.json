                        "Description": "A chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols and numbers. PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Rhinorrhea and a sensation of tightness in the chest are common in inhalation exposures. 4. Blurring or dimness of vision, miosis (with fixed pinpoint pupils), tearing, ciliary muscle spasm, loss of accommodation, and ocular pain. None of these eye effects are diagnostically dependable except in primary ocular exposures. Indeed, mydriasis is sometimes seen, probably due to sympatho-adrenal discharge. /Parathion/",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The spectrum of effects depends on the agent, dosage, species, tissue, and experimental or physiological conditions. All of the alkaloids of ergot significantly increase the motor activity of the uterus. After small doses contractions are increased in force or frequency, or both, but are followed by a normal degree of relaxation. As the dose is increased, contractions become more forceful and prolonged, resting tonus is markedly increased, and sustained contracture can result.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It also causes uterine contractions to aid in expulsion of retained products of conception after a missed abortion (miscarriage in which all or part of the fetus remains in the uterus) and to help deliver the placenta after childbirth. The drug is currently prepared via reaction of (+)-lysergic acid with L-(+)-aminobutanol, using different coupling reagents, and is available under the name Methergine as tablets or injection (IM or IV) or in liquid form to be taken orally.

Therefore a prospective study was designed to follow the influence of MEM on post-partum PRL levels and milk production. MEM was given orally to 30 post-partum women from day 1 to day 7 in a daily dose of 0.6 mg. Thirty untreated women served as control. PRL plasma levels and milk yield were compared at day 1, 3 and 7. PRL levels were significantly lower in the treated group at day 7 (P less than 0.01), while the difference at day 3 was statistically not significant. Milk yield was significantly reduced at day 3 (P less than 0.05) and day 7 (P less than 0.01). These results indicate PRL inhibiting properties of MEM resulting consequently in reduced lactation.",

MEM was given orally to 30 post-partum women from day 1 to day 7 in a daily dose of 0.6 mg. Thirty untreated women served as control. PRL plasma levels and milk yield were compared at day 1, 3 and 7. PRL levels were significantly lower in the treated group at day 7 (P less than 0.01), while the difference at day 3 was statistically not significant. Milk yield was significantly reduced at day 3 (P less than 0.05) and day 7 (P less than 0.01). These results indicate PRL inhibiting properties of MEM resulting consequently in reduced lactation.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

In one study, slight degenerative changes were observed in the liver and kidneys of rats chronically exposed to 2,4,5- trichlorophenol in their diet. EPA has classified 2,4,5-trichlorophenol as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In this study, damage parameters [levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and total glutathione; activity of glutathione reductase (GR); activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD); levels of adenine nucleotides and adenine energy charge (AEC)] were measured in human erythrocytes exposed in vitro to 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) and its metabolite 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (2,4,5-TCP). Both 2,4,5-T and 2,4,5-TCP decreased the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) in erythrocytes in comparison to the control, but did not significantly change the total glutathione (2GSH + GSSG). This suggests that GSH concentration decreases concomitantly with an increase in oxidized glutathione (GSSG). 2,4,5-TCP at 100 ppm significantly decreased catalase and SOD activities. 2,4,5-T and 2,4,5-TCP did not significantly change the activity of glutathione reductase. 2,4,5-TCP decreased the level of ATP and increased the content of ADP and AMP, indicating a fall in AEC. 2,4,5-T and 2,4,5-TCP significantly changed the erythrocyte morphology. All these data are evidence of oxidative stress in erythrocytes incubated with 2,4,5-T and 2,4,5-TCP; the stress appears to be more intense in the case of 2,4,5-TCP.",

Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is found on List B.

This herbicide consisted of a mixture of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), as well as small amounts of a contaminant, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxine (TCDD), better know as dioxin /formed during the synthesis of 2,4,5-T because of reaction between two molecules of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol/, Over the years, a large number of adverse health effects have been attributed to Agent Orange exposure. A 2002 Institute of Medicine study concluded that among Vietnam veterans, there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate an association between the herbicide exposure and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, soft tissue sarcomas, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Hodgkin disease and chloracne.",

                                                    "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: 2, 4, 5-Trichlorophenol (2, 4, 5-TCP) comes in the form of colorless needles from alcohols or in gray flakes.  It was formerly used as a fungicide, bactericide, biocide; intermediate in production of herbicides, in adhesives as a preservative in polyvinyl acetate emulsions; in the automotive industry to preserve rubber gaskets; in textiles to preserve emulsions used in the rayon industry; in cooling towers; paper and pulp mill systems; hide and leather processing; on swimming pool related surfaces; sickroom equipment; and food processing plants and equipment.  2,4,5-TCP is not registered for current use in the U.S., but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY:  In the eye, trichlorophenols induce conjunctival irritation and sometimes corneal injury and iritis. dusts are irritating to nose and pharynx.  Dermatoses, including photoallergic contact dermatitis, have been reported in man after exposure to 2,4,5-TCP, these include papulofollicular lesions, comedones, sebaceous cysts, and marked hyperkeratosis.  During the clean-up following explosions during 2,4,5-TCP manufacture, chloracne was generally severe, and many cases had some signs or symptoms or lab abnormalities indicating systemic toxicity.  Systemic effects of trichlorophenols presumably resemble phenol.  Symptoms from upper airways and chest were more common among 7 subjects exposed to trichlorophenol than in control subjects (60% and 10%).  The findings suggest an irritating effect on the lung of trichlorophenol, and it cannot be excluded that long-term exposure may produce pulmonary fibrosis.  2,4,5-TCP has not been shown to have a teratogenic effect.  In a study of workers exposed to 2, 4, 5-TCP 10 years earlier, neither chromosomal aberrations nor sister chromatid exchanges were observed.  Exposure to chlorophenols has been shown to cause an increased incidence of carcinomas including a significant trend observed for total gastrointestinal system cancer related to work in 2,4,5-TCP and 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)-propionic-acid production areas.  ANIMAL STUDIES: Restlessness and  increased rate of respiration followed by rapidly developing motor weakness. tremors, clonic convulsions (induced by noise or touch), dyspnea, and coma continue until death.  D-amino acid oxidase and heart muscle flavoproteins were inhibited by 2,4,5-TCP in vitro. In rat and rabbit hyperpyrexia from injections of trichlorophenols has been reported.  In a 98-day feeding study in rats, 0.3 g and 1 g/kg body weight/day doses of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol retarded weight gain and caused diuresis, mild centrilobular changes in the liver, moderate degenerative changes in the convoluted tubules of the kidneys and early proliferative changes in the kidney interstitial tissue.  Slight proliferation of bile ducts and early portal cirrhosis were also observed.  The severity of effects was dose related.  No significant effects were observed with doses of 100 mg/kg body weight/day (0.1% in diet) or less.  2,4,5-TCP given by gavage to pregnant mice in single doses of 800-900 mg/kg or multiple doses of 250-300 mg/kg caused no significant fetal effects and the results obtained in Hydra attenuata and whole embryo culture assays suggest that chlorinated phenols are not potent teratogens.  Hydra attenuata and whole embryo culture studies demonstrated a linear relationship between toxicity and the degree of chlorine substitution with pentachlorophenol > 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol > 2,3,5-TCP > 3,5-dichlorophenol > 4-chlorophenol > phenol. The developmental hazard index A/D ratios from the Hydra attenuata assay were approximately 1 for all of the chemicals tested. Findings from the whole embryo culture assay indicated similar results based on growth, gross morphology, and DNA and protein content of embryos. The results obtained in the Hydra attenuata and whole embryo culture assays suggest that the chlorinated phenols are not potent teratogens.  3-Chlorophenol, 4-chlorophenol, 2,3,6-, 2,4,5-, 2,4,6-TCP, 4-chloro-2-methylphenol, and 4-chloro-3-methylphenol produced mutagenic activity at least in one tester strain (TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA104) in the Ames test.  The induction of forward mutation to 6-thioguanine resistance in V79 Chinese hamster cells by six different chlorophenols was examined.  Each of the chlorophenols tested reduced the plating efficiency in a dose dependent manner including 2,4,5-TCP at doses of 6.25 to 50 ug/mL. This cytotoxic effect can be attributed to the ability of pentachlorophenol and other chlorophenols to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation.  ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Chlorinated phenols represent a major component of hazardous oily and wood-preserving wastes that are widely distributed in chemical dumpsites throughout the United States.  The acute toxicity of some chlorinated phenols, catechols, and cresols, incl 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, to trout was determined. The lowest lethal concn of the cmpd studied was 0.20 ppm caused by pentachlorophenols, tetrachlorophenols, and trichlorophenols.  The residue of chlorophenol in larval tissue was measured and the correlation to the concentration on larval mortality was highly significant in the growth test.  In the emergence test, however, mortality was low (3-13%) at all concentrations.  2, 4, 5-TCP did not affect larval growth at the concentrations used. The concentration of 2, 4, 5-TCP in the whole larvae after the 10-day exposure was proportional to sediment concentration.",

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

In contrast, no such synergism was observed for the combination of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol with the Cu(II)-bis(bathophenanthroline disulfonate) complex [Cu(II)(BPS)2] which has a chemical structure similar to Cu(II)(OP)2, except for the net charge. The synergism observed for 2,4,5-trichlorophenol and Cu(II)(OP)2 was found to be due to the neutralization of their opposite charge and formation of a lipophilic ternary complex which facilitated copper transport into the bacterial cells.",

Symptoms from upper airways and chest were more common among exposed than in control subjects (60% and 10%).

Incr elastic recoil pressure of the lung and x-ray signs of lung tissue involvement were noticed in 2 subjects. The findings suggest an irritating effect on the lung of trichlorophenol, and it cannot be excluded that long-term exposure may produce pulmonary fibrosis. /Trichlorophenol/",

However, not much is known about the effects of, e.g., low temperatures and parasite infections on the toxicokinetics of organic hydrophobic chemicals. Here we studied the accumulation and depuration of [(14)C]2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP) and [(3)H]benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) in the sediment-dwelling freshwater clam Pisidium amnicum. Experiments were made in October (+15 \u00b0C), April (+4 \u00b0C), and July (+15 \u00b0C) both with uninfected clams and clams infected with Bunodera luciopercae (Trematoda). The accumulation rate for both chemicals was slower at 4 \u00b0C than at 15 \u00b0C. The depuration of TCP was biphasic, and the slowest depuration occurred at 4 \u00b0C. For BaP, the depuration was very slow and monophasic at all temperatures. The highest BCFs for both chemicals were found in July at 15 \u00b0C. Surprisingly, the BCFs for TCP were higher in April at 4 \u00b0C than in October at 15 \u00b0C. For BaP, no steady-state was reached in April. Differences in chemical toxicokinetics between the infected and uninfected clams were only minor. However, for both chemicals a trend of slightly lower BCFs in the infected clams was found. In conclusion, low temperatures modify the toxicokinetics of organic chemicals in P. amnicum and the effects depend on hydrophobicity of the chemical. The effects of parasites on toxicokinetics seem to be small.",

In addition, we measured the residue of chlorophenol in larval tissue and made an attempt to relate it with the observed adverse biological responses. The larvae were exposed individually to avoid density-dependent effects of mortality on food ration and growth of the surviving larvae. In the growth test, mortality was low at sediment concentrations </=193 micromol TCP/kg, but it increased sharply at the higher concentrations being 37 and 94% at 334 and 441 micromol/kg DW, respectively. The effect of sediment TCP concentration on larval mortality was highly significant (10-day LC50 337 micromol TCP/kg dry sediment) in the growth test. In the emergence test, however, mortality was low (3-13%) at all concentrations. TCP did not affect larval growth at the concentrations used. The concentration of TCP in the whole larvae after the 10-day exposure was proportional to sediment concentration, being at highest 160 micromol/kg fresh weight. When the average body residues of TCP were below 80 micromol/kg, mortality was low, but it increased when the body residue approached 100 micromol/kg. After the 10-day exposure, the body residue, at which 50% of the larvae survived (CBR50) was 113 micromol/g. TCP exposure accelerated larval development and the midges exposed to 171 and 324 micromol TCP/kg emerged earlier than those in the other concentrations or in the control sediment. In natural environments, sediment-associated chlorophenolics are probably not a major environmental problem to benthic fauna because concentrations similar to that which we observed to cause adverse effects to C. riparius (>60 mg/kg dry sediment) are rare.",

Its formation as a breakdown product on the herbicide 2,4,5-T resulted in its direct release to the environment. 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol may be released to the environment as a result of the chlorination of phenol-containing wastewater or drinking water. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.0075 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4,5-trichlorophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4,5-trichlorophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.8 days. If released to soil, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol is expected to have high to slight mobility based upon Koc values of 89-2300. The pKa of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol is 7.43, indicating that this compound will exist partially in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the anion form from moist soil is not expected because anions do not volatilize. Volatilization of the neutral form from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is expected to biodegrade in soils based on a biodegradation half-life of about 15 days in a soil slurry under aerobic conditions. If released into water, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is expected to biodegrade in water based on biodegradation half-lives of 23 days in aerobic sediment, 130 days in anaerobic sediment and 690 days in river water. Volatilization from water surfaces of the anion form is not expected to be an important fate process because ions do not volatilize. Volatilization of the neutral form from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for the neutral form for a model river and model lake are 6.8 and 240 days, respectively. 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is expected to undergo photolysis in surface waters based on an aqueous photolysis half-life of 1 hour when irradiated with light at environmentally relevant wavelengths. BCFs of 121-825 in carp and 1900 in fathead minnow suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure may be through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4,5-trichlorophenol is used or where chlorine containing compounds are employed for bleaching or disinfection purposes. The general population may be exposed to 2,4,5-trichlorophenol through the ingestion of contaminated water sources. (SRC)",

Volatilization of neutral 2,4,5-trichlorophenol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure, 0.0075 mm Hg(7), and water solubility, 1200 mg/L(8). 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(7). This compound is expected to biodegrade in soils with a biodegradation half-life of about 15 days in a soil slurry under aerobic conditions(9).",

Volatilization of the neutral form from water surfaces is expected(6) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.0075 mm Hg(7), and water solubility, 1200 mg/L(8). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(6), volatilization half-lives for the neutral form from a model river and model lake are 32 and 240 days, respectively(SRC). 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(6). 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is expected to undergo photolysis in surface waters based on an aqueous photolysis half-life of 1 hour(9) when irradiated with light at environmentally relevant wavelengths. According to a classification scheme(10), BCFs of 121-825 in carp(11) and 1900 in fathead minnow(12), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is expected to biodegrade in water based on biodegradation half-lives of 23 days in aerobic sediment(13), 130 days in anaerobic sediment(14) and 690 days in river water(13).",

Mixed microbial cultures isolated from toluene and phenol activated sludge, resulted in 50% biodegradation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol in 2 days(3). 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol, present at 50 mg/L, took >47 and >72 days for complete degradation when added to 2 different soil suspensions(4). 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol was aerobically degraded 72% and 9% in 80 days in non-sterile and sterile clay loam, respectively(5). Microbial degradation, volatilization, and photodecomposition were ruled out in the sterile soil indicating that other mechanisms contribute to degradation(5). An aerobic biodegradation half-life of 23 days was determined for 2,4,5-trichlorophenol from a river die-away test(6). Biodegradation half-life (measured by loss of UV absorbance) for 10 ug/L 2,4,5-trichlorophenol added to a soil suspension was 15 days(7).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6.8 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2).  2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is expected to undergo photolysis in surface waters based on aqueous photolysis half-lives of 1 hour(3) and 40 minutes(4) when irradiated with light at environmentally relevant wavelengths. When exposed to sunlight in natural water at pH 7 for 150 minutes, degradation products of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol include 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorocyclopentadiene, 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone, 5-chloro-4-cyclohexene-1-one, 2-chlorophenol and 4,4-dihydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetrachlorodiphenyl ether(5). Under other exposure conditions 2,5-dichlorophenol, 2,5-dichloro-1,4-hydroquinone, 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone and 2-chloro-1,4-benzoquinone were formed(5).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

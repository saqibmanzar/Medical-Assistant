PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

This is converted to estriol by the placenta. If levels of \"unconjugated estriol\" are abnormally low in a pregnant woman, this may indicate a problem with the development of the child. The drug interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estriol upon the target cell. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary.",

Biologic response is initiated when estrogen binds to a ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor resulting in a conformational change that leads to gene transcription through specific estrogen response elements (ERE) of target gene promoters; subsequent activation or repression of the target gene is mediated through 2 distinct transactivation domains (ie, AF-1 and AF-2) of the receptor. The estrogen receptor also mediates gene transcription using different response elements (ie, AP-1) and other signal pathways. Recent advances in the molecular pharmacology of estrogen and estrogen receptors have resulted in the development of selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, clomiphene, raloxifene, tamoxifen, toremifene), agents that bind and activate the estrogen receptor but that exhibit tissue-specific effects distinct from estrogen. Tissue-specific estrogen-agonist or -antagonist activity of these drugs appears to be related to structural differences in their estrogen receptor complex (eg, specifically the surface topography of AF-2 for raloxifene) compared with the estrogen (estradiol)-estrogen receptor complex. A second estrogen receptor also has been identified, and existence of at least 2 estrogen receptors (ER-alpha, ER-beta) may contribute to the tissue-specific activity of selective modulators. While the role of the estrogen receptor in bone, cardiovascular tissue, and the CNS continues to be studied, emerging evidence indicates that the mechanism of action of estrogen receptors in these tissues differs from the manner in which estrogen receptors function in reproductive tissue. /Estrogen General Statement/",

Estrogens reduce LDL-cholesterol and increase HDL-cholesterol concentrations in a dose-related manner. The decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentrations associated with estrogen therapy appears to result from increased LDL catabolism, while the increase in triglyceride concentrations is caused by increased production of large, triglyceride-rich, very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs); changes in serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations appear to result principally from an increase in the cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1 content of HDL2- and a slight increase in HDL3-cholesterol. /Estrogen General Statement/",

When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estriol upon the target cell. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary.",

Plasma luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), progesterone (Pg) and prolactin (Prl) were measured during a treatment and a control cycle every second or third day. Further 3, 6 or 20 mg estriol was administered in a single dose to 5 women and plasma Prl, unconjugated and conjugated estriol (E3) measured over 24 hr at 2-3 intervals. In 2 experiments with 20 mg E3, blood samples were taken more frequently, over 6 hr. When 20 mg E2 was administered daily, 2 of the 7 young women had anovulatory cycles. The mean plasma E2 was lower during the follicular and ovulatory phases (P less than 0.025) and mean plasma LH was higher (P less than 0.005) during the luteal phase, when E3 was given. Because of the 2 anovulatory cycles the mean Pg value during the luteal phase was lower (P less than 0.05) during treatment. There was a slight decrease in mean Prl in 5 out of 6 women (P less than 0.0005), but in only 1 woman was this decrease substantial (from a mean value of 27.6-18.9 ng/mL; P less than 0.01). When 6 or 20 mg E3 was administered orally in the morning a significant negative correlation (P less than 0.01) between plasma Prl and unconjugated E3 was found. The correlation coefficient was highest (r = -0.74) with 6 mg E3. When 3 mg was administered no obvious effect on Prl section was seen. However, when results from all experiments with identical time schedules were pooled (two with 3 mg, two with 6 mg and one with 20 mg E3) and the mean values for plasma Prl calculated and compared with the mean values obtained in 7 control experiments, it was found that E3 administration in the morning almost abolishes the Prl rise during the following night. There was a statistically significant (P less than 0.0125) decrease in the difference between the maximum value during the night and the minimum value during the day. The minimum value was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) and the maximum value significantly lower (P less than 0.025) after E3 treatment, compared to the control values. It is concluded that long-term administration of 20 mg E3 usually has only a slight but significant decreasing effect on mean plasma Prl concentration measured in the morning, before the next dose is taken.",

This risk was independent of other known risk factors for endometrial carcinoma and appeared to depend on duration and dosage of estrogen therapy. While there appears to be no increased risk of endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women receiving estrogen therapy for less than 1 year, prolonged estrogen therapy may be associated with an increased risk of such carcinoma. The risk of endometrial carcinoma reportedly is increased 2- to 12-fold in postmenopausal women receiving unopposed estrogen therapy compared with those not receiving estrogens; such increased risk may depend on dosage and duration of therapy and may be 15- to 24-fold higher in women receiving long-term (5 years or more) estrogen therapy. Limited data indicate that a substantial increased risk of endometrial carcinoma may persist for up to 15 years following discontinuance of estrogen therapy. Because of the increased risk of endometrial carcinoma associated with prolonged estrogen therapy, patients receiving prolonged treatment with the drugs should be evaluated at least twice yearly to reassess the need for continued therapy. Results of several studies indicate that when progestins are used concomitantly with estrogen replacement therapy, the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma is reduced substantially. In a randomized, controlled, multicenter study in postmenopausal women, endometrial hyperplasia occurred in 20 or 1% or less of women receiving estrogen therapy alone or in conjunction with progestins, respectively. In the WHI study, the incidence of endometrial carcinoma in women receiving hormone replacement therapy (conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg in conjunction with medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg daily) was similar to the incidence in women receiving placebo. /Estrogen General Statement/",

In the WHI study, the risk of invasive breast cancer was 26% higher in women receiving HRT (conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg in conjunction with medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg daily) compared with those receiving placebo; the estimated hazard ratio for breast cancer was 1.26. While there have been several observational studies evaluating the risk of breast cancer in women receiving HRT, conclusions are limited by healthy-user bias; variations in specific preparations, dosage, and duration of therapy; and differences in the methods used to determine breast cancer end points. In aggregate, breast cancer incidence is slightly increased among current (relative risk: 1.21-1.4) or long-term (longer than 5 years) recipients (relative risk: 1.23-1.35) compared with nonusers. Based on these findings, recommendations on the appropriate use of hormone therapy have been revised. Because the risks of hormone therapy exceed the benefits for the prevention of chronic diseases in postmenopausal women, experts state that ERT or HRT should not be used for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women. The American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and manufacturers recommend that hormone therapy not be used to prevent heart disease in healthy women (primary prevention) or to protect women with preexisting heart disease (secondary prevention). ACOG, FDA, and the manufacturers also recommend that women receiving hormone therapy solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis consider alternative therapy (eg, alendronate, raloxifene, risedronate). /Estrogen General Statement/",

Some estriol precursors were less inhibitory of breast cancer development among 23 other estrogens and androgens, progestins and glucocorticoids tested. More frequent or lower estriol doses than 100--200 ug/kg/24 hr every 2 months were less inhibitory of breast carcinogenesis. No other types of neoplasms were reduced in incidence by estriol implants, which also reduced uterine weights by 20--25%. Intermittent substitution of estriol for estrone or estradiol in the nuclear receptor complexes of target cells probably accounts for these observations, which resemble the effect of castration in reducing breast cancer incidence. ...",

It is usually the predominant estrogenic metabolite found in urine. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.9X10-11 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates estriol will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase estriol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Estriol irradiated with a xenon arc lamp exhibited a photodegradation half-life of 2.9 hours in river water and 38.2 hours in air-saturated purified water, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, estriol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. Estriol is not expected to  volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, estriol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated BCF values of 19 and 50 suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to estriol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where estriol is produced or used. Exposure to estriol via ingestion will occur when administered drugs containing this compound. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to estriol at well below the therapeutic dose via ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

This technique is particularly useful to study aromatic, conjugated, and other substances containing a pi bond.  Modern ultraviolet spectrophotometers also cover the visible light range, in which case the technique is called ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Urine was periodically hydrolyzed and analyzed for the three metabolites pentachlorophenol, 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorobenzene-1,4-diol and pentachlorothiophenol (derived from the mercapturate). The combined urinary excretion of these was greater in females than males, especially during the first 10 weeks. Pentachlorothiophenol was particularly high in female urine. After 103 days this metabolite was slightly less in female feces than in male's but free hepatic pentachlorothiophenol was 3.6-fold greater. Although total 24 hr excretions of metabolites were higher by females than males and after 7 daily doses of HCB, a difference in this respect was not conclusively proven. However, total pentachlorothiophenol excretion was always significantly greater by females. The male/female ratios for pentachlorophenol and pentachlorothiophenol in bile were identical to those for feces. Excretion of metabolites by both adult males and females was stimulated by pretreatment with diethylstilbestrol (DES). No sex differences in metabolism were observed with immature rats.",

PTCP is replaced by 2,2'-dibenzamidodiphenyldisulfide (DBD) which is less toxic and reacts similarly. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: PCTP did not produce skin irritation in human subjects after 24-hours exposure. ANIMAL STUDIES: Following inhalation exposure to 1 mg/L PCTP dust for 1 hr in both rats and rabbits, effects of the test substances were slightly irritating to the respiratory tract. The rabbits seemed to be more sensitive. Rats, a guinea pig, a rabbit and a cat were exposed to 2050 mg evaporated pentachlorothiophenol for 4 hours. Effects included: irritation of the mucous membranes in all animals (with the exception of the rats); at the following day the cat and rabbit still had conjunctivitis. PCTP did not produce any effects in dietary studies in rats. PCTP did not produced any developmental effects in chicken embryo. Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 test was negative with and without metabolic activation. PCTP acted as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in rat liver mitochondria. After administration of hexachlorobenzene rats excrete sulfur-containing conjugates from which PCTP can be split off.",

Pentachlorothiophenol can be formed in the environment as a soil biotransformation metabolite of the fungicide quintozene (pentachloronitrobenzene). Pentachlorothiophenol has also been identified as a plant and animal metabolite of both pentachloronitrobenzene and hexachlorobenzene. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.1X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pentachlorothiophenol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pentachlorothiophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 115 days. Particulate-phase pentachlorothiophenol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. By analogy to similar compounds, pentachlorothiophenol may absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pentachlorothiophenol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 6,200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. A single biodegradation result noted 0% biodegradation of pentachlorothiophenol using a domestic sewage inoculum and a 30-day incubation period. If released into water, pentachlorothiophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 hours and 9.6 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 150 days when adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 3,700 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to pentachlorothiophenol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pentachlorothiophenol is produced or use. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to pentachlorothiophenol via ingestion of fish, animals or plants containing pentachlorothiophenol as a metabolite of the fungicide quintozene or hexachlorobenzene. Pentachlorothiophenol is reported to be a metabolite of hexachlorobenzene in humans. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(2), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 hours and 9.6 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 150 days when adsorption is considered(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3,700(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 5.91(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). A single biodegradation result noted 0% biodegradation of pentachlorothiophenol using a domestic sewage inoculum and a 30-day incubation period(6). Pentachlorothiophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Thus the poisons uncouple phosphorylation from oxidation. Free energy from the electron transport chain then converts to more body heat. As body temp rises, heat-dissipating mechanisms are overcome and metabolism is speeded. More adenosine diphosphate and other substrates accumulate, and these substrates stimulate the electron transport chain further. The electron transport chain responds by using up more and more available oxygen (increasing oxygen demand) in an effort to produce adenosine triphosphate but much of the free energy generated is liberated as still more body heat. Oxygen demand quickly overcomes oxygen supply, and energy reserves become depleted. /Chlorophenols/",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The cohort consisted of 1,932 male workers of a large paper, pulp, and sawmill factory. The workers were divided into three categories: comparisons, those subjected to exposure of airborne dust in proximity, and those who were dermally exposed to chemically treated lumber. All subjects answered a questionnaire on past and present health history, personal and life style characteristics, and occupational history. All workers also underwent a limited physical examination to measure height, weight, and blood pressure. Blood was sampled, and a number of clinical indices were measured. Concentrations of pentachlorophenate and tetrachlorophenate and the ratio of pentachlorophenate to tetrachlorophenate in urine were determined. Concentrations of blood hemoglobin among the three groups were essentially the same. Hematocrit and leukocyte counts were lower in the exposed groups and showed a dose/response relationship with exposure. Only the data on hematocrit was statistically significant for the dermal exposure group. Other serum clinical parameters showed no dose/response relationships. Erythrocytes were more common in the urine of exposed workers and were significant with a dose/response relationship only to the heavily exposed group. Concentrations of chlorophenates and pentachlorophenate/tetrachlorophenate ratios in urine were twice as high in the dermal exposure group. It was concluded that further studies are necessary to adequately correlate the changes in hematocrit and urinary excretion to the degree of chlorophenate exposure among workers. /Tetrachlorophenate/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.23X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 58 days. If released to soil, 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 6300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation in soil may be important. In a laboratory test using a soil inoculum, 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol persisted for more than 72 days; another study reported that it disappeared from soil to a large degree in 4 weeks. If released into water, 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based on Koc values ranging from 6040 to 7690 in river sediment, lake sediment and aquifer material. Volatilization of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon the estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 43 and 320 days, respectively. However, a pKa of 5.22 for 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol indicates that 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol will not volatilize from water as it will exist predominately in the ionic form under environmental pHs. BCFs ranging from 25 to 200 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to high. Biodegradation of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol has been observed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. 7% BODT was reached over a period of 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum. 99.6% mean removal of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was observed over a period of 235 days in an aerobic fluidized-bed reactor. 74% removal of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was observed after 32 days anaerobic incubation in mixed digested sludge. Occupational exposure to 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol may have occured through inhalation of vapors and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was used or where chlorophenol wood preservatives were used.

Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 43 and 320 days, respectively(3,SRC). However, a pKa of 5.22 for 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol(6) indicates that 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol will not significantly volatilize from water as it will exist predominately in the ionic form under environmental pHs(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), BCFs ranging from 25 to 200(8,9), suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to high(SRC). 51% (89%) disappearance of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was observed following 6 (24) hours irradiation (> or = 285 nm) in a 1:1 (v/v) water:acetonitrile mixture; 2,3,4-and 2,3,6-trichlorophenol were identified as photoproducts in the n-hexane extracts when the pH was changed to <1(10). 2,3,4,6-Tetrachlorophenol, concn 100 mg/l, reached 7% of its theoretical BOD over 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(9). High-rate operation of an aerobic fluidized-bed reactor resulted in a 99.6% mean removal of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol over a period of 235 days(11). 74% removal of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was observed after 32 days anaerobic incubation in mixed digested sludge(12).",

An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Another study reported that 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol disappeared from soil to a large degree in 4 weeks(6). Fungi that attack conifer heartwood(2) as well as those found in litter shavings in chicken houses(3) have been reported to degrade 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol. A bacterium acclimated to pentachlorophenol was able to also utilize 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol as a growth substrate(4). The removal of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol in kraft pulp mill/bleach plant effluent was far superior in an anaerobic reactor (83% with a 12 hr retention time) than in an aerated lagoon (33%, retention time 14 days) or an activated sludge plant (25%)(5). 2,3,4,6-Tetrachlorophenol, concn 100 mg/l, reached 7% of its theoretical BOD over 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(7). High-rate operation (5h; 350 to 480 mg chlorophenol/l/d) of an aerobic fluidized-bed reactor resulted in a 99.6% mean removal of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol over a period of 235 days(8). 100% removal of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was observed in aerobic enrichment cultures following 8 days incubation(8). Over a 407-day study period, 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was detected in the effluent of a sewage treatment plant in Karkola, Finland employing activated sludge at a mean concn of 6.4 ug/l; mean concns of 13,000 and 1.4 ug/l were detected in the fed groundwater and dewatered sludge, respectively(9).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The Koc of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol is estimated as approximately 6300(SRC), using a log Kow of 4.45(2) and a regression-derived equation(3,SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol is expected to be immobile in soil(SRC). In natural waters of low ionic strength and pH below approximately 6.4, the adsorption is dominated by the partitioning of the undissociated phenol between the aqueous phase and the organic phase contained in the sediment. However, at higher pH's, the contribution of the phenolate ion cannot be neglected(1). There is strong evidence that the adsorption of the phenolate species is also predominately a partitioning between the aqueous phase and organic matter in the sorbent and is dependent on the ionic strength of the aqueous phase(1). An equilibrium partition coefficient (Kp) of 1.8 was determined in batch equilibrium experiments using soil and groundwater (pH 10) from Alkali Lake, OR(7). In a laboratory experiment, 40% of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol sorbed to Weser estuary (Germany) sediment after 21 hr incubation at 14.5 \u00b0C; 65% was desorbed from the loaded sediment after another 21 hr(5). In contrast the partition ratios of 2,3,4,6- and/or 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenol between sediment/water and suspended matter/water from the Weser estuary were 38 and 6.3, respectively(5). In the Rhine River (The Netherlands) the median sediment to water ratio of tetrachlorophenol was 24(6). Log Kom values ranging from 1.275 to 2.750 were measured for 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol in 14 different soil and sediment samples; mean log Kom for anionic 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was 2.431(8). Freundlich sorption coefficients of 2.173, 6.373, 2.203, and 6.392 were measured in quartz (pH 7.5), calcite (pH 7.2), kaolinite (pH 7.0), and montmorillonite (pH 5.3), respectively(9). Sorption of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol was negligible to two surface soils containing 2.8 and 2.1% organic matter, and in samples of deeper sediment layers, consisting of 92 to 98% clay and silt and 0.5 to 8.4% organic matter; a Kd value of 16.7 was measured in a surface soil sample containing 12.2% organic matter(10). Kf values of 95 and 85 were determined in Holten soil (6.1% organic matter and 2.4% clay) and Kooyenburg soil (3.7% organic matter and 1.4% clay), respectively)(11).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol is expected to volatilize slowly from water surfaces(3,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the estimated volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 43 days(3,SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 320 days(3,SRC). A pKa of 5.22 for 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol(4) indicates that 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol will not volatilize from water or moist soil as it will exist predominately in the ionic form under environmental pHs(SRC). 2,3,4,6-Tetrachlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based on a vapor pressure of 4.23X10-3 mm Hg(1).",

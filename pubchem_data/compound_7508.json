When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Aldehydes can react with air to give first peroxo acids, and ultimately carboxylic acids.

The sensory irritation response in these animals was quantified by measuring respiratory rate depression in a head-only inhalation chamber in naive (nonpretreated) animals, the concentration eliciting a 50% decrease in respiratory rate (RD50) was 23 ppm or less for unsaturated aliphatic aldehydes. For cyclic and saturated aliphatic aldehydes, the RD50 ranged from 600 to 1000 ppm and 3000 to 6800 ppm, respectively. Formaldehyde pretreatment resulted in cross tolerance only with acetaldehyde (RD50 increased 3.5-fold) and acrolein (RD50 increased 5-fold the development of cross tolerance following HCHO pretreatment is not a general phenomenon.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.59 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibutylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dibutylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours. If released to soil, dibutylamine is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 825. The pKa of dibutylamine is 11.39, indicating that this compound will exist in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because the cation is not expected to volatilize. Dibutylamine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, dibutylamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. In a screening study, dibutylamine completely degraded within 14 days at 10 ppm with both an activated sludge and freshwater sediment inoculum. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process since this compound is expected to exist in the protonated form at environmental pH. An estimated BCF of 30 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to dibutylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dibutylamine is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to dibutylamine via ingestion of food. (SRC)",

A pKa value of 11.39(4) indicates that the protonated form of dibutylamine will be the dominant species in moist soil surfaces and cations generally adsorb strongly to soils. Volatilization of dibutylamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process since the cation is not expected to volatilize. The potential for volatilization of dibutylamine from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 2.59 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5). 94-97% of the theoretical BOD was achieved for dibutylamine using an activated sludge inoculum during a 4 week incubation period(6).",

Vapor-phase dibutylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours(SRC), from its rate constant of 8.98X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Dibutylamine is not expected to directly photolyze due to the lack of absorption in the environmental UV spectrum(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

BOD values obtained during this time period indicated that mineralization was essentially complete(1). River mud bacteria and activated sludge were inhibited by 50 and 100 ppm dibutylamine, respectively(1). In another study that utilized 100 ppm of dibutylamine and an activated sludge inoculum, no oxygen consumption was observed until about three days when the BOD increased sharply to about 30% of theoretical biological oxygen demand(2). Another screening test resulted in >90% degradation in 9 days including a 4 day lag period(3). While low concns of the free diamine were degraded in 10 hours by acclimated mixed cultures, only 25% of the dibutylamine adsorbed on bentonite clay was degraded in this time(5). The sorbed diamine degraded in 2 days(5). The rate of degradation of the sorbed molecule does not depend on its desorption rate, but rather may be due to restricted access by microorganisms(5). Under anaerobic conditions with high nitrate loads (denitrification conditions), dibutylamine shows little tendency to form nitrosamines(4). 94-97% of the theoretical BOD was achieved for dibutylamine using an activated sludge during a 4 week incubation period(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Please note that obsolete codes are added in this classification for completeness purposes, as they are still in use. Any obsolete codes are annotated as such.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Cephalosporins inhibit bacterial septum and cell wall synthesis, probably by action of membrane-bound transpeptidase enzymes. This prevents cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains, which is necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. Also, cell division and growth are inhibited, and elongation of susceptible bacteria and lysis frequently occur. Rapidly dividing bacteria are those most susceptible to the actin of cephalosporins. /Cephalosporins/",

Histological findings of colistin-induced renal damage usually involve focal irregular dilatation of tubules, epithelial and polymorphonuclear cell cast formation, and degeneration and regeneration of epithelial cells. In addition, separation of tubules by loose collagenous tissue, suggestive of edema, has also been reported. The basement membrane is usually intact, as well as the glomeruli./Polymyxins/",

Four animals were used in each group including control groups. In the single-dose study, THR-221 (600 and 1800 mg/kg) and CET (1800 mg/kg) caused no nephrotoxic effects. In the CEZ groups (600 and 1800 mg/kg), findings indicative of the decreased renal function were obtained: serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels increased over the control values, and phenolsulfonphthalein (PSP) retention test showed a delay in PSP excretion from the blood. In addition, the white surface of the kidney was macroscopically observed, and microscopic examination revealed renal proximal tubular changes such as necrosis, hyaline cast and calcification, suggesting renal disorders. The repeated-dose study also showed similar results to those described above. Administration of THR-221 (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) and CET (600 mg/kg/day) caused no effects on the kidney. In the CEZ groups (200 and 600 mg/kg/day), serum chemical and PSP test results suggested the decreased renal function, and macroscopic and microscopic findings included organic changes in the kidney. These results suggest that under the conditions tested THR-221 dose not elicit signs of nephrotoxicity in contrast to CEZ, and behaves almost equally to CET. /Cephalothin sodium/",

The nephrotoxicity of cefotiam was determined on the basis of the number of tubular epithelial cells excreted, the malate dehydrogenase activity in the urine and the histological examination of the kidneys. Cephalothin (3,000 mg/kg/day) was used as a reference compound. There were slight increases in the number of tubular epithelial cells excreted and in the malate dehydrogenase activity in the urine of some animals receiving 3,000 mg/kg/day of cefotiam or cephalothin. All of these changes disappeared within a few days after the dosing period. The histological examination of the kidneys at the end of both the dosing (5 days) and the recovery (7 days) periods revealed no pathological changes indicating nephrotoxicity. It was concluded that the nephrotoxicity of cefotiam was comparable to that of cephalothin; the urinary changes in animals receiving the highest dose were considered to be an early sign of nephrotoxicity. The maximum non-toxic dose of cefotiam was 1,000 mg/kg/day under the present experimental conditions.",

With the exception of cephalothin, which was markedly toxic to kidney cells in vitro, a good correlation between in vitro toxicity and in vivo nephrotoxicity was obtained, yielding the following toxicity rank order: ceftazidime less than cefazolin approximately cefoperazone less than cephaloglycin approximately cephaloridine. The addition of a kidney microsomal S9 fraction to the cell cultures desacetylated cephalothin as occurs in vivo and detoxified this antibiotic, providing it with the proper toxicity relative to the other cephalosporins. When compared with parent structures, desacetylated derivatives of other cephalosporins such as cephapirin were similarly found to be less toxic to LLC-RK1 cells. The acetylated cephalosporin cephaloglycin was not detoxified by the kidney S9 fraction and was desacetylated three to four times slower than cephalothin by renal esterases. Thus, the rate and extent of desacetylation of cephalosporins may play a role in their in vivo nephrotoxic potential. The results further suggest that LLC-RK1 cells will provide a useful model for evaluating the potential nephrotoxicity of new cephalosporin antibiotics before in vivo studies.",

To further validate a model and to study biochemical mechanisms of cephalosporin-induced injury, cytotoxicity of three cephalosporins was studied in freshly isolated proximal tubular (PT) and distal tubular (DT) cells from rat kidney. The three cephalosporins (cephaloridine (CPH), cephalexin (CXN), cephalothin (CTN)) were chosen because they exhibit varying degrees of nephrotoxicity in vivo and contain different functional groups. CPH produced greater amounts of lactate dehydrogenase release from PT cells than either CXN or CTN, indicating greater toxicity of CPH, which agrees with in vivo observations. DT cells were not affected by any of the cephalosporins. Thus, the cephem ring is sufficient to produce PT cell injury but the presence of other functional groups modifies toxicity. SKF-525A and alpha-tocopherol protected PT cells from both CPH and CTN, suggesting involvement of cytochrome P-450 metabolism and oxidative stress. Both PT and DT cells exhibited transport of CPH or CXN and transport of CPH into PT cells was inhibitable by probenecid, consistent with action of a specific carrier. Transport alone, therefore, cannot account for the cell type specificity pattern in vitro. Effects on intracellular glutathione status, malondaldehyde formation, and uncoupler-stimulated respiration were also investigated, and these generally correlated with cell type specificity patterns but not always with degree of cytotoxicity. These results validate further the isolated PT and DT cells as in vitro models to study cell type-specific renal injury and show a role for oxidative stress, cytochrome P-450 bioactivation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in cephalosporin-induced PT cell injury.",

Particulate-phase cephalothin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Cephalothin may absorb at wavelengths >290 nm (UV max = 260 nm with a possible shoulder above 290 nm) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, cephalothin is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 14. An estimated pKa value of 3.8 (carboxylic acid) indicates that this compound will exist primarily as an anion in the environment and anions generally have higher mobility in soil than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because anions do not volatilize. Cephalothin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available for cephalothin. If released into water, cephalothin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because anions do not volatilize. An estimated BCF of 0.3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Estimated half-lives for the hydrolysis of cephalothin are 230 and 23 days at pH 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to cephalothin may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cephalothin is produced or used. Exposure to cephalothin among the general population may be limited to those administered this substance as a drug and to those who administer cephalothin to animals. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

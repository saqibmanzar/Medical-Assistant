Uremic toxins can be subdivided into three major groups based upon their chemical and physical characteristics: 1) small, water-soluble, non-protein-bound compounds, such as urea; 2) small, lipid-soluble and/or protein-bound compounds, such as the phenols and 3) larger so-called middle-molecules, such as beta2-microglobulin. Chronic exposure of uremic toxins can lead to a number of conditions including renal damage, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. \nPhenyl acetate (or phenylacetate) is a carboxylic acid ester that has been found in the biofluids of patients with nephritis and/or hepatitis as well as patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Excess phenylalanine in the body can be disposed of through a transamination process leading to the production of phenylpyruvate. The phenylpyruvate can be further metabolized into a number of products. Decarboxylation of phenylpyruvate gives phenylacetate, while a reduction reaction gives phenyllactate. The phenylacetate can be further conjugated with glutamine to give phenylacetyl glutamine. All of these metabolites can be detected in serum and urine of PKU patients. Phenyl acetate is also produced endogenously as the metabolite of 2-Phenylethylamine, which is mainly metabolized by monoamine oxidase to form phenyl acetate. 2-phenylethylamine is an endogenous amphetamine which may modulate central adrenergic functions, and the urinary phenyl acetate levels have been postulated as a marker for depression. Phenylacetate is also found in essential oils, e.g. neroli, rose oil, free and as esters' and in many fruits. As a result it is used as a perfumery and flavoring ingredient. (1, 2, 3).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Although exhaled volatile organic compound (VOC) patterns change in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, individual VOC profiles are not fully determined. The primary outcome was VOC characterizations; secondary outcomes included their relationships with sleep and clinical parameters in OSA patients. We prospectively examined 32 OSA patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >/= 15 by full polysomnography, and 33 age- and sex-matched controls without obvious OSA symptoms. Nine severe OSA patients were examined before and after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. By applying a method which eliminates environmental VOC influences, exhaled VOCs were identified by gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry, and their concentrations were determined by GC. Exhaled aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations (toluene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene, and phenylacetic acid) in the severe OSA groups (AHI >/= 30) and exhaled saturated hydrocarbon concentrations (hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, and decane) in the most severe OSA group (AHI >/= 60) were higher than those in the control group. Exhaled isoprene concentrations were increased in all OSA groups (AHI >/= 15); acetone concentration was increased in the most severe OSA group. Ethylbenzene, p-xylene, phenylacetic acid, and nonane concentrations were increased according to OSA severity, and correlated with AHI, arousal index, and duration of percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) </= 90%. Multiple regression analyses revealed these 4 VOC levels were associated with the duration of SpO2 </= 90%. Isoprene and acetone decreased after CPAP treatment. OSA increased some toxic VOCs, and some correlated with OSA severity. CPAP treatment possibly ameliorates these productions.",

We investigated the influence of protein intake on selected tryptophan and phenolic compounds, derived from both endogenous and colonic microbial metabolism. Furthermore, potential inter-species metabolic differences were studied. For this purpose, 29 healthy subjects were allocated to a high (n = 14) or low protein diet (n = 15) for 2 weeks. In addition, 20 wild-type FVB mice were randomized to a high protein or control diet for 21 days. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for measurement of tryptophan and phenolic metabolites. In human subjects, we observed significant changes in plasma level and urinary excretion of indoxyl sulfate (P 0.004 and P 0.001), and in urinary excretion of indoxyl glucuronide (P 0.01), kynurenic acid (P 0.006) and quinolinic acid (P 0.02). In mice, significant differences were noted in plasma tryptophan (P 0.03), indole-3-acetic acid (P 0.02), p-cresyl glucuronide (P 0.03), phenyl sulfate (P 0.004) and phenylacetic acid (P 0.01). Thus, dietary protein intake affects plasma levels and generation of various mammalian metabolites, suggesting an influence on both endogenous and colonic microbial metabolism. Metabolite changes are dissimilar between human subjects and mice, pointing to inter-species metabolic differences with respect to protein intake.",

Here, we isolated a non-antibacterial metabolite from the culture fluid of B. heleia PAK1-2 that was able to suppress B. plantarii virulence and subsequently identified as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). IAA suppressed the production of tropolone in B. plantarii in a dose-dependent manner without any antibacterial and quorum quenching activity, suggesting that IAA inhibited steps of tropolone biosynthesis. Consistent with this, supplementing cultures of B. plantarii with either L-[ring-(2)H5]phenylalanine or [ring-(2)H2~5]phenylacetic acid revealed that phenylacetic acid (PAA), which is the dominant metabolite during the early growth stage, is a direct precursor of tropolone. Exposure of B. plantarii to IAA suppressed production of both PAA and tropolone. These data particularly showed that IAA produced by B. heleia PAK1-2 disrupts tropolone production during bioconversion of PAA to tropolone via the ring-rearrangement on the phenyl group of the precursor to attenuate the virulence of B. plantarii. B. heleia PAK1-2 is thus likely a microbial community coordinating bacterium in rhizosphere ecosystems, which never eliminates phytopathogens but only represses production of phytotoxins or bacteriocidal substances.",

This bioactive amine is also present in certain foodstuffs such as chocolate, cheese and wine and may cause undesirable side effects in susceptible individuals. Metabolism of 2-phenylethylamine to phenylacetaldehyde is catalyzed by monoamine oxidase B but the oxidation to its acid is usually ascribed to aldehyde dehydrogenase and the contribution of aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, if any, is ignored. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of the molybdenum hydroxylases, aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, in the metabolism of phenylacetaldehyde derived from its parent biogenic amine. Treatments of 2-phenylethylamine with monoamine oxidase were carried out for the production of phenylacetaldehyde, as well as treatments of synthetic or enzymatic-generated phenylacetaldehyde with aldehyde oxidase, xanthine oxidase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. The results indicated that phenylacetaldehyde is metabolized mainly to phenylacetic acid with lower concentrations of 2-phenylethanol by all three oxidizing enzymes. Aldehyde dehydrogenase was the predominant enzyme involved in phenylacetaldehyde oxidation and thus it has a major role in 2-phenylethylamine metabolism with aldehyde oxidase playing a less prominent role. Xanthine oxidase does not contribute to the oxidation of phenylacetaldehyde due to low amounts being present in guinea pig. Thus aldehyde dehydrogenase is not the only enzyme oxidizing xenobiotic and endobiotic aldehydes and the role of aldehyde oxidase in such reactions should not be ignored.",

Phenylbutyric acid (PBA) is a well-known chemical chaperone that regulates ER stress. The main objective of this study was to develop a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of phenylbutyric acid and its metabolite, phenylacetic acid (PAA). A LC-MS/MS analysis using negative electrospray ionization was used. Samples were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in 15 min of total run time, using d11-PBA and d7-PAA as internal standards. The limit of quantification was 1 ug/g for tissue and 0.8 ug/mL for plasma. Recoveries for plasma and tissues were higher than 81% for both PBA and PAA. The inter-day and intra-day accuracy and precision were within +/-15%. We then further successfully validated this method by applying it to determine the tissue distribution of PBA and its metabolite PAA after i.p. injection of PBA at a dose of 500 mg/kg in mice. The maximum concentrations of PBA and PAA in plasma and tissues were seen at 15 min and 45 min, respectively. The PBA plasma concentration was 15-fold higher than the concentration in the kidney, whereas the PAA plasma concentration was 6-fold higher than the concentration in the liver. The area under the curve decreased in the order of plasma > kidney > liver > heart > muscle > lung for PBA and plasma > liver > kidney > heart > muscle > lung for PAA. The tissue to plasma ratio ranged from 0.007 to 0.063 for PBA and 0.016 to 0.109 for PAA. In summary, the LC-ESI-MS method developed in this study is simple, sensitive and reliable.",

The evaluation of phenyl acetic acid concentration in the biological fluid reflects phenyl ethylamine levels thus allowing the assessment of the modulatory role of this endogenous substance. Changes in biological fluids levels of 2-phenylethylamine and/or in its metabolite have been reported in affective disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. Recently, the occurrence of the \"attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome\" has been frequently reported in childhood population and involvement of dopaminergic dysfunction in this disease has been suspected. A fast, reliable and reproducible method for the determination of phenyl acetic acid in human blood, is therefore needed in order to have a screening tool for monitoring both healthy childhood population and suspected \"attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome\" patients. The gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method here described makes use of a deuterated internal standard in order to overcome problems related to the lack of reproducibility often encountered when a derivatization step is performed.",

Reduced NO production due to inhibition of either eNOS or iNOS may therefore reinforce atherosclerosis. Patients with end-stage renal failure show markedly increased mortality due to atherosclerosis. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that uremic toxins are responsible for reduced iNOS expression. LPS-induced iNOS expression in mononuclear leukocytes was studied using real-time PCR. The iNOS expression was blocked by addition of plasma from patients with end-stage renal failure, whereas plasma from healthy controls had no effect. Hemofiltrate obtained from patients with end-stage renal failure was fractionated by chromatographic methods. The chromatographic procedures revealed a homogenous fraction that inhibits iNOS expression. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, this inhibitor was identified as phenylacetic acid. Authentic phenylacetic acid inhibited iNOS expression in a dose-dependent manner. In healthy control subjects, plasma concentrations were below the detection level, whereas patients with end-stage renal failure had a phenylacetic acid concentration of 3.49 +/- 0.33 mmol/L (n = 41). It is concluded that accumulation of phenylacetic acid in patients with end-stage renal failure inhibits iNOS expression. That mechanism may contribute to increased atherosclerosis and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with end-stage renal failure.",

We observed that all three conjugated acids are higher in fasting than in non-fasting subjects, and unconjugated phenylacetic acid was lower. Ingestion of deuterium-labelled amine precursors resulted in the appearance in the blood of the correspondingly labelled acids, a peak in the concentrations being reached about 1 hr after consumption. Conjugated and unconjugated acids as expected increased following the consumption of a meal. Unconjugated phenylacetic acid was significantly higher in females than in males. Most values tended to increase with age, with male unconjugated and conjugated m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and female conjugated phenylacetic and m-hydroxyphenylacetic acids increasing significantly.",

It is used in perfume, as a precursor in manufacture of penicillin G, fungicide, flavoring, and laboratory reagent. It is also used in production of drugs of abuse. HUMAN STUDIES: Inhalation exposure leads to cough, sore throat. Skin exposure leads to redness. Eyes exposure leads to redness, pain. ANIMAL STUDIES: Acute oral toxicity in rats is low. In study of acute effects in mice, ip injection of 300 mg/kg was toxic. Phenylacetic acid did not promote tumor formation when given to rabbits iv and sc for 40 days. In vitro phenylacetic acid induced dose-related embryotoxicity above 0.3 mg/mL. In teratogenic study with rats, administration of 3.2 mg/kg phenylacetic acid on 12th day of embryogenesis affected body weight, retarded skeletal ossification, and caused embryos to be resorbed at twice rate of controls. Phenylacetic acid inhibits activity of coenzyme A.",

Increased levels of uremic toxins can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species. This seems to be mediated by the direct binding or inhibition by uremic toxins of the enzyme NADPH oxidase (especially NOX4 which is abundant in the kidneys and heart) (A7868). Reactive oxygen species can induce several different DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which are involved in the silencing of a protein known as KLOTHO.  KLOTHO has been identified as having important roles in anti-aging, mineral metabolism, and vitamin D metabolism. A number of studies have indicated that KLOTHO mRNA and protein levels are reduced during acute or chronic kidney diseases in response to high local levels of reactive oxygen species (A7869)",

Since phenylacetic acid (PAA), identified as one of the uremic toxins, has an inhibiting property of monocytes as well as osteoblastic cells, we examined the effects of PAA on TNF-alpha secretion and oxidative stress in vascular endothelial cells. In human aortic endothelial cells, TNF-alpha secretion was assessed after treatment with PAA using an ELISA kit and following the manufacturer's instructions. For determination of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the culture medium was measured in the presence or absence of PAA. Treatment with PAA in aortic endothelial cells for 24 hr significantly stimulated TNF-alpha secretion in a dose-dependent manner ranging between 0.5 and 5 mM. On the other hand, the 8-OHdG level in the culture medium was significantly increased in the cells incubated with 1 mM PAA for 12 hr. To determine if PAA-induced TNF-alpha secretion is mediated by ROS production, the effect of free radical scavenger 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPOL) was examined. It was found that PAA-induced TNF-alpha secretion was significantly inhibited by TEMPOL. Our findings indicate that PAA stimulates TNF-alpha secretion at least in part through ROS production in aortic endothelial cells. The plasma PAA level was reported to be approximately 3.5 mM in end-stage CKD patients, whereas it was <5 uM in healthy subjects; thus, PAA could be involved in the pathological changes of the vasculature in CKD.",

In this study, inhibitors of Ca2+ ATPase were isolated from ultrafiltrate of patients with end-stage renal failure. They were identified as dimethylguanosine, phenylethylamine, and phenylacetic acid by chromatography and mass spectrometry. Ca2+ ATPase activity was measured spectrophotometrically as the difference in hydrolysis of ATP in the presence and absence of Ca2+ with different concentrations of ATP and the isolated substances. All of the identified compounds are sufficiently lipophilic to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and to accumulate in cerebral tissue. The inhibitory effects of these agents were additive. The apparent K(m) values for ATP and Ca2+ were not altered by these substances, suggesting a noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition. In plasma of healthy subjects, the substances were not detectable.",

Both are approved for treatment of urea cycle disorders (UCDs) - rare genetic disorders characterized by hyperammonemia. PAA is conjugated with glutamine in the liver to form phenylacetyleglutamine (PAGN), which is excreted in urine. PAA plasma levels >/= 500 ug/dL have been reported to be associated with reversible neurological adverse events (AEs) in cancer patients receiving PAA intravenously. Therefore, we have investigated the relationship between PAA levels and neurological AEs in patients treated with these PAA pro-drugs as well as approaches to identifying patients most likely to experience high PAA levels. The relationship between nervous system AEs, PAA levels and the ratio of plasma PAA to PAGN were examined in 4683 blood samples taken serially from: [1] healthy adults [2], UCD patients of >/= 2 months of age, and [3] patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). The plasma ratio of PAA to PAGN was analyzed with respect to its utility in identifying patients at risk of high PAA values. Only 0.2% (11) of 4683 samples exceeded 500 ug/mL. There was no relationship between neurological AEs and PAA levels in UCD or HE patients, but transient AEs including headache and nausea that correlated with PAA levels were observed in healthy adults. Irrespective of population, a curvilinear relationship was observed between PAA levels and the plasma PAA:PAGN ratio, and a ratio>2.5 (both in ug/mL) in a random blood draw identified patients at risk for PAA levels>500 ug/mL. The presence of a relationship between PAA levels and reversible AEs in healthy adults but not in UCD or HE patients may reflect intrinsic differences among the populations and/or metabolic adaptation with continued dosing. The plasma PAA:PAGN ratio is a functional measure of the rate of PAA metabolism and represents a useful dosing biomarker.",

In this work, the efficiency of phenylacetic acid (PAA) in reducing the production of AHL-dependent factors in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was studied. PAA at a concentration of 200 ug/mL displayed significant reduction in QS-dependent pyocyanin, exopolysaccharide, and protease and elastase production in PAO1. In swimming inhibition assay, PAA-treated PAO1 cells exhibited poor motility in swimming agar plate. In in vivo analysis, PAO1-preinfected Caenorhabditis elegans showed enhanced survival when treated with PAA. PAA at the QS inhibitory concentration showed no growth inhibitory activity on PAO1. Results of the present study revealed the potential of PAA as antipathogenic compound to prevent QS-dependent pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa.",

Phenylacetic acid is on the US DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) list of surveillance chemicals used in clandestine drug manufacture. Phenylacetic acid occurs in tobacco smoke and emissions from wood combustion. It occurs in various essential oils, tobacco, orange flowers, cocoa, guava, papaya, raspberry, strawberry, tomato, pepper, passion fruit, starfruit, mango, and mushroom. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.8X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates phenylacetic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase phenylacetic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.6 days. Phenylacetic acid does not absorb UV light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, phenylacetic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon Koc values of 26, 28 and 31. The pKa of phenylacetic acid is 4.31, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Utilizing an unadapted soil suspension, biodegradation of 90% in 3 days was reported, indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, phenylacetic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Under anaerobic conditions, phenylacetic acid biodegraded >90% in 60 days using municipal sewage waste water. The pKa indicates that phenylacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to phenylacetic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where phenylacetic acid is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to phenylacetic acid via inhalation of tobacco and wood smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing phenylacetic acid.

Phenylacetic acid does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Phenylacetic acid has been qualitatively identified in ground water contaminated by a landfill in Florida in 1991(2). At a groundwater site contaminated by wood preserving chemicals in Pensacola FL, phenylacetic acid was detected at the following concentrations and depths: 3.94 mg/L at 6.1 m, 1.3 mg/L at 3.3 m, 1.45 mg/L at 5.8 m, and 0.00 mg/L at 11.0 m(3). In a multiple basalt aquifer polluted by organic wastes dumped into unused quarry holes (Werribee Plains, Australia), phenylacetic acid was qualitatively identified(4). Phenylacetic acid was found in ground water samples at 3.3-3.5 mg/L of total organic carbon from superfund sites(5). Ground water samples taken in 1990 from 7 wells down gradient from an oil spill in Bemidji, MN in 1979 had concentrations ranges from <0.015-0.123 uM(6).",

Phenylacetic acid has been reported at Superfund Sites 181 times(2). Phenylacetic acid has been qualitatively detected in the effluent from a publicly-owned treatment works facility in Addison, IL in 1980(3). Water soluble fractions of soil samples taken from a controlled landfill site contained phenylacetic acid: 20.6%, 18.7%, and 41.1% at 1-1.5 m, 3-3.5 m, and 6.5-7 m deep, respectively(4). Phenylacetic acid has been identified in three leachate samples each from two low-level radioactive waste disposal sites: Maxey Flats, KY Trench Leachate; at 0.56, 1.5 and 3.4 mg/L and West Valley, NY Trench Leachate; 3.8, 7.5 and 6.0 mg/L(5). Phenylacetic acid was detected in primary waste treatment effluent and in the acid fraction of domestic US sewage treatment effluents(6). Phenylacetic acid was listed as a contaminant found in advanced waste treatment water for a survey of US cities including Lake Tahoe, CA, Orange County, CA, Dallas, TX, and Blue Plains, Washington, DC(7). The estimated emission rate of phenylacetic acid to the South coast air basin of California in the late 1980s was 250 kg/day(8).",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

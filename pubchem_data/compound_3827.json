The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Ketotifen is a potent and non-competitive antagonist of H1 histamine receptors, which is likely to be a significant contributor to its anti-allergic activity. In addition, ketotifen stabilizes mast cells and has demonstrated _in vitro_ the ability to inhibit the release of allergic and inflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes C<sub>4</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> (i.e. SRS-A), and platelet-activating factor (PAF).  Other _in vivo_ observations thought to contribute to ketotifen's efficacy in asthma include the inhibition of various PAF-mediated processes (e.g. airway hyperreactivity, eosinophil and platelet accumulation in the airways), prevention of leukotriene-induced bronchoconstriction, and suppression of eosinophil priming.",

Ketotifen possesses a powerful and sustained non-competitive histamine (H1) blocking property. Ketotifen's antihistamine (H1) effect seems to be distinct from it antiallergic properties. Properties of ketotifen which may contribute to its antiallergic activity and its ability to affect the underlying pathology of asthma include: In Vivo results: Inhibition of the development of airway hyperreactivity associated with activation of platelets by PAF (Platelet Activating Factor) or caused by neural activation following the use of sympathomimetic drugs or the exposure to allergen; inhibition of PAF-induced accumulation of eosinophils and platelets in the airways; suppression of the priming of eosinophils by human recombinant cytokines and thereby suppression of the influx of eosinophils into inflammatory loci; antagonism of bronchoconstriction due to leukotrienes. In Vitro results: inhibition of the release of allergic mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes C4 and D4 (SRS-A) and PAF. /Ketotifen fumarate (systemic)/",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,3-dibromo-1- propanol in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the skin, forestomach, liver, and lung. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,3-dibromo-1-propanol in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the skin and the forestomach.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of 2,3-dibromo-1-propanol were conducted by applying the chemical in 95% ethanol to the interscapular skin of male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice 5 days a week for 13 weeks in the prechronic study and 48-55 weeks (rats) or 36-42 weeks (mice) in the carcinogenicity study. In the 13-week study, 10 rats and 10 mice of each sex received doses of 0, 44, 88, 177, 375, or 750 mg/kg. Deaths associated with chemical application occurred only in the high-dose (750 mg/kg) male mice. Chemical-related lesions were seen in the kidney of male rats, liver of female rats, and liver and lung of both sexes of mice. Based on the toxicity observed in the 13-week study, 50 rats of each sex received doses of 0, 188, or 375 mg/kg and 50 mice of each sex received 0, 88, or 177 mg/kg in the carcinogenicity study. The planned 2-year study was terminated early because of reduced survival of rats related to chemical-induced neoplasia and because of the appearance of antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in sentinel mice. Nearly all dosed rats had malignant neoplasms at one or more sites, while only one control male and one control female had malignant neoplasms. In rats, neoplasms induced by 2,3-dibromo-1-propanol occurred in the skin, nasal mucosa, Zymbal's gland, oral mucosa, esophagus, forestomach, intestines, liver, kidney, mammary gland (females), clitoral gland (females), spleen (males), and mesothelium (males). In mice, chemical-induced neoplasms occurred in the skin, forestomach, liver (males), and lung (males).",

Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by applying 2,3-dibromo-1-propanol (approximately 98% pure) in ethanol to the subscapular area of the skin of male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice 5 days/wk for ... 48 to 51 weeks (male rats), 52 to 55 weeks (female rats), 36 to 39 weeks (male mice), or 39 to 42 weeks (female mice). ... LONG-TERM STUDY IN RATS: Originally planned to last for 2 years, the chronic study in rats was terminated early because of reduced survival in the high-dose groups related to chemical induced neoplasms and because of the detection of antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in sentinel mice. Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats received dermal applications of 0, 188 or 375 mg/kg 2,3-dibromo-1-propanol 5 days/wk for 48 to 51 wk (males) or 52 to 55 (females). LONG-TERM STUDY IN MICE: Originally planned to last for 2 yr, the chronic study in mice was terminated early because of the detection of antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in sentinel mice. Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice received dermal applications of 0, 88, or 177 mg/kg 2,3-dibromo-1-propanol 5 days/wk for 36 to 39 wk (males) or 39 to 42 wk (females). CONCLUSIONS Under the conditions of these long term dermal studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,3-dibromo-1 -propanol in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the skin, nose, oral mucosa, esophagus, forestomach, small and large intestine, Zymbal's gland, liver, kidney, tunica vaginalis, and spleen. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,3-dibromo-1-propanol in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the skin, nose, oral mucosa, esophagus, forestomach, small and large intestine, Zymbal's gland, liver, kidney, clitoral gland, and mammary gland. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,3-dibromo-1- propanol in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the skin, forestomach, liver, and lung. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,3-dibromo-1-propanol in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the skin and the forestomach. The increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas in female mice may have been related to chemical administration.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.09 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,3-dibromopropanol will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,3-dibromopropanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 days. If released to soil, 2,3-dibromopropanol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.3X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Limited data indicate that 2,3-dibronopropanol may biodegrade under aerobic conditions. If released into water, 2,3-dibromopropanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 2,3-Dibromopropanol may slowly hydrolyze in basic waters although the rate of this process is expected to be slower than for biodegradation. Occupational exposure to 2,3-dibromopropanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,3-dibromopropanol is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

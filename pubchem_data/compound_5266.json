PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

These patients who had amniocentesis at the 19th-21st week of pregnancy were examined for the detection of Toxoplasma DNA. Detailed ultrasonographic examinations performed between the 20th and 24th gestational weeks and the mothers and babies were followed for at least one year. ut of 61 patients, 55 (90.2%) had received Spy prophylaxis while 6 (9.8%) cases refused Spy prophylaxis. Toxoplasma PCR test was found to be positive in amniotic fluid of 4 (6.6%) patients obtained by amniocentesis at the 19th-21st week of pregnancy. All four of these patients had refused Spy prophylaxis had positive Toxoplasma PCR in amniotic fluid (p < 0.01). Our results seem to encourage the use of spiramycin in women with toxoplasmosis during pregnancy.",

In this study we assessed the effects of this drug on ventricular repolarization & on the potential risk of lethal arrhythmias in 8 newborn infants in whom toxoplasmosis prophylaxis after birth was necessary. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) & echocardiograms were recorded during spiramycin therapy (350,000 i.u./kg/ day) & after its withdrawal. In a control group of 8 healthy newborns matched for age & sex, no differences were found between 2 ECGs analogously recorded. The QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) was longer during spiramycin therapy than after drug withdrawal (448 +/- 32 msec vs 412 +/- 10 msec, +9%, p=0.021). QTc dispersion, expressed as the difference between the longest & the shortest value in 12 different leads (QTcmax-min), was also higher during spiramycin therapy (60 +/- 32 msec vs 34 +/- 8 msec, +76%, p=0.021), mainly because of a major lengthening of the longest QTc (QTcmax). QTc & QTc dispersion were markedly increased in the 2 newborns who experienced cardiac arrest after beginning treatment compared with the 6 neonates who had no drug-induced symptoms. During therapy 7 of 8 newborns had a rare abnormality in the thickening of the left ventricular posterior wall similar to that observed in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. This abnormality disappeared after drug withdrawal. Thus antibiotic therapy with spiramycin in the neonatal period may induce QT interval prolongation & incr QT dispersion. When this effect on ventricular repolarization is more marked, it may favor the occurrence of torsades des pointes & lead to cardiac arrest.",

Based on the estimated concentration with no effect on the human gut flora, a temporary ADI of 0-5 \u00b5g/kg bw was established at the 38th meeting, with the requirement of additional in vivo studies on the effect of spiramycin on the human intestinal flora. In view of the additional reassurance provided by the new data, and as these studies covered a wide range of organisms, the Committee reconsidered the magnitude of the safety factor and concluded that a safety factor of 1 instead of 10, was appropriate. The other parameters used in the previous evaluation provide a conservative estimate. As a result the Committee established an ADI of 0-50 \u00b5g/kg bw, using the formula: ADI (\u00b5g/kg bw) = (1 \u00b5g/ml (concentration without effect on gut flora) x 150 g (fecal bolus))/(0.05 (bioavailable fraction) x 1 (safety factor) x 60 kg (adult weight)) = 50 \u00b5g/kg bw.",

This work investigated the disposition of spiramycin in plasma & milk after iv, intramuscular & subcutaneous admin. Twelve healthy cows were given a single injection of spiramycin at a dose of 30,000 IU/kg by each route. Plasma & milk were collected post injection. Spiramycin concn in the plasma was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography method, & in the milk by a microbiological method. The mean residence time after iv admin was significantly longer (P<0.01) in the milk (20.7 +/- 2.7 h) than in plasma (4.0 +/- 1.6 h). An average milk-to-plasma ratio of 36.5 +/- 15 was calculated from the area concn-time curves. Several pharmacokinetic parameters were examined to determine the bioequivalence of the two extravascular routes. The dose fraction adsorbed after intramuscular or subcutaneous admin was almost 100% & was bioequivalent for the extravascular routes, but the rates of absorption, the max concns & the time to obtain them differed significantly between the two routes. Spiramycin quantities excreted in milk did not differ between the two extravascular routes but the latter were not bioequivalent for max concn in the milk. However, the two routes were bio-equivalent for the duration of time the milk concn exceeded the minimal inhibitory concn (MIC) of various pathogens causing infections in the mammary gland.",

It is available as a spiramycin embonate for use in animal feed, and as the adipate, a more soluble form, for administration by other routes. It has also been used in the protozoal infections cryptosporidiosis and toxoplasmosis. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Spiramycin is reported to cause contact dermatitis in occupational settings. A man who worked in a feed factory developed allergic contact dermatitis due to airborne spiramycin. The patient suffered recurrent outbreaks of eczematous lesions on uncovered areas during working periods. Spiramycin is also reported to cause hypersensitivity reactions.  Rhinoconjunctivitis and spasmodic cough are reported in a 34 year-old female handling spiramycin powder in a pharmaceutical factory. The symptoms appeared within the first few hours of coming into contact with the drug and continued for several hours after leaving her place of work. One year after starting work in the pharmaceutical industry a 35-year-old non-atopic maintenance engineer developed attacks of sneezing, coughing and breathlessness. Inhalation challenge tests carried out in the hospital with gradually increasing quantities of spiramycin reproduced his symptoms and led to the development of late asthmatic reactions. Additionally, two cases of bronchial asthma due to spiramycin in workers of a pharmaceutical factory were reported. The subjects complained of cough, breathlessness and symptoms of asthma at work when coming into contact with spiramycin's powder. The symptoms cleared when away from work for more than 3 or 4 days. ANIMAL STUDIES: Groups of 2 male and 2 female monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were given daily intravenous injections of 0, 240,000, 360,000, and 540,000 iu/kg bw/day spiramycin adipate for 5 days. Hypersalivation occurred during injection in all dose groups. Muscle hypotonia and nauseous spasticity occurred in several high dose monkeys and in one given the low dose. No abnormalities of body weights occurred but food consumption was reduced in all treated animals. A slight decrease in hemoglobin, red cell numbers and hematocrit was noted in high dose animals. In a short-term dietary study in which rats were given the equivalent of up to 3900 mg/kg bw for 13 weeks, the only major effects noted were a reduction in neutrophil counts in some mid- and high-dose animals, and the dilatation of the caecum. In another dietary study in the rat, animals were given up to the equivalent of 720 mg/kg bw/day for one year. The only notable effects were reductions in the body weights of females receiving the high doses, and increases in relative liver, kidney, and adrenal weights at high dose levels in animals of both sexes. Hepatic glycogen depletion occurred at all dose levels but not in controls. In mongrel dogs given 500 mg/kg bw/day for up to 56 days, reductions in spermatogenesis and testicular atrophy occurred. Kidney damage was also seen. When beagles were given orally spiramycin at up to the equivalent of 150 mg/kg bw/day for two years, testicular damage was not seen although degenerative changes occurred in other organs. In teratogenicity studies in mice, oral doses of spiramycin of up to 400 mg/kg bw given over days 5-15 of gestation had no effects on the outcome of pregnancy. intravenous doses of up to 84 mg/kg bw/day given on days 6-15 of gestation to rats and day 6-19 to rabbits had no effect on developmental, but oral dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg bw/day in rabbit produced caecal enlargement in mothers. Groups of 20 pregnant rats were treated intravenously on days 6-15 of gestation with doses of 0, 90 000, 180 000, and 270 000 iu/kg bw/day with spiramycin adipate. The highest dose given produced brief (5 minutes) ataxia and tremors immediately after dosing. A slight but significant reduction in fetal weight occurred at the intermediate dose but all values were within historical control ranges. There were no increased incidences of any fetal anomaly noted in this study. In a study where male rats were given doses of 30 mg/kg bw/day for 8 days by an unspecified route, mitotic and meiotic abnormalities in spermatogonia were noted. Negative result were obtained with spiramycin adipate and embonate in a forward-mutation test in mammalian cells in vitro, in an in vitro cytogenic assay, and in the mouse micronucleus test.",

These drugs are indicated in a variety of infections & are often combined with other drug therapies, thus creating the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. Macrolides can both inhibit drug metab in the liver by complex formation & inactivation of microsomal drug oxidising enzymes & also interfere with microorganisms of the enteric flora through their antibiotic effects. Over the past 20 yrs, a number of reports have incriminated macrolides as a potential source of clinically severe drug interactions. However, differences have been found between the various macrolides in this regard & not all macrolides are responsible for drug interactions. With the recent advent of many semisynthetic macrolide antibiotics it is now evident that they may be classified into 3 different groups in causing drug interactions. The first group (e.g. troleandomycin, erythromycins) are those prone to forming nitrosoalkanes & the consequent formation of inactive cytochrome P450-metabolite complexes. The second group (e.g. josamycin, flurithromycin, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, miocamycin & midecamycin) form complexes to a lesser extent & rarely produce drug interactions. The last group (e.g. spiramycin, rokitamycin, dirithromycin & azithromycin) do not inactivate cytochrome P450 & are unable to modify the pharmacokinetics of other cmpds. It appears that 2 structural factors are important for a macrolide antibiotic to lead to the induction of cytochrome P450 & the formation in vivo or in vitro of an inhibitory cytochrome P450-iron-nitrosoalkane metabolite complex: the presence in the macrolide molecules of a non-hindered readily accessible N-dimethylamino group & the hydrophobic character of the drug. Troleandomycin ranks first as a potent inhibitor of microsomal liver enzymes, causing a significant decr of the metab of methylprednisolone, theophylline, carbamazepine, phenazone (antipyrine) & triazolam. Troleandomycin can cause ergotism in patients receiving ergot alkaloids & cholestatic jaundice in those taking oral contraceptives. Erythromycin & its different prodrugs appear to be less potent inhibitors of drug metab. Case reports & controlled studies have, however, shown that erythromycins may interact with theophylline, carbamazepine, methylprednisolone, warfarin, cyclosporin, triazolam, midazolam, alfentanil, disopyramide & bromocriptine, decreasing drug clearance. The bioavailability of digoxin appears also to be increased by erythromycin in patients excreting high amounts of reduced digoxin metabolites, probably due to destruction of enteric flora responsible for the formation of these cmpds. These incriminated macrolide antibiotics should not be administered concomitantly with other drugs known to be affected metabolically by them, or at the very least, combined admin should be carried out only with careful patient monitoring.",

This sudden complication was attributed to the simultaneous prescription of Spiramycine and Mequitazine over a 48 hour period. These two drugs are not considered to be predisposing factors for torsades de pointes despite the fact that they belong to two families of drugs which can trigger this type of arrhythmia. The withdrawal of this treatment led to the complete regression of the syncopal episodes with a follow-up of two years and a significant shortening of the initial QTc interval which remained, nevertheless, longer than normal. This case underlines the potential risks of drug associations of these two families of drugs, especially in patients with the congenital long QT syndrome.",

Six subjects were given 1 g spiramycin twice a day for 5 days. Fecal and saliva samples were collected for examination before treatment with the drug, during the treatment, and 7 and 21 days after.  There was no evidence of an increased colonization of the oral cavity by enterobacteria, enterococci, staphylococci or fungi as a result of treatment with spiramycin. The mean anaerobe counts of feces were not affected by spiramycin intake; there were no effects on enterobacteria and enterocci counts. Similarly, there were no increases in fungi, staphylococci or  Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was a shift in the numbers of enterobacteria resistant to the effects of high concentrations of spiramycin with counts increasing during treatment. Similarly, increases in Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values for anaerobes and enterococci occurred during treatment. These changes were considered by the authors merely to reflect a selective pressure in the treatment period and they concluded that spiramycin had a limited effect on the intestinal flora of healthy volunteers at 2 g per day (approximately 33 mg/kg/day).",

These occurred at home during the evening and early morning, never at work during the day. His employment involved contact with a wide variety of chemical agents including the macrolide antibiotic spiramycin. Inhalation challenge tests carried out in hospital with gradually increasing quantities of spiramycin reproduced his symptoms and led to the development of late asthmatic reactions, during which the FEV1 fell by 25% and the FEV1/FVC ratio by 15%. No change occurred in the single breath CO transfer factor nor were crepitations heard over the lung fields which remained normal on chest X-ray. The patient showed positive immediate skin prick tests to spiramycin and developed blood eosinophilia during the late asthma attacks. Inhalation of sodium cromoglycate either before, or before and hourly after the provocation challenge for 6 hr, failed to prevent the late asthma, although its onset was further delayed. On leaving the pharmaceutical industry the patient's symptoms improved but did not finally clear until his wife, who had worked in a clerical capacity in the same factory also ceased her employment.",

A 43 yr old man who had worked for 13 yrs in cattle breeding presented with an 18 month history of erythema, edema, & vesicles on the interdigital spaces of the hands, the face, & both sides of the neck. Part of his duties was to prepare a special drink formulation for suckling & weaning calves for which he mixed a powdered commercially prepared animal feed with water & a variety of antibiotics. His symptoms worsened whenever he prepared this animal feed. He was patch tested with the GIRDCA standard series, a preservatives series, & numerous antibiotics. Positive reactions were detected at 2 & 3 days to oxytetracycline-hydrochloride, tylosin, penicillin, & spiramycin. The dermatitis completely cleared as soon as the patient left his occupation. The authors strongly recommend the testing of animal feed workers with the most commonly used feed additives, even if their dermatitis is not thought to be related to their jobs & even if the clinical features are not suggestive of an occupational cause.",

This sudden complication was attributed to the simultaneous prescription of Spiramycine and Mequitazine over a 48 hour period. These two drugs are not considered to be predisposing factors for torsades de pointes despite the fact that they belong to two families of drugs which can trigger this type of arrhythmia. The withdrawal of this treatment led to the complete regression of the syncopal episodes with a follow-up of two years and a significant shortening of the initial QTc interval which remained, nevertheless, longer than normal. This case underlines the potential risks of drug associations of these two families of drugs, especially in patients with the congenital long Qt syndrome.",

At the end of this time, 10 rats/sex/group were killed and the remainder maintained on the treatment diets for a further week and then allowed a 4-week recovery period (i.e., up to week 18). The equivalent doses varied over the test period, being 219, 1204, and 5858 mg/kg b.w./day for 2000, 10,000, and 50,000 ppm males and 214, 1019, and 5233 mg/kg bw/day for 2000, 10,000, and 50,000 ppm females in week 1 of the study while at week 13 the respective values were 89, 473, and 2488 mg/kg bw/day and 116, 581, and 2779 mg/kg bw/day. These were equivalent to mean doses of 140, 718, and 3695 mg/kg bw/day for males and 162, 785, and 3911 mg/kg bw/day for females.  During the study clinical observations were made daily, body weights measured weekly and food consumption weekly. Ophthalmology was conducted at weeks 6 and 13 in high level and control animals. Hematological and biochemical tests and urinalyses were carried out at weeks 6 and 13, and 16 and 18 in recovery groups. At necropsy, all major organs were weighed and the animals were subjected to full histopathological examination.  There was no compound-related mortality during the study and no major clinical signs attributable to spiramycin intake. Significant reductions in body weight gains were noted in high dietary level animals as were significant reductions in food consumption in high level males.  Hematological examination showed reductions in neutrophils in mid- and high-dietary level animals at week 6 in males and females although the effect in the latter group was not statistically significant. At week 16 of the recovery period, reductions in both neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were noted in mid- and high-dietary level males. There were no significant biochemical effects but urinalyses showed reductions in urinary protein at weeks 6 and 13 in high level males, although the effect was not statistically significant at the latter time point.  At termination, there were reductions in mean relative liver weights. Bone marrow examination showed reductions in lymphocytes in high level males. The authors considered the effects on circulating lymphocytes to be unrelated to compound intake as they were not seen during the treatment period. The only other major effect noted on histopathological examination was dilatation of the cecum. Testicular degeneration was not seen. The no-observed effect level was approximately 140 mg/kg bw/day. /Spiramycin embonate/",

It is produced by the soil microbe Streptomyces ambofaciens. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.9X10-31 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates spiramycin will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase spiramycin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Spiramycin contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, spiramycin is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 140. However estimated pKa values of 7.88 and 9.28, indicate that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9X10-35 atm-cu m/mole and the estimated pKa values. Spiramycin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation of spiramycin was 70% in 28 days digested in poultry manure under aerobic conditions and 95% in 32 days digested by sludge under anaerobic conditions suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, spiramycin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant and pKa values. An estimated BCF of 8 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound did not hydrolyze under environmental conditions at pH 4 to 9. Occupational exposure to spiramycin may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where spiramycin is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population is not likely to be exposed to spiramycin unless by direct medical treatment. (SRC)",

Volatilization of spiramycin from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9X10-35 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(2) and the estimated pKa values(3). Spiramycin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 9.9X10-31 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2). Biodegradation of spiramycin was 70% in 28 days digested in poultry manure under aerobic conditions(5) and 95% in 32 days digested by sludge under anaerobic conditions(6) suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces of the neutral form is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.9X10-31 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Estimated pKa values of 7.88 and 9.28(4) indicate spiramycin will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization of the cation from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound did not hydrolyze at 25 \u00b0C in buffer solutions at pH 4 to 9(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 8(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 1.87(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation of spiramycin was 70% in 28 days digested in poultry manure under aerobic conditions(7) and 95% in 32 days, digested by sludge under anaerobic conditions(8) suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The Henry's Law constant for spiramycin is estimated as 9.0X10-35 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) using a fragment constant estimation method(2). This Henry's Law constant indicates that the neutral form of spiramycin is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water and moist soil surfaces(3).

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA. Alkylating agents are cell cycle-nonspecific. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Elevations in activity were accompanied by transient increases in the mRNA levels of both genes (R1 and R2) that code for ribonucleotide reductase. Only the protein for the limiting component for enzyme activity R2 was significantly elevated in chlorambucil treated cultures. The chlorambucil effects upon activity and regulation of ribonucleotide reductase occurred without any detectable changes in the rate of DNA synthesis, as would be expected if the elevation in enzyme activity is required for DNA repair. The chlorambucil-induced elevations in R1 and R2 message levels were blocked by treatment of cells with actinomycin D or the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate indicating the importance of the reductase transcriptional process in responding to the action of chlorambucil and providing evidence for the involvement of a protein kinase C pathway in the regulation of mammalian ribonucleotide reductase. In addition to the chlorambucil-induced elevations in enzyme activity, message, and protein levels, the drug was also shown to be an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase activity in cell-free preparations. Both R1 and R2 proteins were targets for chlorambucil, in keeping with the known alkylating abilities of the drug.",

These are repaired rapidly in an error-free fashion by methylguanine methyltransferase (sometimes called alkylguanine alkyltransferase). However, some cells lack this repair activity, usually because of silencing of the corresponding gene, and the unrepaired DNA mono-adduct then forms a complex with mismatch-repair enzymes. The subsequent inhibition of DNA replication can eventually induce DNA breakage. The second chloroethyl group of the DNA mono-adduct with chlorambucil can interact with proteins but more importantly, because of its juxtaposition to other bases in the major groove of DNA, it can react with a DNA base to form an interstrand DNA cross-link. This DNA crosslink complex is quite stable, and its repair requires nucleotide excision repair factors (such as xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F-excison repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency, complementation group, 1-XPF-ERCC1) that act slowly by homologous recombination. The DNA cross-link attracts several binding proteins, probably the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins, Fanconi anemia gene product, and Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene product to form a complex. As shown in cultured HeLa cells, addition of chlorambucil prolongs S-phase and induces a corresponding mitotic delay. The magnitude of these effects correlates with the level of DNA cross-links. Treatment of cells in the G2-phase of the cell cycle does not induce mitotic delay but does inhibit DNA synthesis in the subsequent cell cycle, and causes a delay in the next mitosis, suggesting that at least some lesions induced by chlorambucil are long-lasting.",

The UV detection system had the best detection limits (5 and 10 ng/ml for melphalan and chlorambucil, respectively) owing to the low baseline noise level. Pharmacokinetic data on melphalan and chlorambucil obtained in clinical studies on humans are reported. Elimination of chlorambucil from plasma was independent of renal function, but potentially toxic levels of melphalan were obtained in patients with poor renal function.",

Exposure to this off-white, slightly granular powder may occur from its manufacture, formulation, or distribution for use as an antineoplastic drug. Effects from exposure may include vomiting, ataxia, seizures, coma, infertility, acute renal failure, acute leukemia, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, irreversable bone marrow damage, and chromosomal damage. Chlorambucil has been indicated as a human carcinogen (Group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Exposure should be controlled by mechanical ventilation with high-efficiency particulate arrestors (HEPA) or charcoal filters to minimize the amount of the substance in exhausted air. In activities or situations where over-exposure may occur, wear protective clothing and carefully fitted respirators. Potentially exposed skin should be immediately and thoroughly washed with soap and water. Contaminated clothing should be removed and discarded or left at the work site for cleaning before reuse. Smoking, eating, and drinking should be prohibited in chlorambucil work areas. Chlorambucil should be stored and transported in securely sealed glass bottles or ampoules, which are in turn placed inside strong screw-cap or snap-top containers. This substance is a good candidate for disposal by rotary kiln or fluidized bed forms of incineration.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

Rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury attributed to chlorambucil have been reported. The onset of symptoms was within 2 to 6 weeks of starting chlorambucil and the typical enzyme pattern was cholestatic. Some cases have had features of hypersensitivity (rash, fever), and liver injury has recurred upon rechallenge. This form of liver injury is rare and resembles the idiosyncratic acute liver injury due to cyclophosphamide. Chlorambucil has not been linked specifically to sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, but it is not used in high doses in neoplastic disease or in conditioning regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation, situations in which alkylating agents are commonly associated with this complication. Chlorambucil therapy has also been linked to hypersensitivity reactions and severe cutaneous adverse events such as Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, both of which can be accompanied by serum enzyme elevations and hepatitis.",

The interval between discontinuation of medication that cause immunosuppression and restoration of the patient's ability to respond to the vaccine depends on the intensity and type of immunosuppression-causing medications used, the underlying disease, and other factors; estimates vary from 3 months to 1 year. Patients with leukemia in remission should not receive live virus vaccine until at least 3 months after their last chemotherapy. In addition, immunization with oral polio-virus vaccine should be postponed in persons in close contact with the patient, especially family members.",

In one child who ingested 5 mg/kg, coma (lasting 24 hours) and major motor seizures developed within 5 hours after ingestion; multiple seizures occurred in the first 24 hours, but the child markedly improved with complete disappearance of signs and symptoms within 24-48 hours. In another child, multifocal myoclonic seizures occurred within 16 hours but cleared spontaneously within 32 hours without anticonvulsant therapy. In another child, lethargy, irritability, and periods of hyperactivity with jerky movements occurred over 48 hours and subsided within 3-5 days.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.3X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chlorambucil will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase chlorambucil will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.7 hours. Particulate-phase chlorambucil will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Chlorambucil exhibits an absorption maximum in water of 256 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, chlorambucil is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 11. The pKa of chlorambucil is 5.75, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Chlorambucil may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, chlorambucil is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. The pKa indicates chlorambucil will exist partially in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process given a measured half-life of 1.7 hours at 25 \u00b0C. Aqueous solutions of the sodium salt undergo alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis to the hydroxyl form. Occupational exposure to chlorambucil may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chlorambucil is produced or used. Exposure to chlorambucil among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug (Leukeran), a selective antineoplastic. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase chlorambucil is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 hour(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.9X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase chlorambucil may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). Chlorambucil exhibits an absorption maximum in water of 256 nm(4), and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

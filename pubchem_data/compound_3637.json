The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

There are 5 identified metabolic pathways for hydralazine.  Hydralazine can be metabolized to phthalazine or \u03b1-ketoglutarate hydrazone. These metabolites can be further converted to phthalazinone or hydralazine can be metabolized directly to phthalazinone.  Hydralazine can undergo a reversible converstion to the active hydralazine acetone hydrazone.  Hydralazine is spontaneously converted to the active pyruvic acid hydrazone or the pyruvic acid hydrazone tricyclic dehydration product, and these metabolites can convert back and forth between these 2 forms.  Hydralazine can be converted to hydrazinophthalazinone, which is further converted to the active acetylhydrazinophthalazinone.  The final metabolic process hydralazine can undergo is the conversion to an unnamed hydralazine metabolite, which is further metabolized to 3-methyl-s-triazolophthalazine (MTP). MTP can be metabolized to 9-hydroxy-methyltriazolophthalazine or 3-hydroxy-methyltriazolophthalazine; the latter is converted to triazolophthalazine.",

The interference with calcium transport may be by preventing influx of calcium into cells, preventing calcium release from intracellular compartments, directly acting on actin and myosin, or a combination of these actions. This decrease in vascular resistance leads to increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output.  Hydralazine also competes with protocollagen prolyl hydroxylase (CPH) for free iron. This competition inhibits CPH mediated hydroxylation of HIF-1\u03b1, preventing the degradation of HIF-1\u03b1.

However, hydralazine has been clearly linked to cases of acute liver injury with jaundice as well as a delayed lupus-like syndrome. Two clinical patterns of hepatic injury have been described, associated with either a short (2 to 6 weeks) or long (2 months to more than a year) latency period. The clinically apparent liver injury is usually hepatocellular, although cholestatic forms have also been reported (Case 1). In cases with a short latency period, rash, fever and eosinophilia are common and the onset is typically abrupt and severe, and recovery is rapid. In cases with a longer latency (Case 2), the onset is more typically insidious, liver biopsy may resemble chronic hepatitis and demonstrate fibrosis, and autoantibodies are often present. The late form of hepatitis may also accompany the lupus-like syndrome that occurs with hydralazine, particularly in high doses when given for 6 months or more. Recovery can be prolonged. Autoantibodies to isoforms of the P450 system (CYP 1A2) have been identified in patients with hepatotoxicity due to the structurally related antihypertensive agent dihydralazine (available in Europe, but not the United States) and which is associated with a higher rate of hepatotoxicity than hydralazine.",

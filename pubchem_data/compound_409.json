This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

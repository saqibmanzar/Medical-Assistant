When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).

Methylation is catalysed by thiopurine methyltransferase in the cytoplasm and thiol methyltransferase in microsomes, and both reactions require S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl group donor. Thiopurine methyltransferase is present in human liver, kidney, and erythrocytes; preferential substrates for this enzyme include aromatic and heterocyclic thiols. S-Methylation of aliphatic thiols is catalysed by microsomal thiol methyltransferase, and the resulting methyl thioether (sulfide) metabolite would undergo S-oxidation to give the methyl sulfoxide and methyl sulfone analogues as urinary products. Thiols may react with glutathione and other endogenous thiol substances to form mixed disulfides. Both microsomal and cytoplasmic thioltransferasess have been reported to catalyse the formation of mixed disulfides. The resulting mixed disulfides can undergo reduction back to thiols, oxidative desulfuration, or oxidation to a sulfonic acid via the intermediate thiosulfinate and sulfinic acids. The principal form in the circulation would probably be a mixed disulfide formed with albumin. /Simple thiols/",

The sulfur /containing/ cmpd are trapped and concentrated at -196 \u00b0C in a small glass tube filled with porous polymer Tenax GC. The excess of water in the air samples is pretrapped by calcium chloride, a drying agent does not adsorb any of the sulfur volatiles. The Texax trap tube fits exactly in the injection port of the gas chromatograph, where the adsorbed sulfur cmpd are liberated at 200 \u00b0C directly into the carrier gas stream and are transferred to the gas chromatographic column. The sulfur cmpd are then assayed by means of a flame photometric detector. The Tenax trap tubes can be stored at -196 \u00b0C for more than 1 wk without any loss of sulfur volatiles.",

Lower concentrations do not affect the cell morphology, viability or growth rate in any appreciable way. Both levamisole and OMPI, at low concentrations (10(-5)-10(-6) m), markedly enhance the antimicrotubular effect of mercaptoethanol. High concentrations of OMPI (+ or - 10(-4) M) inhibit the self-assembly of microtubules in a cell free system. Low concentrations (+ or - 10(-6) M) markedly enhance the polymerization rate of tubulin. Levamisole has no effect on tubulin polymerization. The effects of OMPI on microtubules in cells and in the polymerization system can be reversed by reduced glutathione, cysteine and dithiothreitol. The data indicate that OMPI interacts in a biphasic manner with microtubule formation probably through interaction with critical SH-groups on the tubulin molecule. It seems of interest to further investigate the hypothesis that the immunomodulating properties of levamisole are at least partially due to the formation of its metabolite (OMPI) which could enhance microtubule integrity and function in leukocytes.",

Lower alkyl mercaptans are found in manure gas from domestic animal pens, in various crude oils, and are formed by biological processes. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 277 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isopropyl mercaptan will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase isopropyl mercaptan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hours. Isopropyl mercaptan does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.  If released to soil, isopropyl mercaptan is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 35. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.6X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Isopropyl mercaptan may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, isopropyl mercaptan is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 3.5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to isopropyl mercaptan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isopropyl mercaptan is produced or used. Use data suggest that the general population may be exposed to isopropyl mercaptan via inhalation of ambient air in the vicinity of natural gas refineries and operations. (SRC)",

These values correspond to an atmospheric half-life of about 8 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The hydroxyl radical reaction proceeds primarily through OH addition to the sulfur(1); based upon chamber experiments with similar sulfur compounds(4), the reaction products may include isopropylsulfonic acid(SRC). Isopropyl mercaptan is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(5). Isopropyl mercaptan does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

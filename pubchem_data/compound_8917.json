When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

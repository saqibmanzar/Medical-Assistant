If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.4X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzylsulfonic acid will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzylsulfonic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 65 hrs. Particulate-phase benzylsulfonic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, Benzylsulfonic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 21. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Benzylsulfonic acid will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, Benzylsulfonic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

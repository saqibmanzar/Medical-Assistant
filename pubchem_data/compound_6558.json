For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Isobutylamine is a natural component of tobacco and has been detected in marine algae. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 138 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isobutylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase isobutylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hours. Isobutylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isobutylamine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 60. The pKa of isobutylamine is 10.68 indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon its cation state. Isobutylamine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Isobutylamine was 87 percent and 68 percent biodegraded during a 2 week incubation period using a Japanese MITI test, suggesting that biodegradation may occur in the soil and water. If released into water, isobutylamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A pKa of 10.68 indicates isobutylamine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to isobutylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isobutylamine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to isobutylamine through the ingestion of food and the use of tobacco products. (SRC)",

The pKa of isobutylamine is 10.68(4) indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization of isobutylamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process given its cation state(SRC). Isobutylamine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(6).

Vapor-phase isobutylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hours(SRC) from its estimated rate constant of 3.4X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The presence of volatile aliphatic amines ... in human breast milk and amniotic fluid /was measured/ to assess their role in neonatal hypergastrinemia. These volatile nitrogenous amino acid metabolites have been previously demonstrated to stimulate gastrin release in in vivo and in vitro laboratory preparations. ... The present study ... demonstrated that these gastrin-stimulatory volatile amines were present in significant concentrations in breast milk during the first several weeks after parturition and in amniotic fluid. The individual amines that were identified in both human milk and amniotic fluid samples were methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, trimethylamine, propylamine, isobutylamine, and butylamine. This study provides indirect evidence to support the possibility that the hypergastrinemia measured in the fetus/neonate during the period immediately before and after birth may be attributable, in part, to the ingestion of fluid containing high concentrations of gastrin-stimulating amines.",

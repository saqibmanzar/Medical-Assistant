When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Analysis of the urinary radioactivity revealed that most of administered 14C-ODM was not metabolized. The respective % for males and females of unmetabolized ODM were 43% and 47% for the 1 mg/kg, iv group; 38% and 47% for the 1 mg/kg, po group; 34% and 55% for the repeat, 1 mg/kg/day, po group; and 59% and 74% for the 20 mg/kg, po group. Two major metabolites and three minor ones were also identified. One major metabolite was identified as 2- (ethylsulfinyl)-1-(methylsulfinyl) ethane, and accounted for 18-21% of the administered dose at 1 mg/kg, iv; 24-25%, at 1 mg/kg, po; 15%, at 15 x 1 mg/kg/day, po; and 5-6%, at 20 mg/kg, po. The second major metabolite was identified as 2-(ethylsulfonyl)-1-(methylsulfinyl) ethane; this metabolite accounted for 11-19% of the administered dose at 1 mg/kg, iv; 16-20%, at 1 mg/kg, po; 12-23%, at 15 x 1 mg/kg/day, po; and 6-19%, at 20 mg/kg, po. One minor metabolite (as a % of the administered dose for both males and females) was identified as ODM sulfone and was present at 1.7-3.4% of the total administered dose at 1 mg/kg, iv; 1.6%, at 1 mg/kg, po; 2.4-2.6%, at 15 x 1 mg/kg/day, po; and 2.6-3.9%, at 20 mg/kg, po. Two other minor metabolites were identified as desmethyl ODM and desmethyl ODM sulfone and were detected only in the 20 mg/kg, po, group at 2.6-3.1% and 1.0-3.1%, respectively. Primary fecal metabolites included unmetabolized ODM (0.2%), ODM sulfide (0.8%) and ODM sulfone (0.2%). The differences in the metabolic profiles suggests that the biotransformation may be saturated at high doses. The results indicate that at 20 mg/kg a marked increase in urinary excretion of unmetabolized parent compound (59-74%) in conjunction with a marked decline in the urinary excretion of metabolites compared to the corresponding values for males and female rats receiving 1 mg/kg (excretion of unmetabolized parent: 34-55%)."

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The rate of lipid peroxidation and lipase activity showed dose-dependent increase in different regions of the CNS.

Remember that atropine can be administered through an endotracheal tube if initial IV access if difficult to obtain. Depending on the severity of poisoning, doses of atropine ranging from very low to...high... . The objective of atropine antidotal therapy is to antagonize the effects of excessive concentrations of acetylcholine at end-organs having muscarinic receptors. Atropine does not reactivate the cholinesterase enzyme or accelerate disposition of organophosphate. Recrudescence of poisoning may occur if tissue concentrations of organophosphate remain high when the effect of atropine wears off. Atropine is effective against muscarinic manifestations, but it is ineffective against nicotinic actions, specifically muscle weakness and twitching, and respiratory depression. Despite the limitations, atropine is often a life-saving agent in organophosphate poisonings. Favorable response to a test dose of atropine can help differentiate poisoning by anticholinesterase agents from other conditions. However, lack of response, with no evidence of atropinization (atropine refractoriness) is typical of more severe poisonings. The adjunctive use of nebulized atropine has been reported to improve respiratory distress, decrease bronchial secretions, and increase oxygenation. ...Do not administer atropine or pralidoxime prophylactically to workers exposed to organophosphate pesticides. Prophylactic dosage with either atropine or pralidoxime may mask early signs and symptoms of organophosphate poisoning and thus allow the worker to continue exposure and possibly progress to more severe poisoning. Atropine itself may enhance the health hazards of the agricultural work setting: impaired heat loss due to reduced sweating and impaired ability to operate mechanical equipment due to blurred vision. This can be caused by mydriasis, one of the effects of atropine. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

During this study, atropine was used as a bolus for a heart rate less than 60 beats/min. The other apparent advantage to this regimen was a decreased number of respiratory infections. This may represent an alternative when there is a concern for respiratory infection due to excessive and difficult to control secretions, and in the presence of altered level of consciousness where the distinction between atropine toxicity or relapse of organophosphate poisoning is unclear. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

Before administration of pralidoxime, draw a blood sample (heparinized) for cholinesterase analysis (since pralidoxime tends to reverse the cholinesterase depression). Administration pralidoxime (Protopam, 2-PAM), a cholinesterase reactivator, in cases of severe poisoning by organophosphate pesticides in which respiratory depression, muscle weakness, and/or twitching are severe. When administered early (usually less than 48 hours after poisoning) pralidoxime relieves the nicotinic as well as the muscarinic effects of poisoning. Pralidoxime works by reactivating the cholinesterase and also by slowing the \"aging\" process of phosphorylated cholinesterase to a non-reactivatable form. ... Dosage of pralidoxime may be repeated in 1-2 hours, then at 10-12 hour intervals if needed. In very severe poisonings, dosage rates may be doubled. Repeated doses of pralidoxime are usually required. In cases that involve continuing absorption of organophosphate (as after ingestion of large amounts), or continuing transfer of highly lipophilic organophosphate from fat into blood, it may be necessary to continue administration of pralidoxime for several days beyond the 48 hour post-exposure interval usually cited as the limit of its effectiveness. ... Blood pressure should be monitored during administration because of the occasional occurrence of hypertensive crisis. Administration should be slowed or stopped if blood pressure rises to hazardous levels. Be prepared to assist pulmonary ventilation mechanically if respiration is depressed during or after pralidoxime administration. If intravenous injection is not possible, pralidoxime may be given by deep intramuscular injection. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

Physiological variations in blood ChE levels occur in a healthy person and are seen among a population. It has been estimated that the coefficient of variation for AChE activity in samples from an individual is 8-11%, and that a decrease of 23% below pre-exposure level may, therefore, be considered significant. If the average of several pre-exposure values were available, then a decrease of 17% would be significant. It has been recommended that, if measured activity is reduced by 30% or more of the pre-exposure value, AChE measurements should be repeated at appropriate intervals to confirm the results. Depressions of AChE or ChE in excess of 20-25% are considered diagnostic of exposure but not, necessarily, indicative of hazard. Depressions of 30-50% or more are considered indicators for removal of an exposed individual from further contact with pesticides until levels return to normal. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/"

Advances in gas chromatography and combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) have made it possible to analyse the urine of exposed persons for the presence of appropriate metabolites. It is usually necessary to preserve the sample by the addition of chloroform, to concentrate or extract the metabolite(s), and to convert them to suitably-volatile derivatives that can be detected by GC. Obviously, access to a well-equipped analytical laboratory, capable of the quick processing of samples, is a necessary factor if monitoring by urine analysis is proposed. However, in some cases, simpler and sensitive colorimetric tests are available for screening the urine of exposed persons. Thus, 4-nitrophenol can be measured directly in the urine of workers exposed to parathion. Consideration of the concentration of metabolite(s) in the urine can be helpful in determining patterns of exposure, and these concentrations can be calibrated against the effects on AChE for a particular pesticide. However, the time-course and peak of excretion of metabolites appears to vary according to dose, so that serial sampling and analyses of urine are desirable. Levels of metabolite alone cannot be considered a guide to hazard. This is obvious when it is realized that pesticides that have very different toxicities may yield identical acidic metabolites. Thus, the level of metabolites in urine, after exposure to sufficient amounts of the very toxic parathion-methyl to depress blood-AChE to 50%, will be much lower than that of the identical metabolites, following exposure to the related fenitrothion, which is about 40 times less toxic. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/",

Prior to the start of the study, all subjects were given physical, hematological and urological exams. Plasma and erythrocyte ChE activities were determined prior to dosing to establish the mean activity and standard deviation for each subject; these values were used as the control values. ODM was administered orally using either undiluted in gelatin capsules or diluted with 25 mL of corn oil. In a pilot study, a single subject was treated at 0.4 mg/kg/day for 5 days; this subject formed the basis for the dose levels used in the study. For acute toxicity, 7 subjects were treated with ODM, each received a dose of 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/kg. For these subjects, ChE activities were measured at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 24 hr, with additional measurements at 48 and 60 hr for subjects treated at 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg. For the subchronic portion of the study, ChE activities were evaluated in 4 subjects treated at 0.05 mg/kg/day for 25-30 days and 2 subjects treated for 60 days. A single subject was treated for 120 days at 0.1 mg/kg/day. In the pilot study, a single subject was dosed at 0.4 mg/kg/day for 5 days. At 24 hr post dosing, plasma and erythrocyte ChE activities were inhibited by 50% and 35%, respectively. Findings of the acute toxicity study showed that the NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg for both plasma and erythrocyte ChE. At 1.0 mg/kg plasma ChE was inhibited by about 18% and erythrocyte ChE by about 14%. For the subacute study, volunteers treated at 0.05 mg/kg/day for 30-60 days, did not result in inhibition of either plasma or erythrocyte ChE. Treatment at 0.1 mg/kg/day for 120 days, resulted in a progressive inhibition of ChE activities. Plasma ChE was inhibited by 40% within the first 2 wk of exposure; erythrocyte ChE was also progressively inhibited, reaching a plateau of 50% by day 60 of the 120 day exposure. No cholinergic signs were noted in any of the subjects at anytime. Based on the results of this study (inhibition of plasma ChE by 18% and erythrocyte ChE by 14%), the acute LOEL was established at 1.0 mg/kg. The NOEL was established at 0.5 mg/kg. The LOEL for subacute toxicity was established at 0.1 mg/kg/day, based on one subject showing 40% inhibition of plasma ChE at two weeks and 50% inhibition of erythrocyte ChE at 60 days. The subacute NOEL was established at 0.05 mg/kg/day, based on no effects in 6 subjects at this dose."

No effects were seen on body weight or food consumption. No treatment-related effects were seen during clinical observations or necropsy. At day 0, no biologically significant inhibition of plasma or erythrocyte ChE activities were seen in any of the treated males and females. On day 7, only animals in the high-dose group had significant inhibition of plasma (38% in males and 40% in females) and erythrocyte (26% in males and 40% in females) ChE activity. At day 14, high-dose males showed significant inhibition of 37% for erythrocyte ChE, while high-dose females showed significant inhibition of 55% for plasma and 46% for erythrocyte ChE activities. Brain ChE activity, measured at day 14, was significantly inhibited in mid- and high-dose males (12 and 48%, respectively) and low-, mid- and high-dose females (11, 16 and 60%, respectively). The LOEL was established at 0.3 mg/kg/day in females and 1.0 mg/kg/day in males, based on inhibition of brain ChE in females (11%) and males (12%). The NOEL was not established in females, while the NOEL was established at 0.3 mg/kg/day in males.",

The animals were exposed to both treated and untreated alfalfa at an application rate of 2.25 lb ai/A, applied 3 times with a 2 wk application interval. The caged animals were placed on alfalfa plots for 6 weeks; they were moved to fresh alfalfa plots weekly which had received previous applications. There was no treatment-related mortality of quail during the 42 day study. Weight losses for both treated and control birds were equivalent. The treated rabbits had no toxic symptoms or deaths, although one control rabbit died. There were high mortalities of control and treated sparrows, particularly during the last week of the study. The high death rate was attributed to stress due to being caged over an extended period of time. The data indicate that a formulated product of ODM, metasystox-r, was not significantly hazardous to caged bobwhite quail, English sparrows, and New Zealand rabbits. However, issues such as repellency were not considered. Without knowing the sizes of the cages, it is difficult to know if the animals were adequately exposed to treated food.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.85X10-5 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates oxydemeton-methyl will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase oxydemeton-methyl will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.6 hours. Particulate-phase oxydemeton-methyl will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, oxydemeton-methyl is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 9. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.62X10-13 atm-cu m/mole. Percent degradation of oxydemeton-methyl after 14 days ranged from 65-99% by various soil microorganisms. If released into water, oxydemeton-methyl is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. At 22 \u00b0C the half-lives for hydrolysis of oxydememton-methyl are estimated as 107, 46, and 2 days at pH 4, 7, and 9, respectively.  Occupational exposure to oxydemeton-methyl may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where oxydemeton-methyl is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to oxydemeton-methyl via ingestion of food. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

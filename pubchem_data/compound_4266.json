This action of the drug is paradoxical since local microiontophoretic application of the drug is associated with a clearcut inhibition of these neurons. ... An attempt was made to analyze the mechanism of this action of the drug /in this study/. Administration of muscimol (0.25-4.0 mg/kg, iv) was associated with a dose-dependent increase in firing rate as well as an increased bursting activity of the nigral DA neurons. Both these effects of muscimol were clearly antagonised by intravenous administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK 801(1 mg/kg) or by intracerebroventricular administration of the broad-spectrum excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist kynurenic acid. Furthermore, pretreatment with PNU 156561A (40 mg/kg, iv, 5-8 ht), a compound that raised endogenous kynurenic acid levels about 9 times, also clearly antagonized the actions of muscimol. Indeed, this treatment reversed the excitatory action of muscimol into an inhibitory effect on the nigral DA neurons. Here, /it is reported/ that the excitatory action of muscimol is mediated indirectly by release of glutamate.",

Fos-like immunoreactivity in the mamillary body and the anterior thalamus /was examined/ following unilateral injections of ...  muscimol into the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden (VTN). These injections resulted in a marked increase in Fos-like immunoreactivity ipsilaterally in both the medial mamillary nucleus and in its principle thalamic projection targets, the anteroventral and anteromedial thalamic nuclei. Since the projection from the VTN to the mamillary body has been shown to contain a substantial GABAergic component, these results are likely to reflect a disinhibition of mamillothalamic circuitry resulting from suppression of tonic inhibitory inputs arising in the VTN.",

MUS and IBO were extracted from mushrooms by aqueous methanol and derivatized with dansyl chloride (DNS-Cl). After extraction with ethyl acetate and evaporation of the solvent, the residue was ethylated with 1.25 M hydrogen chloride in ethanol. The resulting derivatives were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection and identified by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were linear in the range of 25-2500 ppm for MUS and 40-2500 ppm for IBO, respectively. This method was successfully applied to identify and quantify MUS and IBO in Amanita mushrooms naturally grown and circulated in the drug market.",

In comparison to control rats which received only muscimol, in rats pretreated with diazepam (1 mg/kg/day for 30 consecutive days) the behavioral and electrocorticogram effects of muscimol were significantly reduced or abolished. In fact, in rats pretreated with diazepam a small dose (50 ng) of muscimol did not affect behavior or electrocorticogram activity, in contrast to control animals in which the same dose produced, after a period of locomotor stimulation and electrocorticogram desynchronization, typical and long-lasting behavioral sedation or sleep accompanied by a significant increase in total voltage power and in the lower frequency bands in the electrocorticogram. In addition, larger doses (100 and 200 ng) of muscimol, which in control rats produced a typical biphasic pattern of electrocorticogram and behavioral changes, ie an initial period of electrocorticogram desynchronization and behavioral stimulation, followed by a second period of behavioral and electrocorticogram sleep, in animals pretreated with diazepam, produced only an increase in total voltage power and in the lower frequency bands in the electrocorticogram resembling the effects of the small (50 ng) dose. The present experiments suggest that, after chronic stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors a decrease in sensitivity of receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid occurs, since the effects of muscimol on behavior and spectrum power were significantly reduced or abolished.",

Animals tested 48 hr after ethanol inhalation exhibited a reduced sleep time from ethanol (4.0 g/kg). muscimol (1.75 mg/kg) was administered along with ethanol 48 hr following 1 day of ethanol inhalation.

Chemically stimulating the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), a brain region known to be involved in thermoregulation and in stress responses, causes similar effects. ...Therefore ...  the hypothesis that neuronal activity in the DMH plays a role in MDMA-evoked sympathetic and behavioral responses /was tested/ by microinjecting artificial CSF or muscimol, a neuronal inhibitor, into the DMH prior to intravenous infusion of saline or MDMA in conscious rats. Core temperature, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and locomotor activity were recorded by telemetry every minute for 120 min. In rats previously microinjected with CSF, MDMA elicited significant increases from baseline in core temperature (+1.3+/-0.3 degrees C), locomotion (+50+/-6 counts/min), heart rate (+142+/-16 beats/min), and mean arterial pressure (+26+/-3 mmHg). Microinjecting muscimol into the DMH prior to MDMA prevented increases in core temperature and locomotion and attenuated increases in heart rate and mean arterial pressure. ...",

One to four mushrooms cause euphoria, a sense of lightness, colored visions, and visual hallucinations. Although muscarine is a constituent of these mushrooms, there is no constriction of the pupils in this poisoning. Instead there is mydriasis, which is thought to be a sympathetic effect from action on the CNS. Muscimol, and to a minor degree, ibotenic acid are believed to be the constituents largely responsible. No persistent ocular disturbances have been reported. /Amanita muscaria/",

Specimens of the fly agaric found in the eastern USA (especially the yellow variety) are said to be much less psychoactive than those collected in the west. Only rarely does Amanita muscaria anywhere contain enough muscarine to produce mild muscarnic effects; unknown irritants rather than muscarine are believed to be responsible for much of the nausea and vomiting. Deaths from these mushrooms are very rare, but as with some other types of fleshy fungi, children have been known to react in unexpected and dangerous ways (eg, convulsions). Adults rarely require drug treatment for muscimol-ibotenic acid poisoning. Atropine is said to make the delirium worse, and physostigmine is ineffective. /Amanita muscaria/",

At least 3 days separated consecutive treatments. Muscimol elicited a dose dependent incr in locomotor activity in all three areas, as measured in infrared photocell boxes. All 3 doses of muscimol injected into the median raphe resulted in significant hyperactivity relative to saline baselines. In contrast, only the 100 ng dose produced significant effects in animals with cannulae in the dorsal raphe or caudal ventral tegmental area. No significant effects were seen with injections into the rostral portion of the ventral tegmental area or the midline pontine tegmentum caudal to the median raphe.

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The peak area of acetone as a chief product in the thermal decomposition was related to di-t-butyl peroxide concentration in a linear manner. The range was from 22.91 to 114.93 ug (r=0.9997, n=4). By use of the calibration, we can possibly determine the content of the peroxide rapidly. The present method is more suitable for the determination of peroxide that is liable to decompose and difficult to be vaporized.",

It has a population density of 1000 per square mile versus 26 for the entire State of Texas.  ... commercial quantities of peroxide are refrigerated continuously to prevent temperature increase and rapid decomposition.  Loss of refrigeration systems for an \"extended\" period of time can result in massive decomposition and fire in peroxide storage tanks. This is where things went wrong at the Arkema Corporation Plant that manufactures a large number of liquid organic peroxides in Crosby, Texas. Hurricane Harvey flooded this Plant where over one half million pounds of peroxides were stored.  Water destroyed the plant's electrical systems and backups thus shutting down refrigeration. \"Fearing that the chemicals might explode the Arkema workers, as a last resort, transferred the peroxides to nine refrigerated trailers on the property.  All but one of the refrigeration units on those trailers eventually failed, the company said.\" Out of fear of explosions the workers had to abandon the plant on August 29, resolved to allow explosions take place and peroxides burn. A perimeter of 1.5 miles around the plant was evacuated due to the various hazards. As time passed trailers warmed up and they exploded one by one and caught fire. Billowing thick black smoke and noxious gases were released every time a tanker exploded and burnt.  Scores of police officers and others were sent to hospital.",

It is used as a polymerization catalyst for resins, including olefins, styrene, styrenated alkyds, and silicones. It is also used as an ignition accelerator for diesel fuel, and an organic synthesis intermediate. HUMAN STUDIES: Workers engaged in the production of organic peroxides suffered from grippe, angina, acute respiratory diseases, and pneumonia. ANIMAL STUDIES: Tumorigenic response after exposure of di-tert-butyl peroxide at a single dose of 100 umol to 50 mice consisted of 7 animals with malignant lymphomas and 1 animal with pulmonary adenomas out of 35 survivors. Di-t-butyl peroxide, which was essentially inactive in short-term in vitro promotion assays, was also totally inactive in promoting papillomas or carcinomas in initiated skin. Chromosome breakage has been detected using tert-butyl peroxide. The mutagenicity of di-t-butyl peroxide was tested using Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 in the presence of metabolic activation. No mutagenic activity was observed with di-t-butyl peroxide.",

Two of the compounds (di-t-butyl peroxide and dicumyl peroxide) were dialkyl peroxides and the other (di-m-chlorobenzoyl peroxide) was a diacyl peroxide. These compounds were selected based on a previous study in which we evaluated their capacity to induce epidermal hyperplasia, ornithine decarboxylase activity, and dark basal keratinocytes, which have been reliable short-term markers of tumor promotion. Dicumyl peroxide was a weak tumor promoter despite its high activity in inducing hyperplasia. Like benzoyl peroxide, di-m-chlorobenzoyl peroxide generally had intermediate activity as an inducer of short-term markers of tumor promotion and was a moderately effective tumor promoter. However, compared to benzoyl peroxide, di-m-chlorobenzoyl peroxide was more toxic to the skin, which may have limited its tumor-promoting activity. The final compound, di-t-butyl peroxide, which was essentially inactive in short-term assays, was also totally inactive in promoting papillomas or carcinomas in initiated skin. Tumor-promoting efficacy generally showed an inverse association with thermal stability for the compounds tested, suggesting that the rate of formation of free radicals is a key factor contributing to tumor promotion by organic peroxides. However, a number of other factors can potentially affect the activity of different organic peroxides as tumor promoters. Each compound evaluated had a different spectrum of activities, and these compounds should be useful for studying mechanisms of organic peroxide-induced tumor promotion.",

Doses ranged up to 40 mg in the single dose study and up to 60 mg in the multiple dose experiment. The mice were killed 0.25 to 7 days after the last treatment and the skins were removed. The tumor promoting potential of the chemicals was assessed by determining epidermal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and induction of epidermal hyperplasia and dark band keratinocytes. Attempts were made to correlate the data with the temperature at which the compounds had a half life of 10 hr (10 hr Tl/2), a measure of thermal stability. After single application, MCPBA showed the greatest tumor promotion potential, followed by DMBP, Luperox, Lupersol, benzoyl peroxide, DCBP, DTBP, and TBHP in that order. Luperox was the most active in the multiple dosing study, followed by DMBP, Lupersol, MCPBA, DCBP, TBHP, benzoyl peroxide, and DTBP in that order. The tumor promotion activity of the compounds did not correlate with their 10 hr Tl/2. The /results indicate/ that the tumor promotion potential of the peroxides cannot be explained on the basis of their stability.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 25.1 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 days. Bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide absorbs at wavelengths 340 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 620. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.0483 atm-cu m/mole. Bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide is may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. Organic peroxides, such as bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide, are strong oxidizers and may ignite organic materials in soil and water on contact. If released into water, bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hrs and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 88 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. A hydrolysis half-life of one year has been reported. Occupational exposure to bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide is produced or used.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.0483 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 25.1 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 100 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hrs and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 88(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 32.45(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks(7) indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Organic peroxides, such as bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide, are strong oxidizers and may ignite organic materials in water on contact(8).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 15 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide has a reported hydrolysis half-life of 1 years at 25 \u00b0C(2). Bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide absorbs UV light at wavelengths of 340 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). The compound photolyzes to form two t-butoxy radicals(3,4). The t-butoxy radical is unstable and decomposes to form acetone and methyl radicals. A host of other products result from free radical reactions including t-butanol, methyl t-butyl ether, isobutylene oxide, ethane, and methane(3,4). Organic peroxides, such as bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)peroxide, are strong oxidizers and may ignite organic materials in soil and water on contact(5).",

These reactions also liberate heat, thus further accelerating the decomposition. Commercial products often contain diluents that desensitize neat peroxides to these hazards. Commercial organic peroxide decompositions are low order deflagrations rather than detonations. /Organic peroxides/"

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

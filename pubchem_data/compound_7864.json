Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Ethyl, isobutyl, ethyl tert-butyl, and ethyl tert-pentyl ether are particularly hazardous in this respect. Ether peroxides can sometimes be observed as clear crystals deposited on containers or along the surface of the liquid. Ethers can act as bases. They form salts with strong acids and addition complexes with Lewis acids. The complex between diethyl ether and boron trifluoride is an example. Ethers may react violently with strong oxidizing agents. In other reactions, which typically involve the breaking of the carbon-oxygen bond, ethers are relatively inert.",

Based upon the lack of persistence of BCME /bis(chloromethyl) ether/ and CMME /chloromethyl methyl ether/ in the environment, average human exposure to these compounds is likely to be very low. ... General population exposure to BCME and CMME occurs where they are produced by the widespread burning of this synergist in mosquito coils. ...Quantitative information on the kinetics and metabolism ... in humans is not available. However, it is anticipated that although in vivo BCME and CMME would be rapidly hydrolyzed in tissues to formaldehyde and hydrogen chloride, and methanol, formaldehyde and hydrogen chloride, respectively, there should be alkylation activity. ... BCME and CMME are acutely toxic by inhalation or ingestion. ...During inhalation of BCME /in laboratory animal studies/, irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract were noted as well as necrotizing bronchitis. Skin application resulted in erythema and necrosis, and application to the eye resulted in corneal necrosis. Similar effects were noted after exposure to CMME. Increased mortality and tracheal hyperplasia were observed in rats and hamsters following multiple inhalation exposure to ... BCME ... Similar results were observed in rats repeatedly exposed by inhalation to ... CMME ... In general, positive results were obtained when ... tested for mutagenicity in vitro. ... BCME and CMME have been reported to increase unscheduled DNA synthesis in vitro ... Studies with CMME have shown an increased incidence of tracheal metaplasia and bronchial hyperplasia in a dose-dependent manner in rats. However, results of carcinogenicity bioassays are inconclusive in animal studies. ... Exposure of workers to BCME (CMME) was associated with increased risk of lung cancer. Workers exposed to commercial grade CMME were probably also exposed to BCME. The predominant tumors in exposed workers were small cell carcinomas, quite distinct from the chiefly squamous cell carcinomas usually found in smokers. The association between exposure to BCME (CMME) and lung cancer was strong ... The type of lung cancer, latency period and average age of appearance of lung tumors in workers exposed to BCME (CMME) has been remarkably consistent. For CMME, there is also evidence of a positive relationship between a qualitative measure of exposure and mortality due to lung cancer. ... Concentrations /of BCME and CMME/ ... in the course of occupational exposure increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral lymphocytes of exposed workers. Information has not been reported regarding the neurological, immunological, developmental or reproductive effects of BCME or CMME in humans. ... No information on the toxicological effects of BCME and CMME on environmental organisms has been reported.",

The hydrolysis half-life of chloromethyl methyl ether in humid air was determined to be 3.5-6 min in one study(3) and 6.5 hr in another(1). Results suggest that the reaction is humid air surface catalyzed(2). If this is so, laboratory data would only indicate a lower limit for lifetimes in the environment(4). The hydrolysis reaction products include methanol, formaldehyde, and HCl(1). The rate constant for reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated to be 2.3X10-12 cu-cm/molecule sec at 25 \u00b0C(5), which corresponds to an estimated half-life of 7 days based on a hydroxyl radical concentration of 5X10+5 molecules/sec(SRC).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

In this first step oligomeric cyanoacrylates, water, and other byproducts are formed. The reaction can be catalyzed by bases (e.g., amines), alkali metal tetraborates, metal carbonyls, or phase-transfer catalysts. The raw condensation product from the first reaction is depolymerized thermally (either continuously or discontinuously) and purified by distillation, chromatography on alumina or silica gel, crystallization in polyethylene columns, or treatment with zinc chloride. Alternatively, 2-cyanoacrylates can be manufactured by the ethoxycarbonylation of cyanoacetylene in the presence of nickel carbonyl. /2-Cyanoacrylates/",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Nitriles may polymerize in the presence of metals and some metal compounds. They are incompatible with acids; mixing nitriles with strong oxidizing acids can lead to extremely violent reactions. Nitriles are generally incompatible with other oxidizing agents such as peroxides and epoxides. The combination of bases and nitriles can produce hydrogen cyanide. Nitriles are hydrolyzed in both aqueous acid and base to give carboxylic acids (or salts of carboxylic acids). These reactions generate heat. Peroxides convert nitriles to amides. Nitriles can react vigorously with reducing agents. Acetonitrile and propionitrile are soluble in water, but nitriles higher than propionitrile have low aqueous solubility. They are also insoluble in aqueous acids. Esters react with acids to liberate heat along with alcohols and acids. Strong oxidizing acids may cause a vigorous reaction that is sufficiently exothermic to ignite the reaction products. Heat is also generated by the interaction of esters with caustic solutions. Flammable hydrogen is generated by mixing esters with alkali metals and hydrides.",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

The study involved the use of an exposure chamber; however, due to the difficulties in generating MCA exposure atmospheres, exposure was achieved via a simulated work procedure in which the subjects applied the adhesive to microscope slides or other glass sheets. ... The operations were graduated so as to produce vapor concentrations ranging from 1 to 60 ppm (4.5 to 272 mg/cu m). Air samples were taken in the breathing zone of each individual with sampling periods of 5 min, and collection was repeated 10 times/hr for the duration of the study. ... Subjects filled in a questionnaire at the end of each 5-min sampling period to indicate odor perception and irritancy responses. In preliminary trials marked eye and nose irritation were reported at 40 to 60 ppm (182-272 mg/cu m). For two individuals, blurred vision was reported some time after the exposure and persisted for approximately 2 hr. Fourteen individuals participated in the main study, with some performing the simulated occupational tasks more than once; adhesives were applied dropwise onto glass slides using a syringe or directly from the adhesive container. These procedures are a closer simulation of many of the occupational uses of the cyanoacrylate adhesives than was the preliminary study. ... No effects were reported in any of the 14 subjects at 1 ppm (4.5 mg/cu m). The odor threshold was reported to be 1 to 5 ppm (4.5 to 23 mg/cu m). Throat and nose \"irritation\" were subjectively reported from 2 to 20 ppm (9.1 to 91 mg/cu m) or more, although the severity was unclear (at 2 ppm [9.1 mg/cu m], ...no more than 3 of the 14 people reported effects). Eye irritation and \"burning\" were reported from 4 to 15 ppm (18 to 68 mg/cu m) or more, although ... it is impossible to tell exactly what proportion of volunteers reported effects. At concentrations above 20 ppm (91 mg/cu m), lacrimation and rhinorrhea were reported (except for one individual in whom rhinorrhea was reported at around 7 ppm [32 mg/cu m]), and these were more pronounced at 50 to 60 ppm (227-272 mg/cu m) (a level at which painful eye irritation was also reported). The study report suffers from a number of limitations. ... Despite these limitations, it is possible to identify a NOAEL for irritancy due to MCA vapor of 1 ppm (4.5 mg/cu m) from this study. At around 2 ppm (9.1 mg/cu m), the nasal and throat effects were of unclear severity in no more than 3 of the 14 volunteers, with marked effects (rhinorrhea and lacrimation) at around 20 ppm (91 mg/cu m) or more.",

Irritation of the upper respiratory tract caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the respiratory rate. The maximum effect occurred within the first 10 min of exposure and was followed by a drop-off in the response during the remainder of the exposure period. The airborne concentration resulting in a 50% decrease in the respiratory rate of mice (RD(50)) was calculated for each chemical. The results show that the four chemicals had similar irritant potencies. The RD(50) values of methyl-2-cyanoacrylate, ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate, isopropyl-2-cyanoacrylate and 2-methoxyethyl-2-cyanoacrylate were 1.4, 0.7, 0.6 and 1.0 p.p.m. Tentative estimates of threshold limit values showed that 0.1 RD(50) was closer to the values recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists for methyl- and ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate than 0.03 RD(50)...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl 2-cyanoacrylate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl 2-cyanoacrylate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.2 days. Methyl 2-cyanoacrylate is highly reactive and polymerizes rapidly on contact with moisture or other weakly basic substances; therefore, environmental processes such as volatilization from moist soil and water surfaces, biodegradation, and bioconcentration in aquatic organisms are not relevant for this substance. Methyl 2-cyanoacrylate contains chromophores that absorb strongly at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methyl 2-cyanoacrylate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3.7. However, movement of methyl 2-cyanoacrylate through soil will be hindered by its rapid polymerization as it comes into contact with moisture and other weakly basic substances. Methyl 2-cyanoacrylate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation is not an important environmental fate proces due to rapid polymerization. If released to water, methyl 2-cyanoacrylate's rapid polymerization on contact with moisture indicates that environmental processes such as volatilization from water surfaces and bioconcentration in aquatic organisms are not relevant. Occupational exposure to methyl 2-cyanoacrylate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl 2-cyanoacrylate is produced or used. Members of the general population may be exposed to methyl 2-cyanoacrylate via inhalation or dermal contact when using commercial cyanoacrylate adhesives.(SRC)",

Vapor-phase methyl 2-cyanoacrylate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.2 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.1X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Methyl 2-cyanoacrylate contains chromophores that absorb strongly at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

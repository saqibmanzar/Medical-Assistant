ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The chlorination reaction proceeds stepwise via benzyl chloride and benzal chloride. The benzotrichloride is then partially hydrolyzed with a limited amount of water. This series of reactions consumes a large quantity of chlorine. An alternative process uses benzoic acid. Phosphorous chlorides or iron chlorides are used as catalysts at the solvolytic stage of both processes. Benzoyl chloride can also be made by the reaction of benzoic acid with phosgene, thionyl chloride, or phosphorous pentachloride; chlorination of benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, or benzyl benzoate; and direct reaction of benzene with phosgene or the combination of carbon monoxide and chlorine. The benzoyl chloride prepared by the conventional processes may contain trace amounts of chlorobenzoyl chloride, but the product obtained by the reaction of molten phthalic anhydride with hydrogen chloride at 200 \u00b0C is free of such impurities.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used for for acylation (introduction of benzoyl group into alcohols, phenols, and amines). It is also used in the manufacture of benzoyl peroxide and of dye intermediates, and in organic analysis for making benzoyl derivates for identification purposes. HUMAN STUDIES: Benzoyl chloride has a corrosive effects on the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes by inhalation. It can cause cough, labored breathing, nausea, and sore throat after inhalation. Redness and irritant pain on contact with the eye and skin. Burning sensation, nausea and vomiting upon ingestion. Three  cases of lung cancer have been reported among workers engaged in production of benzoyl chloride. ANIMAL STUDIES: Benzoyl chloride was found to be corrosive to rabbit eyes. In male rats exposed to benzoyl chloride by inhalation signs of intoxication included inactivity, piloerection, unkempt fur, and difficulties in breathing up to 19 days post exposure in all rats. Rats that died during the test showed dark red colored lungs always with emphysema, some rats showed lung edema. Rats that survived showed no pathologic findings up to 0.708 mg/L. At higher concentrations lungs showed emphysema and were mottled, some showed enlarged adrenals. Benzoyl chloride was found to induce tumors in mice following inhalation exposure. Benzoyl chloride was positive in the bacterial gene mutation assay, preincubation method in Escherichia coli WP2uvrA/pKM101 with and without activation at concentrations up to 1000 ug/plate. Benzoyl chloride was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains His g46, His c3076, His d3052, TA1535, TA1536, TA1537, TA98 or TA100, nor in Escherichia coli strains Wp2 and Wp2 uvra- with or without metabolic activation. Benzoyl chloride was weakly mutagenic to Salmonella strain TA98 in the absence of metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: In a 96 hr lethality study with the Zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) no toxicity was found at 7.5 mg/L and all the fish died at 10 mg/L. Benzoyl chloride reacted with water to give benzoic acid and hydrogen chloride, causing a decrease in pH to 5.2 in freshwater and 7.2 in salt water. However, the biological oxygen demand of the benzoic acid was a far more serious effect. In the saltwater test of grass shrimp this was believed to be the major cause of mortality since dissolved oxygen levels plunged below 1 mg/L in direct correspondence to initial benzoyl chloride concentration.",

One group of males were exposed to an average concentration of 8.8 mg/kg and sacrificed 48 hr after dosing. BC was rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and efficiently eliminated in the urine (90%) and feces (2%) in 48 hr. Radioactivity in the blood (as BC equivalents) peaked at 4 ppm by 4 hr after dosing and then rapidly decreased to 0.02 ppm by 24 hr. The elimination half-life of (14)C in the blood was 1.5 hr. Total radiocarbon residue in tissues was approximately 1.5% of the dose after 72 hr with fat, liver, and kidneys containing the highest residue levels. The pharmacokinetics of BC appeared to follow a one-compartment open model system. BC was rapidly distributed in the body and the rate of elimination in the urine is proportional to the concentration of BC in the blood. At 8 hr, about 0.8% of the administered (14)C was present in the tissues. The radiocarbon elimination half-lives in the tissues ranged from 2.9-16.0 hr (brain, 16.0 hr, ovary, 10.1 hr).",

Test substance was added in the form of a stock solution in deionized water. Five fish were placed in each of two duplicate aquaria (10 fish/concentration). At 24 hr intervals, fish were observed for survival, and water tested for dissolved oxygen and temperature. At the end of the 96 hr exposure period, pH and test substance concentration was measured by electron capture gas chromatography (benzene: 15% ether extraction). With concentration versus mortality results, 96 hr LC50 and 95% confidence limits were calculated by Probit, Moving average, or Binomial test (depending on the number of partial kills observed). Benzoyl chloride reacted with water to give benzoic acid and HCl, causing a decrease in pH to 5.2 in freshwater and 7.2 in salt water. However, the biological oxygen demand of the benzoic acid was a far more serious effect. ... /The LC50 was calculated at 34.1 mg/L;/ 95% confidence interval = 28.5-45.3 mg/L.

Bioassay containers were filled with 12 liters of dilution water. Test substance was added in the form of a stock solution in deionized water. Five grass shrimp were placed in each of two duplicate aquaria (10 fish/concentration). At 24 hr intervals, grass shrimp were observed for survival, and water tested for dissolved oxygen and temperature. At the end of the 96 hr exposure period, pH and test substance concentration was measured by electron capture gas chromatography (benzene:15% ether extraction). With concentration versus mortality results, 96 hr LC50 and 95% confidence limits were calculated by Probit, Moving average, or Binomial test (depending on the number of partial kills observed). Benzoyl chloride reacted with water to give benzoic acid and HCl, causing a decrease in pH to 5.2 in freshwater and 7.2 in salt water. However, the biological oxygen demand of the benzoic acid was a far more serious effect. In the saltwater test of grass shrimp this was believed to be the major cause of mortality since dissolved oxygen levels plunged below 1 mg/L in direct correspondence to initial benzoyl chloride concentration.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzoyl chloride will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzoyl chloride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 days. Benzoyl chloride adsorbs light above 290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Hydrolysis is expected to be the most important environmental fate process for benzoyl chloride based on a hydrolysis rate constant of 4.2X10-2 sec-1 at 25 \u00b0C which corresponds to a half-life of 16 seconds. Absorption to soil and sediments, volatilization, biodegradation, leaching, and bioconcentration are not expected to occur in moist soil or water. However, benzoyl chloride has a vapor pressure of 0.7 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions: therefore, benzoyl chloride may volatilize from dry soil. In the absence of water, benzoyl chloride could form a variety of esters upon reaction with common soil constituents. Occupational exposure to benzoyl chloride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzoyl chloride is produced or used. The general population is not likely to be exposed to benzoyl chloride. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase benzoyl chloride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.8X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Benzoyl chloride exhibits an absorption maximum of 282.9 nm (Epsilon = 1752) and also absorption at 293.0 nm (Epsilon = 1108) in methyl cyclohexane(4). Benzoyl chloride in the vapor phase absorbs light from 225-292 nm, but only qualitative estimates of the absorption intensities (weak-strong) were given(4). This suggests that benzoyl chloride may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 9 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Benzoyl chloride is expected to hydrolyze on contact with moisture based on a hydrolysis rate constant of 4.2X10-2 sec-1 at 25 \u00b0C in water which corresponds to a half-life of 16 seconds(2). The hydrolysis products are benzoic acid and hydrochloric acid(3). Benzoyl chloride exhibits an absorption maximum of 282.9 nm (Epsilon = 1752) with absorption also at 293.0 nm (Epsilon = 1108) in methyl cyclohexane(4). Benzoyl chloride in the vapor phase absorbs light from 225-292 nm, but only qualitative estimates of the absorption intensities (weak-strong) were given(4). This suggests that benzoyl chloride may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

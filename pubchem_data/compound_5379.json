Gatifloxacin is available as tablets and in various aqueous solutions for intravenous therapy. It is also available as eye drops under the brand name Zymar\u00ae marketed by Allergan.  The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of non-ophthalmic drug products containing gatifloxacin due to the high prevalence of gatifloxacin-associated dysglycemia adverse event reports and the high incidence of hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes in patients taking gatifloxacin compared to those on macrolide antibiotics.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

                        "Description": "Infrared spectroscopy (IR spectroscopy) is the spectroscopy that deals with the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum extending from 780 nm to about 20000 nm.  The IR spectra tells you what types of vibrational mode (motion) responses occur in a molecule interacting with infrared light.  It is used to help determine the functional groups in a molecule.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

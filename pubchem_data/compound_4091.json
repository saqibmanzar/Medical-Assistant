Another well-known benefit of this drug is modest weight loss, making it an effective choice for obese patients type II diabetes.

Metformin is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent used for treating non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It improves glycemic control by decreasing hepatic glucose production, decreasing glucose absorption and increasing insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Metformin is the only oral antihyperglycemic agent that is not associated with weight gain. Metformin may induce weight loss and is the drug of choice for obese NIDDM patients. When used alone, metformin does not cause hypoglycemia; however, it may potentiate the hypoglycemic effects of sulfonylureas and insulin. Its main side effects are dyspepsia, nausea and diarrhea. Dose titration and/or use of smaller divided doses may decrease side effects. Metformin should be avoided in those with severely compromised renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), acute/decompensated heart failure, severe liver disease and for 48 hours after the use of iodinated contrast dyes due to the risk of lactic acidosis. Lower doses should be used in the elderly and those with decreased renal function. Metformin decreases fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Metformin may also have a positive effect on lipid levels. In 2012, a combination tablet of linagliptin plus metformin hydrochloride was marketed under the name Jentadueto for use in patients when treatment with both linagliptin and metformin is appropriate.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

                                            "String": "/BOXED WARNING/ Lactic Acidosis: Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 ug/mL are generally found.  The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients = 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure. The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.  Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling. Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).  Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP are dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.",

The risk of developing lactic acidosis is much lower (e.g., 10-fold lower) with metformin than with phenformin (no longer commercially available in the US). However, lactic acidosis constitutes a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization and treatment; in such cases, metformin should be discontinued and general supportive therapy (e.g., volume expansion, diuresis) should be initiated immediately. Prompt hemodialysis also is recommended. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (exceeding 45 mg/dL), decreased blood pH (less than 7.35), electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. Lactic acidosis also may occur in association with a variety of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever substantial tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia exist. Approximately 50% of cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have been reported to be fatal. However, it has been suggested that in such cases of lactic acidosis not accompanied by conditions predisposing to tissue anoxia (e.g., heart failure, renal or pulmonary disease), techniques for the elimination of metformin from the body may allow recovery rates exceeding 80%.",

Type II diabetes is characterized by a decrease in sensitivity to insulin, resulting in elevations in blood glucose when the pancreas can no longer compensate. In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, insulin is unable to exert adequate effects on tissues and cells (i.e. insulin resistance) and insulin deficiency may also be present.  Metformin reduces hepatic production of glucose, decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing both peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. In contrast with drugs of the sulfonylurea class, which lead to hyperinsulinemia, the secretion of insulin is unchanged with metformin use.  **Effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)**  HbA1c is an important periodic measure of glycemic control used to monitor diabetic patients. Fasting plasma glucose is also a useful and important measure of glycemic control. In a 29-week clinical trial of subjects diagnosed with type II diabetes, metformin decreased the fasting plasma glucose levels by an average of 59 mg/dL from baseline, compared to an average increase of 6.3 mg/dL from baseline in subjects taking a placebo.  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was decreased by about 1.4% in subjects receiving metformin, and increased by 0.4% in subjects receiving placebo only.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Single-dose clinical studies using oral doses of metformin 500 to 1500 mg and 850 to 2550 mg show that there is a lack of dose proportionality with an increase in metformin dose, attributed to decreased absorption rather than changes in elimination.  At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are achieved within 24-48 hours and are normally measured at <1 \u03bcg/mL.  **Extended-release tablet absorption**  After a single oral dose of metformin extended-release, Cmax is reached with a median value of 7 hours and a range of between 4 and 8 hours. Peak plasma levels are measured to be about 20% lower compared to the same dose of regular metformin, however, the extent of absorption of both forms (as measured by area under the curve - AUC), are similar.  **Effect of food**  Food reduces the absorption of metformin, as demonstrated by about a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute increase in time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) after ingestion of an 850 mg tablet of metformin taken with food, compared to the same dose administered during fasting.  Though the extent of metformin absorption (measured by the area under the curve - AUC) from the metformin extended-release tablet is increased by about 50% when given with food, no effect of food on Cmax and Tmax of metformin is observed. High and low-fat meals exert similar effects on the pharmacokinetics of extended-release metformin.",

The absolute oral bioavailability of the drug under fasting conditions is reported to be approximately 50-60% with metformin hydrochloride doses of 0.5-1.5 g; binding of the drug to the intestinal wall may explain the difference between the amount of drug absorbed (as determined by the urinary and fecal excretion of unchanged drug) and the amount bioavailable in some studies. In single-dose studies with metformin hydrochloride conventional tablets doses of 0.5-1.5 g or 0.85-2.55 g, plasma metformin concentrations did not increase in proportion to increasing doses, suggesting an active saturable absorption process. Similarly, in single-dose studies with an extended-release tablet preparation (Glumetza) at doses of 0.5-2.5 g, plasma metformin concentrations did not increase in proportion to increasing doses. At steady state after administration of a metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet preparation (Glucophage XR), the AUC and peak plasma concentrations were not dose proportional within the range of 0.5-2 g. However, limited data from studies in animals and in human intestinal cell cultures suggest that transepithelial transfer of metformin in the intestine may occur through a passive, nonsaturable mechanism, possibly involving a paracellular route. In several studies with another metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet preparation (Fortamet) using doses of 1-2.5 g, metformin exposure was dose-related.",

Following multiple-dose administration of metformin hydrochloride (500 mg twice daily for 7-14 days) as conventional tablets in a limited number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, peak plasma concentrations remained unchanged, but trough drug concentrations were higher than with single-dose administration, suggesting some drug accumulation in a peripheral tissue compartment. No accumulation of metformin appears to occur following repeated oral doses of the drug as extended-release tablets. The principal plasma elimination half-life of metformin averages approximately 6.2 hours; 90% of the drug is cleared within 24 hours in patients with normal renal function. The decline in plasma metformin concentrations is slower after oral than after IV administration of the drug, indicating that elimination is absorption rate-limited. Urinary excretion data and data from whole blood indicate a slower terminal-elimination phase half-life of 8-20 hours (e.g., 17.6 hours)1 suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.",

The highest tissue concentrations of metformin (at least 10 times the plasma concentration) occur in the GI tract (e.g., esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum), with lower concentrations (twice the plasma concentration) occurring in kidney, liver, and salivary gland tissue. The drug distributes into salivary glands with a half-life of about 9 hours. Metformin concentrations in saliva are tenfold lower than those in plasma and may be responsible for the metallic taste reported in some patients receiving the drug. Any local effect of metformin on glucose absorption in the GI tract may be associated with the relatively high GI concentrations of the drug compared with those in other tissues. It is not known whether metformin crosses the blood-brain barrier or the placenta in humans or if the drug is distributed into human milk; however, in lactating rats, metformin is distributed into breast milk at levels comparable to those in plasma.",

Renal impairment results in increased peak plasma concentrations of metformin, a prolonged time to peak plasma concentration, and a decreased volume of distribution. Renal clearance is decreased in patients with renal impairment (as measured by decreases in creatinine clearance) and, apparently because of reduced renal function with age, in geriatric individuals. In geriatric individuals, decreased renal and plasma clearance of metformin also results in increased plasma concentrations of the drug; volume of distribution remains unaffected.",

Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism.   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.  After ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios. These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators.  Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit _fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase_ enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting _adenylate cyclase_ and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin.   In the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose.   In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years.",

However, metformin treatment may induce intrahepatic cholestasis and liver injury in a few patients with type II diabetes through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that metformin decreases SIRT1 protein levels in primary hepatocytes and liver. Both metformin-treated wild-type C57 mice and hepatic SIRT1-mutant mice had increased hepatic and serum bile acid levels. However, metformin failed to change systemic bile acid levels in hepatic SIRT1-mutant mice. Molecular mechanism study indicates that SIRT1 directly interacts with and deacetylates Foxa2 to inhibit its transcriptional activity on expression of genes involved in bile acids synthesis and transport. Hepatic SIRT1 mutation elevates Foxa2 acetylation levels, which promotes Foxa2 binding to and activating genes involved in bile acids metabolism, impairing hepatic and systemic bile acid homeostasis. Our data clearly suggest that hepatic SIRT1 mediates metformin effects on systemic bile acid metabolism and modulation of SIRT1 activity in liver may be an attractive approach for treatment of bile acid-related diseases such as cholestasis.",

This leads to a shift in the balance of differentiation away from bone formation (osteogenesis) in favour of fat cell development (adipogenesis). The commonly used anti-diabetic drug, metformin, activates the osteogenic transcription factor Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), which may suppress adipogenesis, leading to improved bone health. Here we investigate the involvement of the metabolic enzyme, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in these protective actions of metformin. The anti-adipogenic actions of metformin were observed in multipotent C3H10T1/2 MSCs, in which metformin exerted reciprocal control over the activities of Runx2 and the adipogenic transcription factor, PPARgamma, leading to suppression of adipogenesis. These effects appeared to be independent of AMPK activation but rather through the suppression of the mTOR/p70S6K signalling pathway. Basal AMPK and mTOR/p70S6K activity did appear to be required for adipogenesis, as demonstrated by the use of the AMPK inhibitor, compound C. This observation was further supported by using AMPK knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) where adipogenesis, as assessed by reduced lipid accumulation and expression of the adipogeneic transcription factor, C/EBPbeta, was found to display an absolute requirement for AMPK. Further activation of AMPK in wild type MEFS, with either metformin or the AMPK-specific activator, A769662, was also associated with suppression of adipogenesis. It appears, therefore, that basal AMPK activity is required for adipogenesis and that metformin can inhibit adipogenesis through AMPK-dependent or -independent mechanisms, depending on the cellular context.",

It does not cause insulin release from the pancreas and does not cause hypoglycemia, even in large doses. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Metformin is believed to work by inhibiting hepatic glucose production and increasing the sensitivity of peripheral tissue to insulin. It does not stimulate insulin secretion, which explains the absence of hypoglycemia. Metformin also has beneficial effects on the plasma lipid concentrations and promotes weight loss. Accumulation of metformin may occur in patients with renal impairment, and such accumulation rarely can result in lactic acidosis, a serious, potentially fatal metabolic disease. Lactic acidosis constitutes a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization and treatment; lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations, decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. Lactic acidosis also may occur in association with a variety of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever substantial tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia exist. Approximately 50% of cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have been reported to be fatal. No evidence of mutagenicity or chromosomal damage was observed in in vitro test systems, including human lymphocytes assay. ANIMAL STUDIES: No evidence of carcinogenic potential was seen in a 104-week study in male and female rats receiving metformin hydrochloride dosages up to and including 900 mg/kg daily or in a 91-week study in male and female mice receiving metformin hydrochloride at dosages up to and including 1500 mg/kg daily. Cancer preventive effect of metformin (MF) has been studied in mice, rats and hamsters. In the majority of cases metformin treatment leads to inhibition of carcinogenesis. No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in rats following administration of metformin hydrochloride dosages of 600 mg/kg daily. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits given metformin hydrochloride dosages of 600 mg/kg daily  have not revealed teratogenicity. No evidence of mutagenicity or chromosomal damage was observed in vivo in a micronucleus test in mice or in in vitro test systems, including microbial (Ames test) and mammalian (mouse lymphoma) assays. Pretreatment of rat cerebellar granule neurons with metformin greatly enhanced cell viability against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. In aged male mice fed high-fat diet supplemented with metformin for 6 months, metformin decreased body fat composition and attenuated declines in motor function induced by a high fat diet. Performance in the Morris water maze test of hippocampal based memory function, showed that metformin prevented impairment of spatial reference memory associated with the high fat diet. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Adult fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were chronically exposed to metformin for 4 wk, at 40 ug/L. Metformin treatment induced significant up-regulation of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding the egg-protein vitellogenin in male fish, an indication of endocrine disruption.",

Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production, decreasing intestinal absorption of glucose, and improving insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. These effects are mediated by the initial activation by metformin of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a liver enzyme that plays an important role in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance, and the metabolism of glucose and fats. Activation of AMPK is required for metformin's inhibitory effect on the production of glucose by liver cells. Increased peripheral utilization of glucose may be due to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. Metformin administration also increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. The rare side effect, lactic acidosis, is thought to be caused by decreased liver uptake of serum lactate, one of the substrates of gluconeogenesis. In those with healthy renal function, the slight excess is simply cleared. However, those with severe renal impairment may accumulate clinically significant serum lactic acid levels. Other conditions that may precipitate lactic acidosis include severe hepatic disease and acute/decompensated heart failure.\n",

Indeed, metformin may actually lower elevated aminotransferase levels in patients with fatty liver disease. Clinically apparent liver injury from metformin is very rare, fewer than a dozen cases having been described in the literature despite widespread use of this agent for several decades. The liver injury usually appears after 1 to 8 weeks, typically with symptoms of weakness and fatigue followed by jaundice. Various combinations of hepatocellular and cholestatic injury have been described, and many have been mixed. Allergic manifestations are not typical but rash, fever and eosinophilia have been described. Autoantibody formation is also not typical. Because this agent is usually given in combination with other hypoglycemic agents, many of which also cause liver injury, it can be difficult to establish whether the injury is due to metformin or another agent. The timing of injury is perhaps most characteristic, the injury arising soon after the agent is started and not during long term therapy. Recovery is usually rapid after metformin is stopped.",

Although the dose in milk is low, metformin is sometimes detectable in low levels in the serum of breastfed infants. One sizeable prospective study found no adverse effects in breastfed infants. Metformin is sometimes used as a galactogogue in women with reduced milk supply, but there is no evidence that it is effective. Metformin should be used with caution while nursing newborn and premature infants and those with renal impairment.",

However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.High blood sugar levels before and during pregnancy increase the chance of birth defects and other complications.

Metformin is a drug with antihyperglycemic effects, and it has been shown to have a cardioprotective effect on left ventricular function in experimental animal models of myocardial ischemia. The present study investigated the cardioprotective effect of metformin in rats with doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Wistar albino rats were used in the study. Forty male, 10-week-old Wistar albino rats were randomly divided four groups. The control group rats were intraperitoneally administered saline solution twice a week, four doses in total. The doxorubicin group rats received doxorubicin (4 mg/kg, twice a week, cumulative dose: 16 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. The metformin group rats received metformin (250 mg/kg/day, every day for 14 days) via gavage. The doxorubicin + metformin group rats received doxorubicin and metformin at the same dose. Left ventricular functions were evaluated by using M-mode echocardiography one day after the last dose of doxorubicin. Heart tissue samples were histopathologically examined. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected using in situ terminal deoxynucleotide transferase assay (TUNEL). Serum brain natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide levels were measured. Catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were analyzed in the heart tissue. The assumptions of equality of variances and normal distribution were checked for all variables (Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Q graphics). To identify intergroup differences, one-way variant analysis or the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. A p<0.05 value was accepted as statistically significant. Our results showed that doxorubicin treatment caused significant deterioration in left ventricular functions by echocardiography, histological heart tissue damage, and increase in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Doxorubicin + metformin group showed protection in left ventricular function, elimination of histopathologic change, and reduced of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The present study provided evidence that metformin has cardioprotective effects against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.",

Studies also revealed that metformin induced apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. We investigated the combinatory effect of 5-ASA and metformin on HCT-116 and Caco-2 CRC cell lines. Apoptotic markers were determined using western blotting. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was determined by RT-PCR. Inflammatory transcription factors and metastatic markers were measured by ELISA. Metformin enhanced CRC cell death induced by 5-ASA through significant increase in oxidative stress and activation of apoptotic machinery. Moreover, metformin enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of 5-ASA by decreasing the gene expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, COX-2 and TNF-alpha and its receptors; TNF-R1 and TNF-R2. Significant inhibition of activation of NF-kappaB and STAT3 transcription factors, and their downstream targets was also observed. Metformin also enhanced the inhibitory effect of 5-ASA on MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzyme activity, indicating a decrease in metastasis. The current data demonstrate that metformin potentiates the antitumor effect of 5-ASA on CRC cells suggesting their potential use as an adjuvant treatment in CRC.",

However, in this paper we provide the first demonstration that metformin synergistically augments cisplatin cytotoxicity in the esophageal squamous cancer cell line, ECA109, under glucose-deprivation conditions, which may be more representative of the microenvironment within solid tumors; this effect is very different from the previously reported cytoprotective effect of metformin against cisplatin in commonly used high glucose incubation medium. The potential mechanisms underlying the synergistic effect of metformin on cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity under glucose-deprivation conditions may include enhancement of metformin-associated cytotoxicity, marked reduction in the cellular ATP levels, deregulation of the AKT and AMPK signaling pathways, and impaired DNA repair function.",

The gastrointestinal uptake of metformin is mediated by the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 4 (ENT4), which is inhibited by dipyridamole in preclinical studies. We hypothesized that dipyridamole lowers the plasma exposure to metformin. Eighteen healthy volunteers (mean age 23 years; 9 male) were randomized in an open-label crossover study. Subjects were allocated to treatment with metformin 500 mg twice daily in combination with dipyridamole slow-release 200 mg twice daily or to metformin alone for 4 days. After a washout period of 10 days, the volunteers were crossed over to the alternative treatment arm. Blood samples were collected during a 10-hr period after intake of the last metformin dose. The primary endpoint was the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-12hr) and the maximum plasma metformin concentration (C max). In healthy subjects, dipyridamole did not significantly affect Cmax nor AUC0-12hr of metformin under steady-state conditions. Previous in vitro studies report that dipyridamole inhibits the ENT4 transporter that mediates gastrointestinal uptake of metformin. In contrast, co-administration of dipyridamole at therapeutic dosages to healthy volunteers does not have a clinically relevant effect on metformin plasma steady-state exposure.",

Our objective was to investigate  this link by studying and analyzing published reports of so-called 'metformin-associated  lactic acidosis'. Systematically searched in the BIOSIS, DERWENT,  EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PASCAL databases of the English language and non-English language  literature for all reports of so-called 'metformin-associated lactic acidosis' published from  May 1995 through January 2000. Reports related to metformin overdose or  contrast media-induced renal failure /were not included/. Metformin accumulation and concurrent pathologies were  critically reviewed as precipitating factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis.  Metformin accumulation was assessed in terms of the recorded measurement of metformin  concentration in plasma or, if not available, by the presence of primary renal failure, i.e.  renal failure that was not secondary to a shock syndrome. We found 21 reports  describing a total of 26 patients. Criteria of lactic acidosis (lactate > 5 mmol/L, pH <or=  7.35) were not met in four patients. In the remaining 22 patients, plasma metformin  concentration was determined in only four, of whom one had a normal value. In the 18 patients  with lactic acidosis where plasma metformin concentration data was not available, the presence  of primary renal failure was absent or unlikely in six patients, uncertain in two, and likely  or proven in 14. With regard to these 14 patients, the precipitating factor was metformin in  12 patients (in the context of renal failure either chronic or acute) and intercurrent  pathologies in two others. Overall, lactic acidosis was either absent (n = 4), precipitated by  concurrent pathology (n = 8), precipitated by metformin without apparent associated pathology  (n = 12) or of uncertain origin (n = 2). Death occurred 10 times but only once in the 12  patients with metformin-induced lactic acidosis and this was not related to metformin.  While the term 'metformin-associated lactic acidosis' is commonly used to depict  all situations of lactic acidosis in metformin therapy, true metformin-associated lactic  acidosis, i.e. one which refers to metformin and concurrent pathologies as co-precipitating  factors, was never observed in the studied reports ...  /Salt not specified/",

The risk of developing lactic acidosis is much lower (e.g., 10-fold lower) with metformin than with phenformin (no longer commercially available in the US). However, lactic acidosis constitutes a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization and treatment; in such cases, metformin should be discontinued and general supportive therapy (e.g., volume expansion, diuresis) should be initiated immediately. Prompt hemodialysis also is recommended. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (exceeding 45 mg/dL), decreased blood pH (less than 7.35), electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. Lactic acidosis also may occur in association with a variety of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever substantial tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia exist. Approximately 50% of cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have been reported to be fatal. However, it has been suggested that in such cases of lactic acidosis not accompanied by conditions predisposing to tissue anoxia (e.g., heart failure, renal or pulmonary disease), techniques for the elimination of metformin from the body may allow recovery rates exceeding 80%.",

We report herein a case of suicide attempt with metformin presenting as MALA and acute renal failure on admission to emergency department and acute myocardial injury later on hospitalizaation. An obvious improvement of metabolic parameters was seen in our patient provided by anti-ischemic treatment together with bicarbonate infusion and hemodialysis. Although myocardial injury due to MALA is not a common disorder, we must be aware that metformin overdose with lack of tissue oxygenation, hypoperfusion, and arrhythmias may cause myocardial ischaemia.",

Here we studied 6 healthy, sedated and mechanically ventilated pigs to clarify whether high dose of metformin also increases skeletal muscle lactate production. Each animal had two microdialysis catheters inserted in gluteus muscles, one per side. One catheter was infused with saline (control) while the other one was infused with metformin diluted in saline (1M), both at a rate of 0.3 uL/min. Dialysate lactate concentration and lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, a marker of the balance between anaerobic glycolysis and aerobic (mitochondrial) metabolism, were measured every 3 hr, for 12 hr. Continuous infusion of metformin caused a progressive rise in dialysate lactate level (p=0.007) and lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (p<0.001) compared to that of saline, as for mitochondrial \"poisoning\". These findings suggest that skeletal muscle lactate overproduction contributes to the development of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.",

Metformin, a commonly used anti-diabetic drug, has been shown to have many beneficial effects outside of its therapeutic regulation of glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Studies on metformin's effects on the central nervous system are limited and predominantly consist of in vitro studies and a few in vivo studies with short-term treatment in relatively young animals; some provide support for metformin as a neuroprotective agent while others show evidence that metformin may be deleterious to neuronal survival. In this study, we examined the effect of long-term metformin treatment on brain neurotrophins and cognition in aged male C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were fed control (C), high-fat (HF) or a high-fat diet supplemented with metformin (HFM) for 6 months. Metformin decreased body fat composition and attenuated declines in motor function induced by a HF diet. Performance in the Morris water maze test of hippocampal based memory function, showed that metformin prevented impairment of spatial reference memory associated with the HF diet. Quantitative RT-PCR on brain homogenates revealed decreased transcription of BDNF, NGF and NTF3; however protein levels were not altered. Metformin treatment also decreased expression of the antioxidant pathway regulator, Nrf2. The decrease in transcription of neurotrophic factors and Nrf2 with chronic metformin intake, cautions of the possibility that extended metformin use may alter brain biochemistry in a manner that creates a vulnerable brain environment and warrants further investigation.",

Metformin crosses the placenta and has been associated with decreased inflammation and reversal of fatty liver in obese leptin-deficient mice. We investigated the effects of metformin on maternal and fetal lipid metabolism and hepatic inflammation using a rat model of diet-induced obesity during pregnancy. Female Wistar rats (6-7 weeks old) were fed normal or high calorie diets for 5 weeks. After mating with normal-diet fed males, half of the high calorie-fed dams received metformin (300 mg/kg, daily); dams (8 per group) continued diets through gestational day 19. Maternal and fetal livers and fetal brains were analyzed for fatty acids and for fatty acid metabolism-related gene expression. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc testing. When compared to control-lean maternal livers, obesogenic-diet-exposed maternal livers showed significantly higher saturated fatty acids (14:0 and 16:0) and monounsaturated fatty acids (16:1n7 and 18:1n9) and lower polyunsaturated (18:2n6 and 20:4n6 [arachidonic acid]) and anti-inflammatory n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (18:3n3 and 22:6n3 [docosahexaenoic acid]) (p<0.05). Metformin did not affect diet-induced changes in maternal livers. Fetal livers exposed to the high calorie diet showed significantly increased saturated fatty acids (18:0) and monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1n9 and 18:1n7) and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids (18:2n6, 20:4n6 and 22:6n3) and anti-inflammatory n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, along with increased gene expression of fatty acid metabolism markers (Fasn, D5d, D6d, Scd1, Lxra). Metformin significantly attenuated diet-induced inflammation and 18:1n9 and 22:6n3 in fetal livers, as well as n3 fatty acids (p<0.05). Prenatal obesogenic diet exposure significantly increased fetal liver IFNgamma levels (p<0.05), which was reversed by maternal metformin treatment (p<0.05). Consumption of a high calorie diet significantly affected maternal and fetal fatty acid metabolism. It reduced anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acids in maternal and fetal livers, altered gene expression of fatty acid metabolism markers, and induced inflammation in the fetal livers. Prenatal metformin attenuated some diet-induced fatty acid changes and inflammation in the fetal livers without affecting maternal livers, suggesting that maternal metformin may impact fetal/neonatal fatty acid/lipid metabolism.",

Because aging is associated with reduced renal function, metformin should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function. Generally, elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of metformin.",

Genetic endpoints related to metabolism and endocrine function as well as reproduction-related endpoints were examined. Metformin treatment induced significant up-regulation of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding the egg-protein vitellogenin in male fish, an indication of endocrine disruption.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.6X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates metformin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase metformin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours. Particulate-phase metformin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Metformin does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, metformin is expected to have very high mobility based upon Koc values of 19, 16 and 12. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.6X10-16 atm-cu m/mole. Metformin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Half-lives of 1-5 days when incubated in soil under aerobic conditions suggest that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate procss in soil. If released into water, metformin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Biodegradation data in water were not available. However, dissipation of 1.3 and 8.2% for metformin hydrochloride in aerobic aquatic systems suggest that biodegradation may be a slow environmental fate process in water. The majority of radioactivity applied (81.5%) was found in the sediment. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to metformin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where metformin is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to metformin via ingestion of contaminated water, and medical administration of metformin. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The concentrations of metformin in breast milk are generally low and the mean infant exposure to metformin has been reported in the range 0.28-1.08% of the weight-normalized maternal dose, well below the level of concern for breastfeeding. No adverse effects on blood glucose of nursing infants have been reported. Metformin during lactation versus formula feeding appears to have no adverse effects on infants' growth, motor-social development and intercurrent illness during the first 6 months of life. Systematic studies have not yet been done assessing how hyperinsulinemia, polycystic ovary syndrome and metformin may affect lactation.",

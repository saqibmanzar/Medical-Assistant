Urethane can be produced by the reaction of ammonia with ethyl chloroformate or by heating urea nitrate and ethyl alcohol. It was first prepared in the mid 1800\u2019s. Ethyl carbamate was used as an antineoplastic agent in the treatment of multiple myeloma before it was found in 1943 to be toxic, carcinogenic and largely ineffective. Japanese usage in medical injections continued and from 1950 to 1975. Ethyl carbamate has now been withdrawn from pharmaceutical use. However, small quantities of ethyl carbamate are also used in laboratories as an anesthetic for animals. Studies have shown that most, if not all, yeast-fermented alcoholic beverages contain traces of ethyl carbamate (15 ppb to 12 ppm). Other foods and beverages prepared by means of fermentation also contain ethyl carbamate. For example, bread has been found to contain 2 ppb while as much as 20 ppb has been found in some samples of soy sauce.  \u201cNatural\u201d ethyl carbamate is formed during distillation from natural precursors such as cyanide, urea, citrulline and other N-carbamoyl compounds.\n",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The pivotal study for risk assessment was a recent drinking water bioassay in mice. The increased incidences of alveolar and bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma in mice was considered to be the critical effect in the study. Benchmark dose modeling produced BMDL10 values that ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg bw/d. The margins of exposure between the lower bound of the BMDL10 range of 0.3 mg/kg bw/d and the mean and high intake values for ethyl carbamate in the diet were 20 000 and 3800, respectively. The Committee concluded that intake of ethyl carbamate from foods excluding alcoholic beverages would be of low concern. The margin of exposure for all intakes, food and alcoholic beverages combined, was of concern and therefore mitigation measures to reduce concentrations of ethyl carbamate in some alcoholic beverages should be continued.",

One hour after treatment, the mice were frozen and processed for whole body autoradiography. When urethane was administered in water, the radioactivity localized in the salivary, seromucous, and Harderian glands, medullary bone, liver, bile, and epithelia of the stomach and intestine. Lower levels were seen in brown fat, and in the thymus and esophagus. When urethane was administered in ethanol, localization of urethane at each of these sites was almost completely inhibited; high concentrations were still found in the lumen of the stomach and intestine. No evidence was found of transesterification at pH 1.5 in 12% ethanol.",

Distribution in skin, stomach, liver, and lung was determined for time periods up to 48 hr. The binding of these compounds to DNA, RNA, and protein in these tissues was determined 6 and 48 hr after administration. For all three compounds, high concentrations were found in the skin following topical application, but very little material reached this target organ following oral administration. The internal organs generally contained more material after oral administration compared to topical application, whereas the opposite was true for the skin. Differences in distribution to the skin and binding to macromolecules following oral or topical administration cannot explain the greater tumorigenicity of urethane and acrylamide after oral administration in the Sencar mouse.",

It is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and the skin. Metabolism is mediated by cytochrome P450 2E1.  Metabolites of ethyl carbamate include N-hydroxyethylcarbamate, alpha-hydroxyethylcarbamate and vinyl carbamate.  After conjugation, N-hydroxyethylcarbamate is excreted in the urine, alpha-hydroxyethyl carbamate is metabolized to ammonia and CO2 and vinyl carbamate is converted to vinyl carbamate epoxide.  The vinyl carbamate epoxide is thought to be the metabolite that is responsible for the carcinogenic properties of ethyl carbamate based on its ability to form etheno-DNA adducts (A15086)",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

A single band, either PGK-la or PGK-lb occurred in two out of 7 tumors; and 5 remaining tumors showed either band la and lb associated with a trace band of the other isozyme. Though traces of stromal element and/or blood cells seem to be mixed among the neoplastic tissue, the pulmonary tumor could have originated from a single cell, when one takes into account the significantly higher expression in one band.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

After initiation with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (stage 1) and limited promotion by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (stage II), papilloma bearing mice were treated (stage III) with either tumor initiators, such as urethane, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide; the promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, or solvent (acetone). Treatment with tumor initiators in stage III increased both the rate of appearance and the final yield of carcinomas. Similar results were obtained in both Sencar and CD-1 mice. A papilloma stage appears to be necessary for carcinoma development since elimination of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment in stage II greatly reduced the incidence of both papillomas and carcinomas in both stocks of mice. The carcinomas that develop using the three stage regimen vary in metastatic potential. In CD-1 mice, the frequency of metastases to lymph nodes were similar in groups treated in stage III with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, urethane, 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-guanidine or acetone, but treatment with urethane substantially increased metastases to the lung.",

In doses of 90-1800 mg/kg given ip in mixed lipid vehicle over nine weeks, the compound decreased to 60% of controls the number of lung tumors which was induced in A/J mice by 20 mg of ethyl carbamate. The highest dose also decreased the mean volume of lung tumors to 505 of controls, resulting in a total tumor volume of 30% of controls. Retinoic acid itself of 450 mg/kg was toxic, and no chemopreventive activity was observed. The free base and the lipophilic perchlorate salt of homocysteine thiolactone both increased the number of lung tumors to 114-117% of controls, indicating a co-carcinogenic effect. In C57BL/6N mice with transplanted MUO4 rhabdomyosarcoma, N-homocysteine thiolactonyl retinamide in a dose of 1000 mg/kg given over 11-21 days decreased the weight of the tumors to 30-70% of controls. Therefore, N-homocysteine thiolactonyl retinamide has chemopreventive activity against chemical carcinogenesis and antineoplastic activity against a transplanted neoplasm.",

Both established and suspected carcinogens had been handled in the plant, primarily piperazine, but also urethane, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, and organic solvents. A significantly increased mortality, compared with the regional death rate, was observed in the cohort. The increase was mainly due to violent deaths and cardiovascular diseases. No rise in death rates was observed for asthma, bronchitis or emphysema, in spite of other evidence of a high risk of occupational asthma, due to exposure to piperazine. A statistically significant increase in cancer morbidity was observed for malignant lymphoma/myelomatosis when an induction latency time of at least 10 years was used. Furthermore, an increase in bronchial cancer was noted, but it was statistically significant only when an induction latency time of at least 15 years was used.",

Urethane (1 g/kg and higher) significantly increase hepatic metallothionein levels, resulting in a 14-fold increase after 2 g/kg. Time course experiments indicated that metallothionein levels were increased significantly at 6 hr after administration of urethane (1.5 g/kg) and reached a maximum between 12 and 24 hr. Gel filtration, anion exchange chromatography, and UV spectral analysis were used to characterize the protein induced by urethane. Pretreatment with actinomycin-D prevented induction of metallothionein by urethane. Administration of equimolar dosages (20 mmol/kg) of urethane, N-hydroxyurethane, and methyl carbamate indicated that urethane and N-hydroxyurethane induce metallothionein but that methyl carbamate does not. Metallothionein induction was also not observed with (pentobarbital and phenobarbital).

To investigate the role of esterase in ethyl carbamate-induced immunosuppression, mice were pretreated intraperitoneally with an esterase inhibitor, diazinon, at 20 mg/kg 30 min prior to the administration of ethyl carbamate intraperitoneally at 100 and 400 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days. Pretreatment with diazinon completely blocked the serum esterase activity. Histopathologically splenic and thymic atrophy was observed when mice were treated with ethyl carbamate, which was potentiated by the pretreatment with diazinon. In spleen, lymphocytes in the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath and the marginal zone appeared to be depleted in the white pulps. In thymus, ethyl carbamate caused a marked depletion of cells in cortex. The antibody response to sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) was more suppressed by ethyl carbamate in diazinon-pretreated groups than in corn oil-pretreated groups.",

Concentrations of 10, 30, and 90 ppm urethane resulted in average daily consumption of approximately 40, 115, and 360 ug urethane for males and 35, 105, and 325 ug for females. ...Urethane caused an exposure-related decrease in survival of mice. ...  Under the conditions of this 2-year drinking water study, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of urethane in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of liver, lung, harderian gland, skin, and forestomach neoplasms and of hemangiosarcoma, primarily of the liver and heart. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of urethane in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of liver, lung, harderian gland, mammary gland, and ovarian neoplasms and of hemangiosarcoma, primarily of the liver and spleen. The occurrences of hemangiosarcoma of the spleen in males and of the uterus and skin in females may have been exposure related. Exposure to urethane resulted in increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the liver and heart in males and females and of the uterus in females. /Although additional groups of mice were exposed ro urethane and ethanol/ The design of this 2-year drinking water study was inadequate to determine the carcinogenic activity of ethanol in male and female B6C3F 1 mice. Overall, there was weak evidence of an interaction of ethanol in the carcinogenicity of urethane in B6C3F1 mice. In males, increasing the ethanol concentration may have decreased the alveolar/bronchiolar and harderian gland adenoma or carcinoma responses to urethane. In females, increasing the ethanol concentration may have increased the incidence of hemangiosarcoma of the heart and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma responses to urethane.",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 0.262 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl carbamate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl carbamate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours. Ethyl carbamate does not contain chromophores that absorb light at wavelengths >290 and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis from sunlight. If released to soil, ethyl carbamate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 20. Volatilization from water or moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyl carbamate will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The rate of biodegradation in soil is dependent upon the initial concentration of ethyl carbamate. At low levels, ethyl carbamate may degrade rapidly, but at higher levels, it is toxic to the microbes and hence proceeds slowly. If released to water, ethyl carbamate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Ethyl carbamate was classified as easy to biodegrade in river die-away tests. Other biodegradation studies using activated sludge indicate ethyl carbamate may biodegrade slowly. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process since carbamates tend to hydrolyze slowly under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to ethyl carbamate may occur through inhalation of dust particles and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl carbamate is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to ethyl carbamate via ingestion of fermented foods and alcoholic beverages. (SRC)",

Volatilization of ethyl carbamate from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its extrapolated vapor pressure, 0.262 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 4.8X10+5 mg/L(5). Ethyl carbamate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon the extrapolated vapor pressure(4). Ethyl carbamate is converted to nitrate in fresh soils after a lengthy lag period(6). The initial step in this process is the hydrolysis of the ethyl carbamate to ethanol, ammonia, and CO2 by soil microorganisms(6).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.262 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 4.8X10+5 mg/L(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 2.6X10-4 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(8); this corresponds to half-lives of 3,300 and 330 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(8). Ethyl carbamate was classified as easy to biodegrade using river die-away tests(9). However at high concentrations biodegradation proceeds slowly using activated sludge inocula since ethyl carbamate may be toxic to the microbes at high levels and require an adaptation period(10,11).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Edaravone works to scavenge reactive oxygen species, which have been implicated in neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cerebral ischemia.  The intravenous formulation of edaravone was first approved in Japan in 2001 for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. It was later approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Japan and South Korea in 2015, followed by the FDA approval in May 2017 and Health Canada approval in October 2018. The oral suspension formulation of edaravone was approved by the FDA in May 2022 and by Health Canada in November 2022.  Edaravone was initially granted orphan designation by the European Medicines Agency on June 19, 2015 and was under regulatory review in Europe. However, the drug manufacturer, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, withdrew the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for edaravone from the European market on May 24, 2019, in response to the request made by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for a long-term study demonstrating the long-term efficacy and safety of edaravone. Edaravone was also investigated in other disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, neuropathic pain, and ischemia-induced nerve injury.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

The mean Cmax (CV%) and Tmax were 1656 (44.3) ng/mL and 0.5 hours, respectively, following oral administration. The absolute oral bioavailability is about 57% because of first-pass metabolism.  The mean Cmax (CV%) and Tmax were 1253 (18.3) ng/mL and one hour, respectively, following intravenous administration. When intravenously administered, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of edaravone was reached by the end of infusion.  The Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of edaravone increases more than dose-proportional over the dose range of 30 to 300 mg. Edaravone does not accumulate in plasma with once-daily or multiple-dose administration. The Cmax and AUC decreased when the oral suspension formulation of edaravone was administered with a high-fat meal.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Oxidative stress caused by excess ROS damages endothelial cells in the cerebral vasculature as well as neuronal cell membranes, leading to neuronal cell death.  Edaravone is a free radical scavenger that scavenges and suppresses the generation of hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite radicals. The exact mechanism of action of edaravone in ALS has not been fully elucidated; however, edaravone is thought to mediate therapeutic effects via its antioxidant properties. Since oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ALS and cerebral ischemia, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, suppressing endothelial cell damage induced by lipid peroxides, and scavenging free radicals may lead to neuroprotective effects. Edaravone has no effect on superoxide production. It is suggested that edaravone may also possess anti-inflammatory properties, as it inhibited neutrophil activation and suppressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression in animal models. It was also shown to ameliorate ROS-induced inflammatory oxidative stress after ischemic brain reperfusion.",

These references have been ranked automatically by an algorithm which calculates the relevance for each substance in a Springer Nature document. It is based on: (1) the TF-IDF, adapted to chemical structures, (2) location information in the text (e.g. title, abstract, keywords), and (3) the document size.  Springer Nature aims to provide only highly qualitative and relevant content but references of lower relevance aren't withheld as they might contain also very useful information.",

Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid and kill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment. (L795)",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. 4-Chloro-2-butynyl meta-chlorocarbanilate is found on List B.

The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): 4-Chloro-2-butynyl meta-chlorocarbanilate; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

Carbamates form unstable complexes with chlolinesterases by carbamoylation of the active sites of the enzymes.  This inhibition is reversible. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholine esterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholine esterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses.  Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Chronically high (>10 years) exposure leads to neuropsychological consequences including disturbances in perception and visuo-motor processing (A15321).",

Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.8X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates barban will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase barban will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 hrs. Particulate-phase barban will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Barban does not contain chromophores that would be expected to absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and would not be expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, barban is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,200. Barban was found to disappear more rapidly in non-autoclaved soil than in autoclaved soil and appeared to be stable in the presence of anaerobic microorganisms, however specific details were not available. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Barban is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, barban is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 160 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate process as indicated by estimated half-lives of 1.1 hours and 6.84 minutes at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since barban is no longer produced or used in the US (May, 2005). In the past, barban was applied directly to the barley and wheat crops as a herbicide and occupational exposure to this compound was primarily by inhalation of dust particles and dermal contact.

Volatilization of barban from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 3.8X10-7 mm Hg(4), and water solubility mg/L(2).  Barban is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). Barban was found to disappear more rapidly in non-autoclaved soil than in autoclaved soil(5) and appeared to be stable in the presence of anaerobic microorganisms(6); however, specific details were not available.",

It was demonstrated that barban was metabolized in both tolerant wheat and sensitive wild oat to 3-chloroaniline. In leaf-treated tissues, it was concluded that 14C-labeled barban concentration decreased with time and the 3-chloroaniline moiety of barban was complexed as polar metabolites. It was also determined that root-treated soybean plants absorb, translocate, and metabolize 14C-labeled barban. These studies indicated that the barban molecule was not cleaved in soybean(2).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that barban is expected to have slight mobility in soil. Using TLC and aluminum oxide sorbent, the Rf value of barban was determined to be 0.5(4). The phenylcarbamate herbicides are much more water soluble than the substituted anilines(5). In spite of this, however, they are very immobile in soil systems. These compounds have been shown to be activated by adsorption to soil organic matter. Compounds in this group include barban. The mechanism of adsorption to soil organic matter is thought to involve hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl groups of the organic matter and the nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen of the carbamate(5).",

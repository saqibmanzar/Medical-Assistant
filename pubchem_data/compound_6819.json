PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The reaction generally starts at elevated temperatures and proceeds exothermically. The second step is the conversion of the monoester to a diester with the formation of water. This is a reversible reaction and proceeds more slowly than the first, thus determining the overall rate of reaction. To shift the equilibrium towards the diester, the water of reaction is removed by distillation. The rate of reaction can be influenced by the choice of catalyst and the reaction temperature. For fast conversion rates, high reaction temperatures are generally used. However, these are influenced by the boiling point of the alcohol and/or the type of catalyst. ... Currently, nearly all major phthalate producers use amphoteric catalysts for the esterification of high boiling alcohols. ... The reaction temperatures for the amphoteric catalysts are about 200 \u00b0C. At this temperature side reactions are minimized, and the alcohol can be recycled without purification. By using this type of catalyst, over 99.5 % conversion to diester can be achieved. /Phthalates/",

An experimental facility was built in southeast Florida that provided both unchlorinated and chlorinated effluent from three standard treatments: primary settling, chemical flocculation, and activated sludge secondary treatment. Exposure tests lasting longer than one month were conducted on the sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) and the pink shrimp (Penaeus duorarum), with each of these six effluent types at seawater dilution ratios of 30:1, 100:1, and 300:1. The shrimp showed a much more sensitive response than the minnow. Almost 100% mortality occurred for shrimp exposed to the unchlorinated 30:1 seawater dilutions of primary-settled wastewater, while mortality for the other two effluents were similar to controls. Mortality could not be attributed to any of the chemicals measured in the wastewater. For the 30:1 dilution experiments, chlorination usually resulted in much higher toxicity; increasing the dilution factor from 30:1 to 100:1 reduced the mortality observed (in both unchlorinated and chlorinated tests) essentially to control levels. Little bioaccumulation of metals or chlorinated organics in exposed specimens."

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.1X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates butyl glycolyl butyl phthalate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase butyl glycolyl butyl phthalate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 40 hours. Particulate-phase butyl glycolyl butyl phthalate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Butyl glycolyl butyl phthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, butyl glycolyl butyl phthalate is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.5X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Rates of 84.5 to >99% biodegradation in 24 hrs using a semicontinuous activated sludge test suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, butyl glycolyl butyl phthalate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A 95% biodegradation in 2 days using a river die-away test suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 300 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. However, bioconcentration studies on compounds which are structurally similar suggest that bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 11 and 1 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to butyl glycolyl butyl phthalate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where butyl glycolyl butyl phthalate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed via dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 300(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 4.15(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). However, bioconcentration studies on compounds which are structurally similar suggest that bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated by the regression-derived equations due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds(8). Hydrolysis is expected to be an important process(SRC) based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 11 and 1 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively(9). A 95% biodegradation in 2 days using the river die-away test(10) suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Groups of 4 mice were sacrificed at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 hours after injection for measurement of radioactivity in fat, kidney, liver, and lung. Blood 2-methylnaphthalene concentrations decreased with a reported elimination half-life of 3 hours, indicative of rapid distribution to other tissues or elimination from the body. Peak tissue concentrations of 2-methylnaphthalene equivalents (nmol/mg wet weight) were attained about 1 hour after injection in the liver, 2 hours after injection in the fat, and 4 hours after injection in the kidney and the lung. Peak concentrations were highest in fat (13 nmol/mg), followed by lower concentrations in liver (3.5 nmol/mg), kidney (2.9 nmol/mg), and lung (0.7 nmol/mg). The results demonstrate that 2-methylnaphthalene did not preferentially accumulate in the lung although the lung was the only site of toxicity. Histological examination found that the single 400 mg/kg dose induced bronchiolar necrosis (minimal to prominent sloughing of lining cells in the bronchiolar lumen as revealed by light microscopy) in all exposed mice. No lesions were found in the liver or kidney of exposed mice at any time point. Consistent with the attainment of peak lung tissue concentration at 4 hours after injection, no lesions were evident until 8 hours after injection. The authors also evaluated distribution by measurement of irreversible binding of label from (14)C-2-methylnaphthalene to various tissues over a dose (0, 50, 100, 300, and 500 mg/kg; intraperitoneal injection) and time course (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hrs). Maximum irreversible binding of 2-methylnaphthalene metabolites was observed in lung, liver, and kidney tissues at 8 hours post administration. The binding was dose- dependent in all tissues between 50-500 mg/kg and concentrations of bound radioactivity were higher in the liver and kidney than in the lung (the only tissue where lesions were found).",

Renal microsomal NADPH-dependent metabolism of either substrate was not detected. The formation of covalently bound naphthalene or 2-methylnaphthalene metabolites was dependent upon NADPH and was inhibited by the addition of reduced glutathione, piperonyl butoxide, and SKF 525A. Covalent binding of radioactivity from (14)C2-methylnaphthalene also was strongly inhibited by incubation in a nitrogen atmosphere or at 2 degree. The arachidonic acid-dependent formation of reactive metabolites from naphthalene or 2-methylnaphthalene was undetectable in microsomal incubations from lung, liver or kidney. Indomethacin, 1 hr before and 6 hr after the administration of 300 mg/kg naphthalene or 2-methylnaphthalene, failed to block the pulmonary bronchiolar injury induced by these aromatic hydrocarbons. These studies suggest that the major enzymes involved in the metabolic activation of naphthalene or 2-methylnaphthalene in vitro are the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases and that cooxidative metabolism by the prostaglandin synthetases appears to play little role in the formation of reactive metabolites in vitro.",

The solvent was separated and extracted with hexane (C6H14), which was then dried and concentrated and added to a silicic acid column. The column was eluted with additional C6H14 to yield an alkane fraction and with 4% ether in hexane to yield a methyl-substituted fraction. The respective fractions were separated into their component hydrocarbons by gas chromatography. This procedure allowed recovery of > 70% of the alkanes and methylnaphthalenes added to tissue, and min detectable levels were 0.08-0.15 and 0.03-0.04 ug/g, respectively.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer saftey standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Methylated naphthalenes is found on List C. Case No: 3088; Pesticide type: insecticide, fungicide; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered. Therefore, we are characterizing the case as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): methylated naphthalenes; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered products ... cancelled.\" /Methylated naphthalenes/"

It is also used  as dye carrier. Pure 2-methylnaphthalene is used primarily as a raw material for the production of vitamin K preparations. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: In contrast to naphthalene, the only reported effects of methylated naphthalene in man are skin irritation and skin photosensitization. It is not a human carcinogen. Chromosome analyses were carried out in human lymphocytes treated in vitro with 2-methylnaphthalene in the presence and absence of the mammalian metabolic activation system. Without metabolic activation there was no indication of induction of any significant cytogenetic effect by either compound. With metabolic activation a weak clastogenic effect was apparent at 4 mM 2-methylnaphthalene  and sister-chromatid exchange frequencies were significantly increased at each dose of 2-methylnaphthale, yet always less than twice the control level. The present observations do not indicate that 2-methylnaphthalene must be classified as potential genotoxic substance. ANIMAL STUDIES: 2-Methylnaphthalene is an eye and skin irritant in rabbits. Single doses of 0 or 300 mg/kg 2-methylnaphthalene were administered to male mice by intraperitoneal injection, with sacrifice 24 hours later. Histological examinations identified bronchiolar necrosis in all treated animals, and no lesions among controls. 2-methylnaphthalene produced depression of the respiratory rate in rats under acute inhalation exposure. In mice treated by i.p. injection naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene were about equally toxic. In all cases the first evidence of cytotoxic effects was seen in the Clara cells of the bronchiolar epithelium, and, at the highest doses, toxic effects were found in the adjacent ciliated cells. Changes could be detected at the ultrastructural level at all doses, and within 6 hours after treatment. Only slight effects were seen in other cell types. Other studies demonstrated that a pulmonary toxic dose of 2-methylnaphtalene (400 mg/kg, i.p.) administered to mice significantly depleted reduced GSH in the liver and lung and to a lesser extent, in the kidney. Carcinogenicity studies in mice indicated that 2-methylnaphthalene induces pulmonary alveolar proteinosis but does not possess unequivocal carcinogenic potential in mice. 2-Methylnaphthalene was tested quantitatively using S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 with and without metabolic activation, the concentration used was 3 umol/plate. 2-Methylnaphthalene was not mutagenic. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: 2-Methylnaphthalene was toxic to Dungeness crab (C magister) larvae LC50 5 mg/L at 48 hr, LC50 1.3 mg/L at 96 hr.",

Many PAH's induce the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1, by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor or glycine N-methyltransferase protein. These enzymes metabolize PAH's into their toxic intermediates. The reactive metabolites of PAHs (epoxide intermediates, dihydrodiols, phenols, quinones, and their various combinations) covalently bind to DNA and other cellular macromolecules, initiating mutagenesis and carcinogenesis.

With S9 mix a weak clastogenic effect was apparent at 4 mM 2-MN only and sister-chromatid exchange frequencies were significantly increased at each dose of 1- and 2-MN, yet always less than twice the control level.

Each compound was dispersed in the atmosphere in a refined kerosene base using a fogger. Exposures occurred on four consecutive mornings. Based on the information presented, it was not possible to determine the exposure concentration. Pure 1-methylnaphthalene increased the reticulocyte counts in the splenectomized dogs but not the intact dogs. Reticulocyte values remained elevated for 10 days after the fogging ceased. Practical grade 1-methylnaphthalene increased leukocyte counts in intact and splenectomized dogs and neutrophil counts in intact dogs, but pure 1-methylnaphthalene had no effect on these parameters. 2-Methylnaphthalene had no effect on any of the parameters monitored. Neither 1-methylnaphthalene nor 2-methylnaphthalene had an effect on hematocrit values, suggesting that these compounds do not cause hemolysis under the conditions of the study. Since the increased reticulocyte counts were seen only in splenectomized dogs, it is difficult to interpret whether or not this change signifies increased hematopoiesis in response to 1-methylnaphthalene exposure.",

After intraarterial injection of one of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (10 mg/kg) to trout, chemical concentration in the blood was found to decline triphasically with time. The terminal half-lives of elimination from the blood for 2-MN, fluorene and pyrene were 9.6, 10.5 and 12.8 hr, respectively. The toxicokinetics of the PAHs in trout were best described by a three-compartment open model with the central compartment and the deep peripheral compartment representing the blood and fatty tissues of trout, respectively. The PAHs were metabolized by trout mainly to water-soluble metabolites which were excreted into the urine and bile. When trout were exposed to water containing 2-MN, fluorene or pyrene (0.5 mg/L), the chemical was detected almost immediately in the blood. The apparent bioavailabilities of 2-MN, fluorene and pyrene in trout were 20, 36 and 35%, respectively. In contrast, little or no unchanged chemical was detected in the blood of trout following intragastric administration of 2-MN, fluorene or pyrene (50 mg/kg). These results indicate that the PAHs are absorbed systemically by trout via the branchial route at rates much faster than that of the oral route.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.055 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-methylnaphthalene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-methylnaphthalene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrogen pentoxide; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 7.4 hours, >29 days and 9.6 days, respectively. 2-Methylnaphthalene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-methylnaphthalene is expected to have slight to no mobility based upon log Koc values of 3.00-5.96. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.18X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 2-Methylnaphthalene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 2-Methylnaphthalene was observed to biodegrade rapidly in soil acclimated to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and at a slower rate in unacclimated environments. A lag-period of two weeks was observed followed by rapid degradation to 17% residual in the two weeks following the lag period and was not detected after 25 weeks,  using microcosms filled with soil  material and a coal derived wood-preservative. If released into water, 2-methylnaphthalene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. 2-Methylnaphthalene was completely removed within <7-14 days from acclimated groundwater aquifer grab samples; unacclimated material from the aquifer degraded 2-methylnaphthalene at an average rate of 3.5% per week. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.5 hours and 5.3 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 41-78 days if adsorption is considered. Reported BCF values of 30-2921 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high, the compound may be metabolized by the organism decreasing the BCF. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). 2-Methylnaphthalene was completely removed within <7-14 days from acclimated groundwater aquifer grab samples. Unacclimated material from the aquifer degraded 2-methylnaphthalene at an average rate of 3.5% per week. Occupational exposure to 2-methylnaphthalene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-methylnaphthalene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-methylnaphthalene via inhalation of ambient air and cigarette smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with products containing 2-methylnaphthalene.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.18X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.5 hours and 5.3 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 41-78 days if adsorption is considered(6). 2-Methylnaphthalene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values of 30-2921 in Coho salmon(8), Starry flounder(8), sheepshead minnow(9) and bluegill sunfish(10), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high, the compound may be metabolized by the organism decreasing the BCF(SRC). The direct aqueous photolysis half-life for midday, midsummer sunlight at 40 deg N latitude was predicted to be 54 hours for 2-methylnaphthalene(11). 2-Methylnaphthalene was completely removed within <7-14 days from acclimated groundwater aquifer grab samples(12-13). Unacclimated material from the aquifer degraded 2-methylnaphthalene at an average rate of 3.5% per week(13).",

Vapor-phase 2-methylnaphthalene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.4 hour(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.23X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 2-methylnaphthalene with ozone has been reported as <4X10-19 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of >29 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(4). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 2-methylnaphthalene with nitrogen pentoxide has been measured to be 4.2X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C which corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 9.6 days at an atmospheric concentration of 2X10+10 nitrogen pentoxide molecules per cu cm(3). 2-Methylnaphthalene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

In anaerobic ground water from a former gasworks site, Dusseldorf-Flingern, Germany, 2-methylnaphthalene was found to biodegrade to naphthoic acid, methylnaphthoic acid, naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid and naphthyl-2-methylene-succinic acid(2).

The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 2-methylnaphthalene with ozone has been reported as <4X10-19 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of >29 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 2-methylnaphthalene with nitrogen pentoxide has been measured to be 4.2X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C which corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 9.6 days at an atmospheric concentration of 2X10+10 molecules per cu cm(1). 2-Methylnaphthalene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). 2-Methylnaphthalene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). The direct aqueous photolysis half-life for midday, midsummer sunlight at 40 deg N latitude was predicted to be 54 hours(6).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 5.5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 5.3 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 41-78 days when adsorption is considered(3). 2-Methylnaphthalene's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 2-Methylnaphthalene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.055 mm Hg(4).",

Water samples collected from 1987 to 1989 from the head and mouth of the St. Clair River, which runs between Ontario Canada and Michigan, had 2-methylnaphthalene concentrations of 0.32-4.02 ng/L at Point Edward (head) and 0.7-19.5 ng/L at Port Lambton (mouth) with respective means of 0.96 and 1.04 ng/L(5). 2-Methylnaphthalene was detected in water samples collected Jun and Aug 1988 from four stations along the Rainy River on the Ontario, Canada and Minnesota boarder at concentrations of 2.8-287.5 ng/L(6). 2-Methylnaphthalene was found in the Rainy River where final effluent from two bleached kraft mills discharge directly into the river at 8.8-1720.0 ng/L(6). Surface water collected in Mar 1990 from a stream adjacent to a creosote works facility in Florida contained 2-methylnaphthalene at 0.0068 mg/L(7). Concentrations of 2-methylnaphthalene in the northeast and northwest branches of the Anacostia River in Maryland were 0.4-63 ng/L in the dissolved phase and 0.1-21 ng/L in the particulate phase with means of 6.8 and 3.3 ng/L, respectively(8). 2-Methylnaphthalene concentrations in the San Joaquin River, CA and its tributaries in 1992 were <1.0-4.2 ng/L(9). 2-Methylnaphthalene was not detected in six cave rivers located in northeastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas, not detected in Little Osage Creek, AR, but was detected in an unnamed creek in Oklahoma at 48.3 ng/POCIS sample (polar organic chemical integrative sampler), samples were collected May to July 2006(10). 2-Methylnaphthalene was not detected (detection limit 0.5 ug/L) in 21 samples collected from rivers in Arkansas Mar, Apr and Aug 2004(11). 2-Methylnaphthalene was not detected in samples collected in 2001 from 23 stream locations upstream and downstream of 10 cities in Iowa at high flow or normal flow conditions, in 1 of 30 low flow samples from the same locations 2-methylnaphthalene was detected at 0.056 ug/L(12).",

Emissions factors for 19 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were measured during wind tunnel simulations of open burning for agricultural and forest biomass fuels; 2-methylnaphthalene average concentrations were 745, 10,970, 7307 and 16,960 ug/kg for wheat cereal, rice cereal, almond wood and pine wood, respectively(3). The 2-methylnaphthalene concentration in diesel powered medium duty truck emissions in the gas phase was 611 ug/km(4). Gas phase 2-methylnaphthalene emission rates from fireplace combustion of pine, oak and eucalyptus wood were 15.0, 9.61 and 5.69 mg/kg of wood burned, respectively(5). 2-Methylnaphthalene emission rates from combustion of craft lignin were 6-520 mg/kg depending on the starting mass and combustion temperature(6). Data from Aug 25 to Sept 7, 1979 showed for a speed of 80 km/hr on straight and level highway, gasoline powered vehicles and diesel trucks emitted 2-methylnaphthalene at an average rate of 3.4 and 0.2 mg/km, respectively(7). 2-Methylnaphthalene concentrations in the emissions collected in Jul and Aug 1995 from two passenger ferries operating in the Skagurak-Kattegatt-Oresund Regions between Sweden and Denmark, were 80 and 7.1 ug/cu nm(8). 2-Methylnaphthalene concentrations were found to range from 1.60 to 475 ng/filter in outboard marine engine particulate matter(9). The water concentration of 2-methylnaphthalene was shown to increase from 3 to 276 ng/L as a result of motorboat traffic in a canal of a fresh water lake(10). The emission rate of 2-methylnaphthalene emitted from the vehicle fleet in the Van Nuys Tunnel in Los Angeles on Sept 21, 1993 from 6 to 10 am, during morning traffic, was 31 mg/L(11). Average emission rates of various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were measured under the Federal Testing Procedure (FTP) driving cycle, which represents urban driving, and the REP05 driving cycle, which includes conditions outside of the FTP(12). 2-Methylnaphthalene emission rates under the FTP cycle were 3.787, 1.831, and 5.839 mg/mi for tier 0 federal emissions package, tier 1 federal emissions package, and a high emitter category(12). For the REP05 cycle, emission rates were 0.409, 0.298, and 2.482 mg/mi for the same vehicle categories(12).",

Ten surficial sediment samples were collected adjacent to each of four combined sewer overflow (CSO) outfalls along the lower Passaic River in New Jersey; 2-Methylnaphthalene was detected in 80% of the samples from the Ivy Street CSO area with a  median concentration of 220 ug/kg, and in 0-10% of the samples from the other three CSO areas(4). 2-Methylnaphthalene was not detected in suspended solids (detection limit 10.0 ng/g) from four stations along the Rainy River on the Ontario, Canada and Minnesota boarder in samples collected Jun and Aug 1988(5). 2-Methylnaphthalene concentration in suspended solids from the Rainy River where final effluent from two bleached kraft mills discharge directly into the river were 12.0-126 ng/g(5). 2-Methylnaphthalene was detected in sediment samples from 114 sites from 8 historically contaminated locations in New York and North Carolina at 0.01-559 ug/g; samples were collected 2003 to 2005(6). Pore water concentrations of 2-methylnaphthalene from 88 of these samples were not detected to 1288 ng/g(6). 2-Methylnaphthalene was detected in 18 of 18 sediment samples collected from US streams in the Great Lakes basin from Apr to June 2006 at 10-50 ng/g dry weight(7). 2-Methylnaphthalene was not detected in the 0-2 or 28-30 cm segment of a sediment core sample from Wild Harbor, West Falmouth, MA sampled Aug 2000, but was detected in the 14-16 cm at 0.013 ug/g(8).",

Workers at a creosote impregnation plant for lumber were exposed to an average atmospheric concentration of 2-methylnaphthalene of 2.2 mg/cu m for 18 samples(2). 2-Methylnaphthalene was found to be completely in the gaseous phase in the workplace air of an aluminum plant at Soderberg, Norway at an average of 8.94 ug/cu m(3). The concentration of 2-methylnaphthalene in the personal air at the coal preparation area of a solvent refined coal pilot plant was 13.8, 9.4 and 18.9 ug/cu m for a welder and two operators, respectively(4). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-methylnaphthalene via inhalation of ambient air and cigarette smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with products containing 2-methylnaphthalene(SRC).",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

It exhibits similar competitive inhibition at the NMDA receptor and protein kinase C, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Lead also affects the nervous system by impairing regulation of dopamine synthesis and blocking evoked release of acetylcholine. However, it's main mechanism of action occurs by inhibiting delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, an enzyme vital in the biosynthesis of heme, which is a necesssary cofactor of hemoglobin.

Organometals also compromise the limbic system and result in deficits in learning and memory. Since both alcohol and organoleads are present in the environment and seem to influence limbic integration, the interaction of these two compounds was assessed in the present experiment. Thirty male rats of the Fischer-344 strain were divided into three equal groups and were given injections of trimethyl lead (8.0 or 17.0 mg/kg/ml sc) or the saline vehicle. Fourteen days later, all animals were challenged with a single hypnotic dose of ethanol (3.5 g/kg ip). The 20% v/v solution of alcohol was prepared in water from a stock solution of 95% ethanol. The latency to loss of the righting reflex and duration of sleep time were recorded while the rats were kept in sound attenuating chambers. The rats treated with the highest dose of trimethyl lead manifested significantly longer latencies to lose the righting reflex and shorter durations of sleep than did controls. These results suggest that exposure to environmental lead may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to alcohol. /Trimethyllead/",

In urine: 24-hour urine lead levels, delta aminolevulinic acid and coproporphyrin. Sample collection: a 24-hour specimen of urine is preferable to a single specimen; the blood sample should be taken and stored in specially cleaned glassware... Lead in urine after calcium disodium EDTA mobilization test ... In case of recent exposure or poisoning: whole-blood levels rarely exceeds 500 ug/L. Red cell delta-aminolevulinic dehydratase activity is inhibited (normal 30 to 60 IU). The concentration of protoporphyrin in erythrocytes may be increased (normal: 600 ug/L), but the results are inconsistent. In severe organic lead poisoning the concentration of lead in urine is rarely less than 3500 ug/L. The urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA-U) (normal: 4.5 mg/L) and the urinary coproporphyrin (CP-U) (normal: 150 ug/L) may be increased. The urinary lead excretion is increased by calcium disodium EDTA or D-penicillamine). Anaemia and basophilic stippling are uncommon. These findings occur in chronic exposure, as in gasoline sniffing cases, but the chemical and morphological abnormalities in blood are absent in acute exposure ... Other biomedical (diagnostic) investigations and their interpretation: Serum creatinine, urinalysis, 24-hour creatinine and protein (evaluation of renal function). Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT): muscle and hepatic damage. Peripheral motor nerve conduction velocity (damage to peripheral nerves) only in cases of chronic exposure. Intelligence and personality tests: evaluation of psychological and neurological impairment. Electroencephalogram: in cases of lead encephalopathy ... /Organic lead/",

The undiluted test material infused into a glass bubbler was vaporized and supplied as a dried metered airstream at 2.8 L/min into a bell jar containing the rats. No mortality or clinical signs of toxicity were noted and no treatment-related gross pathology was revealed upon necropsy 3 days after the final exposure. Select harvested tissues were dried in a hot air oven at 100 degrees C to a constant weight, ashed and burned with nitric acid, and then heated to burn off the nitrates. The residue in hydrochloric acid was then analyzed for Pb content according to a method of W.W. Woessner and J. Cholak. A group average for 4 rats revealed that lead constituted 0.73, 1.72, 0.16, 5.45, 4.0, 5.93, and 5.50 mg respectively of 100 g bone, brain, fat, kidney, liver, lung, and spleen tissue.",

As Me4Pb is not soluble in water and is volatile, the exposure of an alga to this lead compound was only momentary. It was estimated that <0.5 mg of Pb (Me4Pb) had passed through the culture medium. The primary productivity and cell growth (determined by dry weight), however, decreased by 85% and 32% respectively, as compared with the controls without exposure to Me4Pb. Furthermore, cells exposed to Me4Pb tended to clump together and striking alterations in cell fine-structure were observed. An electron microscopic analysis by an energy dispersive spectrometer revealed that Pb ions had penetrated the cell and were deposited within concretion bodies. Similar results were obtained with the green algae Ankistrodesmus falcatus and Chlorella pyrenoidosa.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 26 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tetramethyl lead will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tetramethyl lead will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.5 days. Particulate-phase tetramethyl lead will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Half-lives for the direct photolysis of vapor-phase tetramethyl lead exposed to bright sunlight at solar zenith angles of 40 and 75 deg in air are 8.3 and 34 hours. If released to soil, organic matter in the soil will influence tetramethyl lead's mobility because possibilities exist for inhibited mobility by sorption to soil organic matter and for enhanced mobility by the formation of soluble chelate complexes with soluble organic anions. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.61 atm-cu m/mole. Tetramethyl lead may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data are not available for tetramethyl lead. If released into water, organic matter in the suspended solids and sediment may influence tetramethyl lead's mobility. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.8 hours and 6.5 days, respectively. BCF values ranging from 20 to 700 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to high. Tetramethyl lead is expected to undergo hydrolysis based on a reported hydrolysis half-life of 4.38 days in seawater. Occupational exposure to tetramethyl lead may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tetramethyl lead is produced or used. The use of tetraalkyl lead additives in on-road automotive gasoline is no longer permitted in the United States; however tetraethyl lead is still used in leaded aviation gasoline. When burned, tetraethyl leaded fuels can produce other alkyllead compounds (such as tetramethyl lead). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to tetramethyl lead via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing tetramethyl lead, such as leaded gasoline.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3.5 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the hydrolysis degradation of tetramethyl lead in seawater has been reported to be 1.83X10-6/sec(3), which corresponds to a half-life of 4.38 days(SRC). Degradation of tetramethyl lead in seawater leads to the formation of trimethyl lead chloride(4). Tetramethyl lead is expected to hydrolyze in fresh water based on the half-life hydrolysis rate in fresh water for tetraethyl lead, a chemical analogue, of 8 days(5). The rate constants for the direct photolysis of gas-phase tetramethyl lead exposed to bright sunlight at solar zenith angles of 40 and 75 deg have been experimentally determined to be 1.4X10-3/min and 3.38X10-4/min, respectively(6). These rate constants correspond to half-lives of 8.3 and 34 hours, respectively(SRC).",

A laboratory study has shown that sunlight accelerates tetramethyl lead degradation in water(2). Degradation of tetramethyl lead in water yields trialkyl and dialkyl lead compounds(2). In the dark, tetramethyl lead was completely decomposed within 5 days when present in environmental water(3). Photolytic degradation of tetramethyl lead in seawater has also been observed(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4.8 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 6.5 days(SRC). Tetramethyl lead's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of tetramethyl lead from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Consequently they can readily modify free thiols (cysteines) and methionine residues of the surfaces of proteins leading to the disruption of enzyme, transporter or membrane functions.  One of the most probable protein targets is the TRPA1 ion channel that is expressed in sensory nerves (trigeminal nerve) of the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs. Human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes E1 and E2 are both completely and irreversibly inactivated by phenacyl bromide. This kind targeted modification may lead to liver toxicity.",

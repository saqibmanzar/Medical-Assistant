Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Incompatible with isocyanates, aldehydes, cyanides, peroxides, and anhydrides. May react violently with aldehydes, HNO3, HNO3 + H2O2, and HClO4. Irritating vapors and toxic gases may be formed when involved in fire (USCG, 1999).",

Large multiple doses (1.5 g/kg/day, 5 days/week, 14 weeks) of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) given by gavage potentiated EBK (2 g/kg/day, 5 days/week for 14 weeks) neurotoxicity but 5-methyl-2-octanone did not. MEK modestly increased the urinary excretion of two neurotoxic gamma-diketones, 2,5-heptanedione, and 2,5-hexanedione, when MEK was given by gavage with EBK. When rats were exposed to EBK (700 ppm) and MEK (700 or 1400 ppm) in combination by inhalation exposure, serum 2,5-heptanedione levels were increased approximately 2.5 times. This effect was absent at MEK levels of 70 ppm. The serum from rats exposed to EBK or EBK/MEK combinations did not contain 2,5-hexanedione. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.6 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates 3-heptanone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-heptanone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. 3-Heptanone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-heptanone is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 44. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 3-Heptanone may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 3-Heptanone was biodegraded 3.7 % in 1 day using an activated sludge inoculum at 20 \u00b0C. If released into water, 3-heptanone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hours and 7.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 6 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 3-heptanone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-heptanone is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 3-heptanone via inhalation of ambient air and via ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

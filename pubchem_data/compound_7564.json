When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Of these, 184 were patch tested with an Italian standard allergen series and a hairdresser's allergen series. ... The subjects had been employed as hairdressers a mean of 5.3 years. ... Among hair dye allergens, p-phenylenediamine, para-aminodiphenylamine, o-nitro-p-phenylenediamine, and para-toluenediamine caused a high incidence of positive reactions, 24.2, 10.6, 7.9, and 13.2%, respectively. ... It was concluded that a high proportion of hairdressers who seek treatment for skin problems have allergic contact dermatitis.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.21X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates p-aminodiphenylamine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase p-aminodiphenylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.9 hours. Particulate-phase p-aminodiphenylamine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. p-Aminodiphenylamine contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, p-aminodiphenylamine is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3.1X10+3. The pKa of p-aminodiphenylamine is 5.20, indicating that this compound will partially exist in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. p-Aminodiphenylamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Reported inherent biodegradation values of 28% after 20 days in an adapted activated sludge and 58% after 3 hours in a mixed, non-adapted activated sludge inoculum suggest that biodegradation in the aquatic environment may be an important fate process. If released into water, p-aminodiphenylamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Reported inherent biodegradation values of 28% after 20 days in an adapted activated sludge and 58% after 3 hours in a mixed, non-adapted activated sludge inoculum suggest that biodegradation in the aquatic environment may be an important fate process. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A pKa of 5.20 indicates p-aminodiphenylamine will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 5.1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to p-aminodiphenylamine may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where p-aminodiphenylamine is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to p-aminodiphenylamine via dermal contact with consumer products containing p-aminodiphenylamine. (SRC)",

The pKa of p-aminodiphenylamine is 5.20(3), indicating that this compound will partially exist in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Volatilization of p-aminodiphenylamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(5). p-Aminodiphenylamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.21X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(6). Reported inherent biodegradation values of 28% after 20 days in an adapted activated sludge and 58% after 3 hours in a mixed, non-adapted activated sludge inoculum(7) suggest that biodegradation in the aquatic environment may be an important fate process(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). A pKa of 5.20(5) indicates p-aminodiphenylamine will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 5.1(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 1.82(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Reported inherent biodegradation values of 28% after 20 days in an adapted activated sludge and 58% after 3 hours in a mixed, non-adapted activated sludge inoculum(10) suggest that biodegradation in the aquatic environment may be an important fate process(SRC).",

Vapor-phase p-aminodiphenylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.9 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.0X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase p-aminodiphenylamine may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). p-Aminodiphenylamine contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

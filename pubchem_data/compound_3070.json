PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Some analogs have been found to reduce elevated parathyroid hormone concentrations in patients with renal osteodystrophy associated with hyperparathyroidism. Theoretically, any of the vitamin D analogs may be used for the above conditions, However, because of their pharmacologic properties, some may be more useful in certain situations than others. Alfacalcidol, calcitriol, and dihydrotachysterol are usually preferred in patients with renal failure since these patients have impaired ability to synthesize calcitriol from cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol; therefore, the response is more predictable. In addition, their shorter half-lives may make toxicity easier to manage (hypercalcemia reverses more quickly). Ergocalciferol may not be the preferred agent in the treatment of familial hypophosphatemia or hypoparathyroidism because the large doses needed are associated with a risk of overdose and hypercalcemia; dihydrotachysterol and calcitriol may be preferred. /Included in US product labeling/",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.2X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dihydrotachysterol will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase dihydrotachysterol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Dihydrotachysterol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dihydrotachysterol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2.5X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Dihydrotachysterol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available for dihydrotachysterol. If released into water, dihydrotachysterol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may occur based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 9 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 5.3X10+5 years when adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 3.1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to dihydrotachysterol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dihydrotachysterol is produced or used. Exposure to dihydrotachysterol among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug Hytakerol. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces may occur(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 9 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 5.3X10+5 years when adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3.2(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 10(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2006).",

Dihydrotachysterol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Dihydrotachysterol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that dihydrotachysterol may volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 9 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 5.3X10+5 years when adsorption is considered(3). Dihydrotachysterol's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). Dihydrotachysterol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 5.2X10-10 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(4).",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

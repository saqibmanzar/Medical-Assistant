PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In short term experiments (1 hr), tetramethylammonium chloride, triethanolammonium chloride, guanidinium chloride, tris hydrochloride, mannitol, sucrose, LiCl, RbCl and CsCl were well tolerated. In long term exposure (4 days), no compound was completely nontoxic as a sodium substitute, but sucrose, mannitol, LiCl, and RbCl allowed maximum cell survival.",

Its use in hydrofracking fluid as a clay stabilizer will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.2X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tetramethylammonium chloride will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tetramethylammonium chloride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 25 hours. Particulate-phase tetramethylammonium chloride will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Tetramethylammonium chloride does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tetramethylammonium chloride is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8. Tetramethylammonium chloride is a quaternary ammonium salt, indicating that this compound will exist in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. No biodegradation occurred using activated sludge in a respirometer test suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water; cation compounds are known to be toxic to microorganisms. If released into water, tetramethylammonium chloride is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Tetramethylammonium chloride is a salt and exists in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9; therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound is a quaternary ammonium salt. Occupational exposure to tetramethylammonium chloride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tetramethylammonium chloride is produced or used. (SRC)",

Tetramethylammonium chloride is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 1.2X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5).

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-12 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Tetramethylammonium chloride is a salt and exists in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9; therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -4.18(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). That no biodegradation occurred using activated sludge in a respirometer test(5) suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water; cation compounds are known to be toxic to microorganisms(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

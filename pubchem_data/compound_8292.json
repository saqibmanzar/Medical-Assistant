The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

After a conventional clean-up, gas chromatographic (GC) analysis was performed in a GC equipped with 2 fused-silica capillary columns coated with methylsilicone SP 2100 and methylphenylsilicone OV-17. The effluent from each column was split to electron-capture and N-P detectors, which were connected to a dual channel integrator. From each GC ran parallel records of signals from the 2 detectors. Calibration of the system was carried out for the SP 2100 column with 3 test mixtures covering all pesticides. Four internal standards were included, 2 responding to the electron-capture detector and the other 2 to the N-P detector. Automated analysis was performed with test mixtures and food samples on the SP 2100 column overnight as a screening procedure. After selection of positive samples a confirmatory test and quantitation were carried out manually applying appropriate test mixtures according to the results of the screening runs."

Bifenthrin was 1.9 times more toxic to bees that were caged with Apistan Queen Tabs than to bees held in cages without Apistan. The toxicity of carbaryl and methyl parathion was not significantly affected by Apistan treatment. The possibility that honey bee colonies being treated with Apistan are more susceptible to injury by bifenthrin is supported by data obtained in this study. However, susceptibility of colonies to carbaryl or methyl parathion does not appear to be affected by prior Apistan exposure. /SRP: Contains polyvinyl chloride, acetyl tributyl citrate, epoxidized soybean oil, tan-flavalinate, titanium dioxide, and stearic acid/",

The percent of each pesticide in the mixture was proportional to its average concentration in foods. Incubated with the lymphocytes at a concentration of 1-20 ug/mL the pesticide mixture did not induce significant variations in the number of hypodiploid, hyperdiploid and polyploid cells or in the number of chromosome and chromatid aberrations. On the contrary, we observed a dose-dependent increase in the number of nonsynchronous centromeric separations which reached the level of 37.9% at 20 ug/mL of pesticide mixture in the incubation medium. This effect was not observed when benomyl was excluded from the mixture. These data show that the removal of benomyl could decrease the toxicity of pesticide residues present in human food.",

Respiratory distress, in fact, is commonly found in these patients from multiple causes. ... 4. Cardiac Monitoring. ... 5. Cholinesterase Level. ... 6. Pralidoxime. Pralidoxime is the treatment of choice for organophosphate poisoning and should be used for nearly all patients with clinically significant orgnophosphate poisoning, particularly whose patients with muscular fasciculations and weakness. ... 7. Atropine. Atropine is the physiologic antidote for organophosphate poisoning.

The purpose is to detect pre-existing conditions that might place the exposed employee at increased risk, and to establish a baseline for future health monitoring. ... Examination of the respiratory system, nervous system, cardiovascular system, eyes, and attention to cholinesterase levels in the blood should be stressed. The skin should be examined for evidence of chronic skin disorders. Cholinesterase determination: Parathion causes depressed levels of activity of cholinesterase in the serum and erythrocytes. The cholinesterase activity in the serum and erythrocytes should be determined by using medically acceptable biochemical tests prior to any new period of exposure. The aforementioned medical examinations should be repeated on an annual basis, with the exception of cholinesterase determination. This test should be performed at four week intervals, except for those individuals in areas which may involve intense exposure, for whom the test should be repeated weekly. If any employee works with parathion more than 12 hr per day, they should also be tested every three weeks. Employees should also be tested at any time over-exposure is suspected or signs or symptoms of toxicity appear.

Detection of these metabolites is a useful screening test for exposure, since the degradation of most organophosphate pesticides produces only these six metabolites. Detection of dimethylphosphate and diethyl phosphate have been found to be directly attributable to pesticide exposure. Detection of dimethyldithiophosphate and diethyldithiophosphate is difficult since they are rapidly degraded and are less directly associated with pesticide exposure, while dimethylthiophosphate and diethylthiophosphate levels can be produced from other non-pesticide sources, limiting their usefulness as markers for pesticide absorption. The one limitation to measurement of urinary alkyl metabolites is that this test is only useful for assessing recent exposure, due to the short half-life of organophosphate pesticides. In addition, there are tests for specific urinary phenolic metabolites of certain organophosphate pesticides such as parathion (metabolite, p-nitrophenol). However, since each pesticide gives rise to a different phenol metabolite, it is probably not feasible to identify each urinary metabolite.

The inhibition of RBC cholinesterase is theoretically a better indicator of biological effect than serum cholinesterase, since it is analogous to the enzyme that is found in nervous system tissues and any changes should be indicative of neurological toxicity. RBC cholinesterase is useful for assessing exposure as far back as several months, while serum cholinesterase is only useful for assessing exposure within the last month. Pseudocholinesterase is usually depressed before RBC cholinesterase, but is only representative of exposure to organophosphate pesticides and not a neurological effect. Many factors such as age, race, sex, disease state, and pregnancy have been demonstrated to affect both red blood cell and serum cholinesterase in the body. The acute cholinergic effects that are caused by exposure to organophosphate pesticides have been found to correlate with cholinesterase inhibition. Based on the guidelines established by the state of California, measurement of both RBC and serum cholinesterase levels is recommended, since certain organophosphate pesticides have been demonstrated to produce RBC or serum cholinesterase-specific effects. It is generally recommended that baseline levels be obtained prior to exposure, if possible, to better assess cholinesterase depression from pesticide exposure. BAT for Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors:(sampling time is end of exposure or end of shift, or for long-term exposures sampling times is after several shifts: both measured as acetylcholinesterase in erythrocytes): Reduction of activity to 70% of reference value. In addition, the ACGIH has established a BEI for exposure to organophosphate pesticides, based on measurement of red blood cell cholinesterase. However, in order to assess cholinesterase effects, it is necessary to have established a baseline level prior to exposure, for comparison purposes. BEI (sampling time is discretionary): 70% of individual's baseline. /Organophosphate pesticides/"

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates fensulfothion will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase fensulfothion will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.5 hours. Particulate-phase fensulfothion will be physically removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, fensulfothion is expected to have moderate mobility based upon a Koc of 300. Volatilization from moist and dry soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-10 atm-cu m/mole and this compound's vapor pressure, respectively. Biodegradation of fensulfothion is expected to be an important fate process in soil and water based upon soil half-lives of < or = to 1 week; the half-life in sterilized soil was greater than 24 weeks. If released into water, some adsorption of fensulfothion to suspended solids and sediment in the water column is expected based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 29 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be a slow process in natural waters based upon hydrolysis half-lives ranging from 16 to 87 weeks. Occupational exposure to fensulfothion may occur through inhalation of spray mists and dermal contact with this insecticide during or after its application. The general population may be exposed to fensulfothion via ingestion of contaminated food. (SRC)",

Volatilization of fensulfothion from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(3). Fensulfothion is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon a vapor pressure of 5.0X10-5 mm Hg(2). Fensulfothion degraded rapidly in a sandy loam soil to fensulfothion sulfone(4). Field application of 50 ppm fensulfothion was reduced to 5 ppm after 120 days in the first year of application; however, in the second year of application, less than 0.2 ppm remained after 60 days, which was attributed to microbial adaptation(5). In laboratory studies, the initial half-life of fensulfothion in a sandy loam soil (organic matter 2.9%) and in an organic soil (organic matter 48.7%) was less than one week and one week, respectively, but was greater than 24 weeks in the same soils which had been sterilized by autoclaving(6). In a greenhouse study using an organic soil containing 65% organic matter, the initial half-life of fensulfothion applied at normal insecticidal concn was about 3 to 5 weeks with a slightly faster disappearance exhibited in wetter soil(7). Persistence of fensulfothion (as measured by larvae mortality) ranged from 3 to 10 weeks in greenhouse and field studies of a sandy loam soil(8).",

Fensulfothion is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 29(3,SRC), from a log Kow of 2.23(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The aqueous hydrolysis half-life of fensulfothion in distilled water at 25 \u00b0C was relatively independent of pH over the range of 4.5 to 8.0 with half-lives of 58, 87, 77, and 69 weeks at pH 8.0, 7.0, 6.0, and 4.5, respectively(7). The half-life of fensulfothion in sterilized natural water at 20 \u00b0C was 16 weeks(8). Based upon the biodegradation of fensulfothion in soil(9,10), biodegradation may be an important process in water(SRC).",

Field application of 50 ppm fensulfothion was reduced to 5 ppm after 120 days in the first year of application; however, in the second year of application, less than 0.2 ppm remained after 60 days, which was attributed to microbial adaptation; the microorganisms involved in the degradation were identified as a species of Pseudomonas(2). Incubation of a nutrient media with soil microorganisms resulted in a 60% fensulfothion degradation over a 20-week period as compared to a 45% degradation in sterile controls; a fensulfothion sulfone metabolite was found in inoculated samples but not sterile samples; fensulfothion sulfide, in small amounts, was found in both sterile and inoculated samples; addition of 1% ethanol to inoculated samples to induce anaerobic conditions resulted in a rapid disappearance of fensulfothion (half-life of 1.5 weeks) with a large conversion to fensulfothion sulfide(3). Fensulfothion degraded rapidly in a sandy loam soil to fensulfothion sulfone(4). In a greenhouse study using an organic soil containing 65% organic matter, the initial half-life of fensulfothion applied at normal insecticidal concn was about 3 to 5 weeks with a slightly faster disappearance exhibited in wetter soil(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Water and ditch sediment samples were taken in early spring in the first wk of May each year starting in 1985, prior to any pesticide application. Subsequent samples were taken in July, shortly after treatment. Further samples were obtained during the rainy and wet season, ie, in Oct, Dec, and Feb of the following year.

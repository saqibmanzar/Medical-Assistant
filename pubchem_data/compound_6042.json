When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients were randomized to 1 week of double-blind inpatient therapy with either iv thiamine 200 mg/d or placebo (n = 15 each). All previous drugs were continued. Following discharge, all 30 patients received oral thiamine 200 mg/d as outpatients for 6 weeks. Thiamine status was determined by the erythrocyte thiamine-pyrophosphate effect (TPPE). LVEF was determined by echocardiography. RESULTS: TPPE, diuresis, and LVEF were unchanged with iv placebo. After iv thiamine, TPPE decreased (11.7% +/- 6.5% to 5.4% +/- 3.2%; P < 0.01). LVEF increased (0.28 +/- 0.11 to 0.32 +/- 0.09; P < 0.05), as did diuresis (1,731 +/- 800 mL/d to 2,389 +/- 752 mL/d; P < 0.02), and sodium excretion (84 +/- 52 mEq/d to 116 +/- 83 mEq/d, P < 0.05). In the 27 patients completing the full 7-week intervention, LVEF rose by 22% (0.27 +/- 0.10 to 0.33 +/- 0.11, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Thiamine repletion can improve left ventricular function and biochemical evidence of thiamine deficiency in some patients with moderate-to-severe CHF who are receiving longterm furosemide therapy.",

These reactions have ranged in severity from very mild to, very rarely, fatal anaphylactic shock ... The UK Committee on Safety of Medicines had received, between 1970 and July, 1988, 90 reports of adverse reactions associated with the use of an injection containing high doses of vitamins B and C. The most frequent reactions were anaphylaxis (41 cases, including 2 fatalities), dyspnea or bronchospasm (13 cases), and rash or flushing (22 cases); 78 of the reactions occurred during, or shortly after, intravenous injection and the other 12 after intramuscular injectdion. They recommended that parenteral treatment be used only when essential, and that, when given, facilities for treating anaphylaxis should be available. They also recommended that, when the intravenous route was used, the injection be given slowly (over 10 minutes). Various authors have noted that parenteral treatment is essential for the prophylaxis and treatment  of Wernicke's encephalopathy. However, further reports of anaphylaxis to parenteral thiamine have since been described, including one with a fatal outcome.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

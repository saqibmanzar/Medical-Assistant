For patients already receiving the drug, the likelihood that abrupt withdrawal would pose an even greater risk than that of possible felbamate-associated aplastic anemia or acute hepatic failure also should be considered in the decision to discontinue therapy with the drug.

The rate of aplastic anemia cases currently reported with the drug appears to be at least 40-100 times higher than the expected rate of 2-5 cases per million untreated individuals per year. However, because the onset of felbamate-induced aplastic anemia typically is delayed for weeks to months after initiation of the drug and a substantial fraction of patients had felbamate therapy withdrawn for other reasons prior to this period, the absolute rate of this anemia associated with felbamate probably is higher than the currently reported rate of 1 case per 5000 patients per year. Based on this probability, the manufacturer estimates that the actual risk of aplastic anemia associated with felbamate therapy may be as high as 1 case per 2000 patients (500 cases per million patients) per year or more among those who remain on the drug for longer than a few weeks. While postmarketing surveillance usually captures only a fraction of incident cases, the syndrome is still relatively rare, and no cases were observed during premarket testing in which more than 1600 patients received felbamate therapy. All reports of aplastic anemia associated with felbamate therapy to date have occurred in patients receiving the drug for at least 5 weeks.",

While current experience and data are too limited to estimate reliably the fatality rate associated with felbamate-induced aplastic anemia, the estimated case fatality rate for untreated individuals with aplastic anemia from any cause ranges from 20-30%. However, historical fatality rates as high as 70% have been reported for aplastic anemia, and the risk of death secondary to this anemia generally varies with severity and etiology. Although most reported cases have been in white females, risk factors for the development of aplastic anemia in patients receiving felbamate therapy have not been identified. Whether age (range for cases to date: 12-68 years old), gender, or race of the patient, duration of exposure to the drug, dosage, or concomitant use of other anticonvulsant agents or drugs affects the incidence of aplastic anemia in patients receiving felbamate remains to be established. Therefore, the manufacturer recommends that felbamate therapy be discontinued in any patient receiving the drug and alternative therapy initiated as necessary, unless in the clinician's judgment continued felbamate therapy outweighs the risk for aplastic anemia.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

However, its use has been restricted because of association with occurrence of rare cases of aplastic anemia and hepatic failure. Since it was shown that FBM metabolism requires glutathione (GSH), we used two experimental protocols to determine if the effects of specific metabolites were sensitive to redox pathways. FBM and its metabolite W873 (2-phenyl-1,3-propanediol monocarbamate), at 0.1 mg/mL, induced increased apoptosis of bone marrow cells from B10.AKM mice as compared with B10.BR mice. Study of the effects of the drug on human promonocytic cell line U937 cells showed that FBM and the metabolite W2986 [2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3 propanediol dicarbamate], at higher concentrations (0.5 mg/mL), induced apoptosis in this cell line. We also observed that while FBM and its metabolites induced increased apoptosis of B cells with reduced intracellular GSH levels, addition of exogenous GSH decreased apoptosis induced by W873 but did not significantly affect apoptosis induced by FBM or W2986. /The authors/ results suggest that, at concentrations used during the present investigations, FBM metabolites induce apoptosis via redox-sensitive and redox-independent pathways.",

It was proposed that a bioactivation of FBM leading to formation of alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, atropaldehyde (ATPAL) could be responsible for toxicities associated with the parent drug. Other members of this class of compounds, acrolein and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), are known for their reactivity and toxicity. It has been proposed that the bioactivation of FBM to ATPAL proceeds though a more stable cyclized product, 4-hydroxy-5-phenyltetrahydro-1,3-oxazin-2-one (CCMF) whose formation has been shown recently. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and glutathione transferase (GST) are detoxifying enzymes and targets for reactive aldehydes. This study examined effects of ATPAL and its precursor, CCMF on ALDH, GST and cell viability in liver, the target tissue for its metabolism and toxicity. A known toxin, HNE, which is also a substrate for ALDH and GST, was used for comparison. Interspecies difference in metabolism of FBM is well documented, therefore, human tissue was deemed most relevant and used for these studies. ATPAL inhibited ALDH and GST activities and led to a loss of hepatocyte viability. Several fold greater concentrations of CCMF were necessary to demonstrate a similar degree of ALDH inhibition or cytotoxicity as observed with ATPAL. This is consistent with CCMF requiring prior conversion to the more proximate toxin, ATPAL. GSH was shown to protect against ALDH inhibition by ATPAL. In this context, ALDH and GST are detoxifying pathways and their inhibition would lead to an accumulation of reactive species from FBM metabolism and/or metabolism of other endogenous or exogenous compounds and predisposing to or causing toxicity. Therefore, mechanisms of reactive aldehydes toxicity could include direct interaction with critical cellular macromolecules or indirect interference with cellular detoxification mechanisms.",

A predominant effect on any particular cell process has not been demonstrated to date, but felbamate appears to exhibit a spectrum of anticonvulsant activity that is pharmacologically distinct from other currently available agents. In animals, felbamate protects against seizures induced by electrical stimulation, suggesting that it would be effective in the management of tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures and partial seizures. In animals, felbamate also protects against seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol, indicating that it may be effective in the management of absence (petit mal) seizures. Felbamate also protects against seizures in animals induced by picrotoxin, glutamate, or N-methyl-d, l-aspartic acid; it does not protect against seizures induced by bicuculline or strychnine.",

Its unique clinical profile is thought to be due to an interaction with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, resulting in decreased excitatory amino acid neurotransmission. To further characterize the interaction between felbamate and NMDA receptors, recombinant receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes were used to investigate the subtype specificity and mechanism of action. Felbamate reduced NMDA- and glycine-induced currents most effectively at NMDA receptors composed of NR1 and NR2B subunits (IC50 = 0.93 mM), followed by NR1-2C (2.02 mM) and NR1-2A (8.56 mM) receptors. The NR1-2B-selective interaction was noncompetitive with respect to the coagonists NMDA and glycine and was not dependent on voltage. Felbamate enhanced the affinity of the NR1-2B receptor for the agonist NMDA by 3.5-fold, suggesting a similarity in mechanism to other noncompetitive antagonists such as ifenprodil. However, a point mutation at position 201 (E201R) of the epsilon2 (mouse NR2B) subunit that affects receptor sensitivity to ifenprodil, haloperidol, and protons reduced the affinity of NR1-epsilon2 receptors for felbamate by only 2-fold. Furthermore, pH had no effect on the affinity of NR1-2B receptors for felbamate. /Investigators/ suggest that felbamate interacts with a unique site on the NR2B subunit (or one formed by NR1 plus NR2B) that interacts allosterically with the NMDA/glutamate binding site. These results suggest that the unique clinical profile of felbamate is due in part to an interaction with the NR1-2B subtype of NMDA receptor.",

Patch-clamp recordings in the whole-cell configuration were performed. Ba++ ions as the charge carrier for Ca++ channels were used. In pyramidal cortical cells, FBM dose-dependently reduced high-voltage-activated Ca++ currents in all the tested neurons. At concentrations of 30 to 100 nM, FBM already produced a significant inhibition of high-voltage-activated Ca++ currents (-6/-15%). At saturating concentrations (1-3 microM), FBM-mediated inhibition averaged 44%. The responses were fully reversible. The dose-response curves revealed IC50 of 504 nM. In striatal neurons, FBM decreased the same conductances by about 28%; the threshold dose was 1 to 2 microM, with an IC50 of 18.7 microM. In both structures, the observed inhibitions were unaffected by omega-conotoxin GVIA and omega-agatoxin IVA, suggesting that N-like channels and P-Like channels were not involved in the FBM-mediated responses. In addition, when omega-conotoxin GVIA and omega-agatoxin IVA (100 nM) were coapplied, the FBM-mediated inhibition on the remaining Ca++ currents averaged 87%. The FBM responses were occluded by micromolar concentrations of nifedipine, supporting a direct interference with dihydropyridine-sensitive channels. It is concluded that the described effect of FBM might represent an efficacious mechanism for either controlling spike discharge from epileptic foci or protecting neurons from excessive Ca++ loading.",

Antagonism of the NMDA receptor glycine binding site may block the effects of the excitatory amino acids and suppress seizure activity.

The onset of injury is 1 to 6 months after starting therapy and the pattern of enzyme elevations is typically hepatocellular. More than a dozen instances of acute liver failure and death were attributed to felbamate before severe restrictions were placed upon its use. Felbamate has not been associated with anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome and is a potential alternative for persons who have developed that syndrome from other anticonvulsants.",

The single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of felbamate were examined in an open-label two-dose level parallel group study in 24 elderly (66 to 78-year-old) and 11 young (18 to 45-year-old) healthy volunteer subjects. Pharmacokinetics were determined from blood samples obtained over 120 hr after administration of single 600 mg or 1200 mg doses, and after multiple doses of 600 mg or 1200 mg administered every 12 hr. Safety and tolerability were assessed through laboratory tests, ECGs, vital signs and reported adverse events. Single dose felbamate pharmacokinetic parameters differed between young and elderly subjects; compared with young subjects, elderly subjects had lower mean clearance (31.2 vs 25.1 mL min(-1); 90% CI -11.4 to -0.9; P = 0.02) and a trend towards a greater half-life (18.6 vs 21.0 hr; 90% CI -0.6 to 5.4; P = 0.11). Mean AUC and C(max) values were also higher in elderly subjects. No gender differences were noted for weight-adjusted pharmacokinetic variables. Felbamate was less well tolerated in elderly subjects compared with young subjects, as shown by higher rates of adverse event reporting and dropouts at the higher dose level. ...",

The rate of aplastic anemia cases currently reported with the drug appears to be at least 40-100 times higher than the expected rate of 2-5 cases per million untreated individuals per year. However, because the onset of felbamate-induced aplastic anemia typically is delayed for weeks to months after initiation of the drug and a substantial fraction of patients had felbamate therapy withdrawn for other reasons prior to this period, the absolute rate of this anemia associated with felbamate probably is higher than the currently reported rate of 1 case per 5000 patients per year. Based on this probability, the manufacturer estimates that the actual risk of aplastic anemia associated with felbamate therapy may be as high as 1 case per 2000 patients (500 cases per million patients) per year or more among those who remain on the drug for longer than a few weeks. While postmarketing surveillance usually captures only a fraction of incident cases, the syndrome is still relatively rare, and no cases were observed during premarket testing in which more than 1600 patients received felbamate therapy. All reports of aplastic anemia associated with felbamate therapy to date have occurred in patients receiving the drug for at least 5 weeks.",

While current experience and data are too limited to estimate reliably the fatality rate associated with felbamate-induced aplastic anemia, the estimated case fatality rate for untreated individuals with aplastic anemia from any cause ranges from 20-30%. However, historical fatality rates as high as 70% have been reported for aplastic anemia, and the risk of death secondary to this anemia generally varies with severity and etiology. Although most reported cases have been in white females, risk factors for the development of aplastic anemia in patients receiving felbamate therapy have not been identified. Whether age (range for cases to date: 12-68 years old), gender, or race of the patient, duration of exposure to the drug, dosage, or concomitant use of other anticonvulsant agents or drugs affects the incidence of aplastic anemia in patients receiving felbamate remains to be established. Therefore, the manufacturer recommends that felbamate therapy be discontinued in any patient receiving the drug and alternative therapy initiated as necessary, unless in the clinician's judgment continued felbamate therapy outweighs the risk for aplastic anemia.",

The maximum dosages used in these studies produced steady-state plasma felbamate concentrations that were equal to or less than the steady-state plasma concentrations in patients with epilepsy receiving 3600 mg of the drug daily. There was an increase in hepatic cell adenomas in male and female mice receiving the high dosages as well as in female rats receiving the high dosages. Hepatic hypertrophy also was increased in a dose-related manner in mice, principally in males, but also in females. Hepatic hypertrophy was not found in female rats. The relationship between the occurrence of benign hepatocellular adenomas and the finding of liver hypertrophy resulting from hepatic enzyme induction has not been evaluated. There also was an increase in benign interstitial cell tumors of the testes in male rats receiving high dosages of felbamate.",

Plasma and urine samples were obtained for 144 hr following administration of a single 1200 mg dose. Compared with controls, apparent total body clearance, renal clearance and urinary excretion of felbamate were decreased, and half-life, Cmax and AUC values were increased in subjects with renal dysfunction. The magnitude of these changes was associated with the degree of renal dysfunction. Nonrenal clearance and apparent volume of distribution values were also lower in renal dysfunction subjects, but there was no association between the extent of these changes and degree of renal dysfunction. Renal clearance of felbamate accounted for approximately 30% of apparent total body clearance in the control group and from 9-22% in the renal failure patients. Renal clearance of felbamate was significantly correlated with creatinine clearance (r = 0.75; P< 0.001).",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

It can also be used for treatment of poisoning by antimony, bismuth and possibly thallium, and (with sodium calcium edetate) in cases of acute leaad poisoning. Administration is by (painful) intramuscular injection of a suspension of dimercaprol in peanut oil, typically every 4 hours for 2-10 days depending on the toxicity. In the past, dimercaprol was also used for the treatment of Wilson's disease, a severely debilitating genetic disorder in which the body tends to retain copper, with resultant liver and brain injury. It has a role as a chelator. It is a dithiol and a primary alcohol.",

It was developed as an experimental antidote against the arsenic-based poison gas Lewisite. It has been used clinically since 1949 in arsenic, cadmium and mercury poisoning. In addition, it has in the past been used for the treatment of Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder in which the body tends to retain copper. Dimercaprol has toxic potential, and its use may be followed by a variety of adverse effects.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Dimercaprol administration should be accompanied by appropriate supportive measures and is most effective when administered early in the course of the poisoning. In the treatment of acute poisoning by mercury salts, dimercaprol is most effective if administered within 1-2 hours following ingestion, since extensive mercury-induced renal damage cannot be reversed. Dimercaprol is not effective in the treatment of poisonings resulting from monoalkyl mercury compounds, and the drug is only minimally effective in chronic mercury poisoning. Although dimercaprol is usually of no value in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions to mercury compounds, mercury-induced acrodynia (pink disease) in infants and children responds to treatment with dimercaprol. Dimercaprol is usually effective in the treatment of chronic poisoning from inorganic or organic arsenicals, but may be of little value if aplastic anemia, hemorrhagic encephalitis, or jaundice has developed. In one patient who experienced protein-loss enteropathy in association with arsenic poisoning, hypoproteinemia and edema improved following dimercaprol therapy. The drug is ineffective in the treatment of poisoning resulting from arsine gas (AsH3). Gold-induced dermatitis and gold-induced thrombocytopenia may improve following dimercaprol therapy. /Use included in US product label/",

However, dimercaprol is useful as an adjunct to edetate calcium disodium and concomitant administration of the drugs is preferred, at least initially, in the management of patients with severe lead poisoning (blood lead concentrations exceeding 70 ug/dL) and/or in those with acute lead encephalopathy (which occurs most often in children). Concomitant administration of dimercaprol and edetate calcium disodium increases the rate of excretion of lead, lowers mortality, and may lower the incidence of brain damage as compared with the use of edetate calcium disodium alone; however, such concomitant therapy does not completely eliminate the risk of permanent severe residual brain damage. Since lead encephalopathy occurs only rarely in adults, experience with the use of the combination in these patients is limited; however, use of dimercaprol and edetate calcium disodium has resulted in prompt relief of symptoms in a few adults with lead encephalopathy. Although concomitant therapy with dimercaprol and edetate calcium disodium also has been recommended in symptomatic patients with blood lead concentrations less than 70 ug/dL, the American Academy of Pediatrics currently states that the toxicity of dimercaprol and the current availability of alternative drugs mandate its use only in the most serious cases of lead poisoning (i.e., blood lead concentrations exceeding 70 ug/dL or when symptoms suggestive of encephalopathy are present).  Edetate calcium disodium generally is used alone (i.e., without dimercaprol) in asymptomatic patients with blood lead concentrations of 45-70 ug/dL. ... Dimercaprol is not useful in acute poisonings resulting from alkyl lead compounds (e.g., tetraethyl lead). /Use included in US product label/",

Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of ephedrine or an antihistamine may prevent or relieve many of the mild adverse effects of dimercaprol. The most frequent adverse effect, a rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure which is dose related and may be accompanied by tachycardia, may appear 15-30 minutes following the injection and blood pressure usually returns to normal within 2 hours. Frequently pain and occasionally sterile abscesses occur at the injection site, particularly if the drug is not administered deep IM.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The molecular properties of the dimercaprol-metal chelate have considerable practical significance. With metals such as mercury, gold, and arsenic, the strategy is to attain a stable complex to promote elimination of the met al. Dissociation of the complex and oxidation of dimercaprol can occur in vivo. Furthermore, the sulfur-metal bond may be labile in the acidic tubular urine, which may increase delivery of metal to renal tissue and increase toxicity. The dosage regimen therefore is designed to maintain a concentration of dimercaprol in plasma adequate to favor the continuous formation of the more stable 2:1 (BAL-metal) complex and its rapid excretion. However, because of pronounced and dose-related side effects, excessive plasma concentrations must be avoided. The concentration in plasma therefore must be maintained by repeated fractional dosage until the offending metal can be excreted.",

Dimercaprol (BAL) is a compound used in the treatment of mercury intoxication, but presents low therapeutic efficacy. The molecular mechanism responsible for the BAL toxicity is poorly known. In the present study, the effect of BAL and inorganic and organic mercury on Ca2+ transport by Ca2+-ATPases located in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum of fast-skeletal muscle and brain was examined. Ca2+ uptake by brain and fast-skeletal muscle microsomes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by Hg2+. The calculated IC50 for Ca2+ uptake inhibition by HgCl2 was 1.05+/-0.09 microM (n = 8) for brain and 0.72+/-0.06 microM (n = 9) for muscle. The difference was significant at p < 0.01 (data expressed as mean +/- SD). At a low concentration (1 microM), 2,3-dimer-captopropanol had no effect on Ca2+ uptake by brain or muscle vesicles and did not abolish the inhibition caused by Hg2+. A high concentration of BAL (1 mM) nearly abolished the inhibition caused by 1.75 microM HgCl2 or 6 microM CH3HgCl in skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, at intermediate concentrations (40-100 microM) BAL partially inhibited Ca2+ transport in brain but had no effect on muscle. Furthermore, ATP hydrolysis by brain or muscle microsomes was not inhibited by BAL. These results suggest that in brain microsomes BAL affects in a different way Ca2+ transport and ATP hydrolysis. The increase in BAL concentration observed after toxic administration of this compound to experimental animals may contribute to deregulate Ca2+ homoeostasis and, consequently, to the neurotoxicity of BAL.",

It is clear to slightly yellow liquid with a pungent odor of mercaptan. It is slightly soluble in water and vegetable oils. Arachis or peanut oil is used in pharmaceutical preparations. It is miscible in alcohol, benzyl benzoate, ether, methyl alcogol and other solvents. Dimercaprol is useful in the treatment of arsenic (organic and inorganic), gold and inorganic mercury poisoning. HUMAN EXPOSURE: The main risks are hypertension, tachycardia, cardiovascular collapse, convulsions, excitation, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Special care should be taken in case of oliguria, hypertension and impaired hepatic function when the antidote is administered. The target organs are the kidneys, the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. The clinical effects are nausea, vomiting, headache, burning sensation of the lips, throat, mouth and eyes; lacrimation and salivation; sweating, rhinorrhea and burning sensation of the penis; a feeling of constriction or pain in the throat or chest, muscle pains and spasms and tingling of the skin of the hands; abdominal pain, anxiety, nervousness and weakness, uticaria and hyperpyrexia. Pain and sterile abscesses can result. Irritation of the skin and mucous membranes can be observed after local contact. This drug should always be administered as soon as possible by deep IM injection and never by IV or SC routes. Dimercaprol is well tolerated in children. The drug cannot be used in poisonings due to iron, cadmium, tellurium, selenium, vanadium and uranium. It is contraindicated in poisonings due to elemental mercury vapor, because it can further increase the metal in the brain. This drug should not be administered in case of renal and hepatic insufficiency and patients with hypertension. Dermal absorption is possible. Peak concentrations in the blood are obtained 30-60 min after IM injection. Dimercaprol is a lipophilic drug, it penetrates rapidly in intracellular spaces. The highest concentrations are found in the liver, kidneys, brain and small intestine. Glucuronic acid conjugates are excreted by the kidneys. Iron therapy should be given 24 hr or more after the last dose of dimercaprol. It should not be administered at the same time. Breath may smell like odor of a mercaptan. Hemolytic anemia was reported in individuals with G6PD deficiency. In children, dimercaprol may induce a transient reduction in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. ANIMAL STUDIES: In animal studies, the biological half life was short and metabolic degradation and renal excretion is complete within 6-24 hr. In animals a lethal dose of dithiols causes convulsions and severe spasm of the abdominal muscles shortly before death occurs. After injection of sublethal amounts of dimercaprol, the animals become apathetic and develop lacrimation, edema of the conjunctiva, blepharospasms, salivation and vomiting. With increasing doses they develop ataxia, analgesia, muscle tremor, nystagmus, tonic and clonic convulsions and death results during coma. In cats following an IV injection cardiovascular depression as indicated by a fall in systemic and pulmonary artery pressure. After repeated local applications in animals, sensitization dermatitis may develop. Chronic effects in animals include fatty degeneration of the liver and impairment of liver function. In animals, chronic parenteral administration increases white blood cell count by 30%. This drug induced malformations of the skeletal system, growth retardation and increased embryo lethality.",

It is assumed that dimercaprol acts by reactivating target sulfhydryl-containing proteins. In the present investigation we studied the inhibitory effect of mercuric chloride treatment (3 days with 2.3 or 4.6 mg/kg HgCl2, sc) in mice on cerebral. renal and hepatic delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALA-D) activity, and a possible reversal of the effect of mercury by dimercaprol (0.25 mmol/kg, 24 hr after the last mercury injection). Mercuric chloride did not inhibit cerebral delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase at the doses injected. Dimercaprol treatment did not restore the normal enzyme activity of the liver after the 25% inhibition caused by 4.6 mg/kg HgCl2. In the kidney, dimercaprol enhanced the inhibitory effect of 4.6 mg/kg mercuric chloride (from 35% after mercury treatment alone to 65% after mercury plus dimercaprol treatment). Mercury content increased in kidney after exposure to 2.3 or 4.6 mg/kg and the levels attained were higher than in any other organ. Mercury accumulated in liver only after exposure to 4.6 mg/kg HgCl2. and dimercaprol further increased mercury deposition. Dimercaprol treatment also increased the levels of mercury in brain of animals exposed to 4.6 mg/kg HgCl2. The enzymes from all sources presented similar sensitivity to the combined effect of HgCl2 and dimercaprol in vitro. In the absence of preincubation, 0-500 uM dimercaprol potentiated the inhibitory effect of HgCl2 on delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase activity. In the presence of preincubation, and 100 and 250 uM dimercaprol enhanced delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase sensitivity to mercury, whereas 500 uM dimercaprol partially protected the enzyme from mercury inhibition. Dimercaprol (500 uM) inhibited renal and hepatic delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase when preincubated with the enzymes. These data suggested that the dimercaprol-Hg complex may have a more toxic effect on delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase activity than Hg2+. Furthermore, the present data show that dimercaprol did not act by reactivating mercury-inhibited sulfhydryl-containing delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase, and that indeed it may have an inhibitory effect per se depending on the tissue.",

Reactions to dimercaprol occur in approximately 50% of subjects receiving 5 mg/kg intramuscularly. The effects of repeated administration of this dose are not cumulative if an interval of at least 4 hours elapses between injections. One of the most consistent responses to dimercaprol is a rise in systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, accompanied by tachycardia. The rise in pressure may be as great as 50 mmHg in response to the second of two doses (5 mg/kg) given 2 hours apart. The pressure rises immediately but returns to normal within 2 hours.",

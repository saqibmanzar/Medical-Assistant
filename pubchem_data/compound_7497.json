ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

For hydrazine, absorb with DRY sand or inert absorbent (vermiculite or absorbent pads). Use clean, non-sparking tools to collect absorbed material.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The survey was requested by the 40 employees because of eye irritation and dermatitis. Diethylaminoethanol was used to humidify the air in the museum. Air samples and bulk samples were analyzed for diethylaminoethanol. Medical interviews were conducted. Of the 14 samples taken, only 2 had detectable amounts of diethylaminoethanol. The two concentrations were 0.05 and 0.04 mg/cu m. This was below the OSHA standard of 50 mg/cu m. The two bulk samples contained about 30 mg per square meter of exposed area. A total of 46% of the employees complained of eye irritation, 37% complained of skin irritation, and 17% complained of headache, nose and throat irritation, or dizziness. Six females reported gynecological problems. /It was/ concluded that contact with surfaces coated with condensed diethylaminoethanol may be responsible for some of the irritant effects. It is recommended that diethylaminoethanol be wiped from surfaces, or the use of diethylaminoethanol be discontinued.",

The company manufactured electrical circuit boards and electrical equipment for the commercial and defense industries. In September of 1988 two boilers were prepared for operation by adding corrosion inhibitinq chemicals, diethylaminoethanol and cyclohexylamine. Steam produced by the boilers was used for humidity in the work area. Symptoms consistent with acute toxic effects of diethylaminoethanol and cyclohexylamine were noted in 65 of the employees. These included nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and eye, nose, and throat irritation. A significantly higher risk of having several symptoms was noted among the employees in the areas humidified with boiler steam than among employees in the nonboiler steam humidified areas. Employee exposures to metals from solder fumes and methyl-ethyl-ketone were all below established-limits. There was friable asbestos insulation exposed on one boiler. /It was/ concluded that the exposures to the two corrosion inhibiting chemica1s were responsible for the workers' symptoms.",

The request stated that approximately 15 employees in the office support area of a production building had been experiencing rashes since the beginning of March 1981. Environmental samplinq did not reveal any diethylaminoethanol in air samples. However, results of sampling suggested the presence of a conjugated amine which possesses acidic properties. The specific agent could not be identified. Skin examinations revealed an irritant-type rash on the exposed areas of the face neck and hands. The distribution of the rash was consistent with and suggestive of a phototoxic skin reaction. Both the environmental and medical evaluations indicated the source of the dermatitis to be the air-handling system. However, no specific etiologic agent has been identified. The information in the body of the fu11 report suggests that a condensation or reaction product of diethylaminoethanol was likely responsible for the reported symptoms.",

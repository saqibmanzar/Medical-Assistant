PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This mechanism of action is similar to  that of anthracyclines, but clinical evidence suggests the lack of cross-resistance. The  recommended dosage in patients with solid tumors is 90-120 mg/sq m intravenously every 3-4  weeks. Despite the initial encouraging reports from experimental models, m-AMSA has shown no  real impact in the treatment of patients with a wide variety of solid tumors. In relapsed  acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, 20-30% of patients will achieve complete remission. An  increased remission rate is obtained when m-AMSA is combined with other agents, especially  with high-dose cytosine arabinoside, with a complete remission rate of 50-60% in relapsed  patients. Currently, several phase III trials are evaluating m-AMSA combinations against  daunorubicin-containing regimens in patients with previously untreated acute leukemia. The  potential role of these regimens in this disease remains to be defined.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

However, enzymes capable of oxidizing it in non-hepatic tissue have yet to be identified. A potential candidate, that may be relevant to the metabolism of amsacrine in blood and its action in myeloid leukaemias and myelosuppression, is the haem enzyme myeloperoxidase. We have found that the purified human enzyme oxidizes amsacrine to its quinone diimine, either directly or through the production of hypochlorous acid. In comparison, the 4-methyl-5-methylcarboxamide derivative of amsacrine, CI-921 9-[[2-methoxy-4[(methylsulphonyl)-amino]phenyl]amino)-N, 5-dimethyl-4-acridine carboxamide, reacted poorly with myeloperoxidase, although it was oxidized by hypochlorous acid. Detailed studies of the mechanism by which myeloperoxidase oxidizes amsacrine revealed that the semiquinone imine free radical is a likely intermediate in this reaction. Oxidation of amsacrine analogues indicated that factors other than their reduction potential determine how readily they are metabolized by myeloperoxidase. Both amsacrine and CI-921 inhibited production of hypochlorous acid by myeloperoxidase. CI-921 acted by trapping the enzyme as the inactive redox intermediate compound II. Amsacrine inhibited by a different mechanism that may involve conversion of myeloperoxidase to compound III, which is also unable to oxidize Cl-. The susceptibility of amsacrine to oxidation by myeloperoxidase indicates that this reaction may contribute to the cytotoxicity of amsacrine toward neutrophils, monocytes and their precursors.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Here, molecular interactions of the potent antitumor drug amsacrine (m-AMSA), an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, within living K562 cancer cells have been studied using surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectroscopy. The work is based on data of the previously performed model SER experiments dealing with amsacrine/DNA, drug/topoisomerase II and drug/DNA/topoisomerase II complexes in aqueous buffer solutions. The SER data indicated two kinds of amsacrine interactions in the model complexes with topoisomerase II alone or within ternary complex: non-specific (via the acridine moiety) and specific to the enzyme conformation (via the side chain of the drug). These two types of interactions have been both revealed by the micro-SER spectra of amsacrine within living K562 cancer cells. Our data suppose the specific interactions of amsacrine with topoisomerase II via the side chain of the drug (particular feature of the drug/topoisomerase II and ternary complexes) to be crucial for its inhibitory activity.",

This study was conducted to assess the subchronic  toxicity of amsacrine in rats following a cyclic clinical dosing regimen and as a  range-finding experiment for a subsequent carcinogenicity bioassay. Groups of 30 male Wistar  rats were administered drug intravenously at doses of 0, 0.25, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg daily for 5  days followed by 23 days without treatment. This cycle of dosing and recovery was repeated six  times to simulate human clinical usage of the drug. Assessments of hematology, clinical  chemistry, and gross and microscopic pathology were conducted 3 and 21 days following  completion of dosing in the first, third, and sixth cycles. There were no deaths during the  study. Hair loss, diarrhea, tail injuries, chromodacryorrhea, and rhinorrhea were observed  primarily in animals administered 3 mg/kg. Hair loss and diarrhea occurred during periods of  dosing and generally resolved during the recovery phase of each cycle. Both of these signs  became progressively more severe during the latter half of the study. Body weight loss and  reduced food consumption also occurred in the 3 mg/kg group during each week of dosing. At  study termination, mean body weight and food consumption of the 3 mg/kg group were  significantly less than those of controls by approximately 20 and 50%, respectively. Marked,  reversible leukopenia associated with reductions in both neutrophil and lymphocyte counts  occurred in cycles one and three in animals administered 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively.  Reversible neutropenia was also observed in the 3 mg/kg group in cycle 6. Similar effects on  platelet counts were seen in the 3 mg/kg group in all three cycles analyzed. Absolute and  relative testes weights of the 3 mg/kg group were significantly less than the vehicle controls  at all time points in the third and sixth cycles. Relative testes weights were also decreased  in the 1 mg/kg group in cycle 6. Reversible decreases in absolute relative spleen weights  occurred in all drug-treated groups in cycle 1 and for the 3 mg/kg group in cycle 3. Lymphoid  depletion (spleen, thymus, lymph node), marked hypocellularity of bone marrow, segmental  degeneration of seminiferous tubules, and intestinal epithelial cell degeneration were  observed at 3 mg/kg. With the exception of testicular changes which remained evident at the  end of cycle 6, pathologic lesions were reversible during the 23-day recovery period of each  cycle. The results show that the subchronic toxicity of amsacrine is consistent with a  cytotoxic mechanism and that target organs are generally tissues with the highest rates of  cell turnover. The doses administered in this study induced a range of effects which were  minimal at 0.25 mg/kg and dose-limiting at 3 mg/kg and therefore were considered appropriate  for use in the subsequent carcinogenicity bioassay.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

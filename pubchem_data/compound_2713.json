When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A double-blinded randomized clinical trial was performed in 75 HIV/AIDS subjects with oral candidiasis. Clotrimazole troche was prescribed, and the subjects were re-examined every 2 weeks until the lesions were completely eradicated. The subjects were then randomly divided into two groups; 0.12% chlorhexidine (n = 37, aged 22-52 years, mean 34 years) and 0.9% normal saline (n = 38, aged 22-55 years, mean 38 years). They were re-examined every 2 weeks until the next episode was observed. RESULTS: The time to recurrence of oral candidiasis between the chlorhexidine and the saline group was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The following variables were significantly associated with the time of recurrence; frequency of antifungal therapy (P = 0.011), total lymphocyte (P = 0.017), alcohol consumption (P = 0.043), and candidiasis on gingiva (P = 0.048). The subjects with lower lymphocyte showed shorter oral candidiasis-free periods (P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Chlorhexidine showed a small but not statistically significant effect in maintenance of oral candidiasis-free period. This lack of significance may be due to the small sample size. Further study should be performed to better assess the size of the effect, or to confirm our findings.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Foremilk samples (100 mL) were collected from treated and untreated (controls) mammary gland quarters of each cow. Chlorhexidine was extracted from raw milk, and residue concentrations were quantified by use of high-performance liquid chromatography. Foremilk samples from days 2, 5, and 8 were analyzed in phase I, and samples from time 0 and days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 were analyzed in phase II. In phases I and II, there was no quantifiable transference of chlorhexidine to milk in untreated mammary gland quarters. Measurable chlorhexidine residues were found in milk from treated mammary gland quarters of 2 cows throughout the 42-day sample period in phase II. Estimated mean elimination half-life for chlorhexidine in milk was 11.5 days.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer saftey standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D.

Chlorhexidine diacetate is registered for current use in the U.S., but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. Currently, two end-use products with 2% chlorhexidine diacetate are registered for use as hard surface-treatment disinfectant/virucides. Chlorhexidine is used primarily as its salts e.g., the dihydrochloride, diacetate, and digluconate in disinfectants (disinfection of the skin and hands), cosmetics (additive to creams, toothpaste, deodorants, and antiperspirants), and pharmaceutical products (preservative in eyedrops, active substance in wound dressings and antiseptic mouthwashes). HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Chlorhexidine diacetate is highly acutely toxic when applied to the eye. Skin reactions to chlorhexidine-acetate and chlorhexidine-gluconate were tested among eczema patients. Positive reactions were found in 52 (5.4%) of the 1,063 subjects at the initial test. Of these subjects, 29 were retested, and 21 were still found to have positive reactions. Chlorhexidine specific IgE was detected only in Japanese individuals who had experienced anaphylactic type reactions and was not detected in Japanese nurses and patients or in a group of British nurses and hospital staff, all having regular contact with chlorhexidine. All chromogens plus chlorhexidine, but not chlorhexidine alone, produced some discoloration of hydroxyapatite and human teeth. A 67-yr-old man undergoing a colectomy for colon cancer was unintentionally administered 0.8 mg of chlorhexidine gluconate intravenously and subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Occupational asthma has been described in two health care workers, as a result of exposure to chlorhexidine and alcohol aerosols. Another case report describes six patients who developed urticaria, dyspnea, and anaphylactic shock due to topical application of chlorhexidine gluconate solution. Even very dilute solutions of chlorhexidine can cause marked chondrolysis of articular cartilage leading to severe permanent damage to the knee. ANIMAL STUDIES: Rabbits suffered severe ocular irritation with chlorhexidine acetate treatment. No dermal irritation was reported up to 72 hours following test article treatment in rabbits. In developmental studies no observable malformations or developmental toxicity were found at any dose level tested. Both positive and negative results have been seen in bacterial studies of the mutagenic effects of chlorhexidine; however, no mutagenic activity was seen in an in-vivo micronucleus assay or a mammalian cytogenic test using Chinese-hamster-ovary cells. No carcinogenic effects were seen in a long term animal study.",

Mothers had povidone-iodine applied either as a single application to 900 square cm for epidural anesthesia or 3 applications to the entire abdominal wall for cesarean section. Breastfed infants whose mothers had iodine overload had a greater risk for having elevated thyrotropin levels and requiring recall for retesting (3.2% with cesarean section and 2.7% with epidural anesthesia) compared to those who did not (0.1%). Bottle-fed infants were affected much less than breastfed infants. After replacing povidone-iodine with chlorhexidine 0.5% in 70% isopropanol for disinfection for 6 months, 1178 infants that were delivered at this institution had no increased rate of elevations in thyroid function tests and a reduced rate of recalls in breastfed infants.",

The other study used 120 mL of either 0.2% or 0.4% chlorhexidine solution as a vaginal lavage every 3 hours from admission to labor until delivery in 309 women. The average number of lavages was 2.1 (range 1 to 11). Chlorhexidine 0.25% swabs reduced MTCT in patients whose membranes ruptured more than 4 hours before delivery, but not in other women. Vaginal lavage showed a statistically nonsignificant trend towards reduction of MTCT, with the 0.4% greater than the 0.2%. Almost all of the infants in these studies were breastfed. No adverse events were reported in the infants, but follow-up related primarily to infant mortality and HIV status rather than effects of chlorhexidine.",

Although skin flora on the breasts of the treated mothers was reduced, there was no difference in the frequency of mastitis between the treated and placebo groups.

Severity of symptoms and signs, time for healing, and final visual acuity. Clinical results in four patients showed improved visual acuity, with a rapid recovery within 1 wk. No adverse drug reaction was encountered, but one patient with a perforated ulcer developed glaucoma. 83% of 6 eyes were medically cured with chlorhexidine and recovered visual acuity 6/18 or better. Four of five patients improved within 3 weeks, with resolution of infiltration and healing of epithelial defects. By 2 to 3 weeks, visual acuity 6/18 or better had improved in four (66.7%) of six eyes and recovered 6/6 in two eyes (33.3%). Bacterial coinfection occurred in one eye. Chlorhexidine dramatically hastened clinical improvement in all eyes and is a successful medical therapy that has excellent results in patients who are diagnosed early.",

The aim of this study was to establish whether there is a risk of sensitization and allergy to chlorhexidine from this type of exposure. Two hundred and forty-eight doctors, nurses and auxiliary staff were invited to participate in the study. One hundred and four individuals took part in the full study including skin tests and a questionnaire and a further 74 individuals filled in the questionnaire giving a total of 178 questionnaires (72%). Patch tests with chlorhexidine gluconate 1% and chlorhexidine acetate 1% were performed looking for type IV (delayed type) allergy. A prick test with chlorhexidine gluconate 0.5% and an intradermal test with chlorhexidine 0.0002% were performed looking for type I (immediate type) allergy.  There were no positive tests in any of the 104 individuals tested (99% confidence interval 0-4.9%). There was a predominance of females in both groups and the overall median age was 42 years (28-63). No one in the group not tested reported to have a verified or suspected allergy to chlorhexidine. This ...study to examine the risk of type I and type IV allergy to chlorhexidine in health care workers with daily exposure to chlorhexidine did not identify allergies to chlorhexidine in any of the 104 individuals tested or in the additional 74 individuals who completed the questionnaire.",

Chlorhexidine diacetate salt's use as a disinfectant to control bacteria on farms, egg handling and packaging equipment, meat and poultry processing plants, and certain viruses in veterinary settings may result in chlorhexidine's direct release to the environment. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.0X10-14 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chlorhexidine will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase chlorhexidine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Irradiation (lambda >290 nm) of chlorhexidine sorbed to silica gel resulted in 20% degradation after 17 hours. However, this chemical is expected to exist in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere and, therefore, photo-degradation is not expected to be an important fate process. If released to soil, chlorhexidine is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8.5X10+5. Values of pKa 7.63, 9.92, 8.22 and 10.52, indicate that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an cation and cations do not volatilize. Chlorhexidine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using the OECD Minimal test, chlorhexidine, present at 12 mg/L, achieved 0% degradation after 3 weeks in soil extract inoculum indicating that biodegradation is not expected to be an important fate process in soil. If released into water, chlorhexidine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Using the Closed Bottle test, chlorhexidine, present at 5.35 ppm, resulted in 0% COD after 28 days using an activated sludge inoculum, indicating that biodegradation is not expected to be an important fate process in water. The pKa values indicate chlorhexidine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to chlorhexidine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chlorhexidine is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to chlorhexidine via oral and dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Irradiation (lambda >290 nm) of chlorhexidine sorbed to silica gel resulted in 20% degradation after 17 hours(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

All cows were treated with chlorhexidine suspension by infusion into a mastitic mammary gland quarter after 2 milkings 24 hours apart. Foremilk samples (100 mL) were collected from treated and untreated (controls) mammary gland quarters of each cow. Chlorhexidine was extracted from raw milk, and residue concentrations were quantified by use of high-performance liquid chromatography. Foremilk samples from days 2, 5, and 8 were analyzed in phase I, and samples from time 0 and days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 were analyzed in phase II. RESULTS: In phases I and II, there was no quantifiable transference of chlorhexidine to milk in untreated mammary gland quarters. Measurable chlorhexidine residues were found in milk from treated mammary gland quarters of 2 cows throughout the 42-day sample period in phase II. Estimated mean elimination half-life for chlorhexidine in milk was 11.5 days. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: On the basis of the long elimination half-life of chlorhexidine in milk from treated mammary gland quarters, the lack of human dietary exposure data to suggest a food tolerance for chlorhexidine in food products, and the Food and Drug Administration's published zero tolerance for chlorhexidine in uncooked edible calf tissues, we do not recommend extralabel use of chlorhexidine suspension as a treatment to stop lactation in mastitic mammary gland quarters of cows.",

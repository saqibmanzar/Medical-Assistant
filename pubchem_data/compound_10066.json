PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Seven cyclodiene insecticides, gamma -hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma -BHC), beta -BHC, and hexachlorobenzene had no significant effect on the specific binding of ((3)H)Flu or ((3)H)muscimol.

All the 3 cyclodiene compounds inhibited both brain synaptosomal and heart sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-pump activity in vitro in a concentration dependent manner. Calmodulin depleted Ca2+-pump activity was insensitive to the action of toxic compounds. Oral administration of pesticides (0.5-10 mg/kg) to rats similarly decreased the Ca2+-pump activity, in addition to decreasing the levels of calmodulin of both brain and heart thus indicating disruption in membrane Ca2+ transport mechanisms. Exogenous addition of calmodulin (1-20 micrograms) could effectively reverse the pesticide induced inhibition. Ca2+-pump activity is more sensitive to the 3 cyclodiene compounds in brain than in heart. The results of the present study indicate that the cyclodiene compounds may produce neurotoxic effects by altering calmodulin regulated calcium dependent events in neurons. /Cyclodiene insecticides/",

Fourteen patients with convulsions caused by the insecticides all show specific anomalies in the electroencephalogram, consisting of bilateral synchronous theta wave activity and occasional bilateral synchronous spike and wave complexes believed to be associated with brain stem injury. A systematic survey of a large group of exposed workers reveals that the same specific wave form anomalies may occur without preceding or subsequent convulsions and even without any clinical symptoms or signs. Periodic electroencephalographic examination is suggested as a valuable method for the detection of early subclinical intoxication.",

Beef heart mitochondrial (oligomycin-sensitive) Mg(2+) ATPase activity was inhibited by all chemicals at all concentrations tested. Aldrin was the most potent inhibitor with IC50 of 40 um; about 30% was observed with dieldrin and inhibition was not concentration-dependent. Rat brain synaptosomal ATPases were most sensitive to aldrin and telodrin. A 50% inhibition of oligomycin-sensitive Mg(2+) ATPase activity was obtained at 80 umolar air of aldrin. Na + K+ ATPase and oligomycin-insensitive Mg(2+) ATPase activities showed max inhibition of 40% at highest concentration tested for aldrin.

The increase in toxicity is very significant in the case of the amphipod,Gammarus (1.5-12 times), bluegill fry (3.6-5.7 times), mosquito larvae,Aedas (2.3-6 times), minnow fry (2.5 times), and the isopid,Asellus (2 times). Photodieldrin is 12 and 5 times more toxic than dieldrin, respectively, to Gammarus, and to blue-gill fry, photoaldrin is 6 and 4 times more toxic than aldrin, respectively, to mosquito larvae and bluegill fry. The toxicities of the photoisomers of isodrin and chlordene are generally less than those of their parent compounds",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.4X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isodrin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase isodrin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.2 days. Particulate-phase isodrin may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition. Isodrin will undergo phototransformation when irradiated with natural sunlight. If released to soil, isodrin is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.1X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.9X10-4 atm-cu m/mole; however, in soils with organic carbon, volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to soil solids as indicated by an estimated Koc of 1.1X10+5. Isodrin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, isodrin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9.9 hours and 8.9 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 4.6 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 3.1X10+4 suggests the potential bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hyrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to isodrin may have occurred occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isodrin was produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to isodrin via ingestion of fish and dermal contact with this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.9X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9.9 hours and 8.9 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 4.6 years if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 2.1X10+4(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 6.75(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC 2006).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 0.2 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals/cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of isodrin with ozone has been estimated as 20X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 0.057 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules/cu cm(2). Isodrin is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Isodrin will undergo phototransformation when irradiated with natural sunlight(4-6). The yields and products may vary with the wavelength of the light, the irradiation period and the physical state of the irradiated material(4). Photoisodrin is a phototransformation product of isodrin(4,6). Rotenone may act as a sensitizer to accelerate the photoalteration of isodrin adsorbed onto solid surfaces(5). Irradiation of aldrin, dieldrin, and isodrin in the presence of the photosensitizer, benzophenone, afforded the respective photoisomers in yields of 58-90%(6). The data suggest that photoisodrin was formed via the triplet state(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that isodrin is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 9.9 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 8.9 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water and moist soil surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 4.6 years when adsorption is considered(3). Isodrin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a an estimated vapor pressure of 4.4X10-5 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3).",

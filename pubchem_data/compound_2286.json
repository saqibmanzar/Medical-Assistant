The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.1X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bisphenol A diglycidyl ether will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase bisphenol A diglycidyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.8 hrs. Particulate-phase bisphenol A diglycidyl ether will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. If released to soil, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,800. Biodegradation data were not available. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 180 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Epoxides in general hydrolyze rapidly at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7 through neutral, acid, or base-mediated reactions. Occupational exposure to bisphenol A diglycidyl ether may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bisphenol A diglycidyl ether is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to bisphenol A diglycidyl ether via dermal contact with this compound and other products containing bisphenol A diglycidyl ether. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 180(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 3.8(6) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Epoxides in general hydrolyze rapidly at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7(7) through neutral, acid, or base-mediated reactions(8). Hydrolysis products are usually the corresponding diol and sometimes re-arranged products(8). While data specific to bisphenol A diglycidyl ether were not located(SRC, 2006), the hydrolysis half-life for an analogous compound glycidyl alcohol is 28 days at pH 7(7). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2006).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5.8 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Glycidyl ethers, such as bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, can react readily with water and with nucleophiles such as proteins and nucleic acids(2). Epoxides in general hydrolyze rapidly at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7(3) through neutral, acid, or base-mediated reactions(4). Hydrolysis products are usually the corresponding diol and sometimes re-arranged products(4). While data specific to bisphenol A diglycidyl ether were not located(SRC, 2006), the hydrolysis half-life for an analogous compound glycidyl alcohol is 28 days at pH 7(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

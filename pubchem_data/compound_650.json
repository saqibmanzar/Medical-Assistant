PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Bronchiolitis obliterans is generally not diagnosed until irreversible damage has occurred; therefore a biomarker of early exposure is needed. The potential systemic uptake of BD from inhalation exposure has not been evaluated. The objective here was to evaluate the systemic exposure of BD and binding to hemoglobin and albumin. [(14)C]BD was administered to male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (100 mg/kg, intratracheal instillation) and B6C3F1/N mice (157 mg/kg, oropharyngeal aspiration). Blood and plasma was collected 24 hr after administration and analyzed for (14)C content. At 24 hr, 0.88 +/- 0.07% of the administered dose was in rat blood, 0.66 +/- 0.06% in rat plasma, 0.38 +/- 0.13% in mouse blood and 0.17 +/- 0.05% in mouse plasma. Albumin binding in rats was 269 +/- 24.2 ng equiv./mg, which accounts for 38% of the radioactivity in plasma. In mice, binding was 85.0 +/- 22.3 ng equiv./mg albumin, which accounts for 51% of the radioactivity in plasma. The binding to hemoglobin in rats was 38.2 +/- 17.6 ng equiv./mg, and to globin was 29.1 +/- 3.96 ng equiv./mg. In mice, the binding to hemoglobin was 16.2 +/- 9.0 ng equiv./mg. The site(s) of adduction on hemoglobin and albumin was investigated by mass spectrometry. In rat globin, arginine adducts were detected at R-30 and R-104 of the beta chain in vitro and in vivo. In rat albumin, adducts were detected in vitro on R-219/221, R-360, and R-368, and in vivo on a variety of arginine residues. This study demonstrated that BD enters the systemic circulation and reacts with arginine on hemoglobin and albumin. These results indicate that hemoglobin and albumin adducts may be useful as biomarkers of BD exposure in humans.",

The goal of this study was to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for inspired vapor dosimetry and to apply the model to diacetyl. The respiratory tract was modeled as a series of airways: nose, trachea, main bronchi, large bronchi, small bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli with tissue dimensions obtained from the literature. Airborne vapor was allowed to absorb (or desorb) from tissues based on mass transfer coefficients. Transfer of vapor within tissues was based on molecular diffusivity with direct reaction with tissue substrates and/or metabolism being allowed in each tissue compartment. In vitro studies were performed to provide measures of diacetyl metabolism kinetics and direct reaction rates allowing for the development of a model with no unassigned variables. Respiratory tract uptake of halothane, acetone, ethanol and diacetyl was measured in male F344 rat to obtain data for model validation. The human model was validated against published values for inspired vapor uptake. For both the human and rat models, a close concordance of model estimates with experimental measurements was observed, validating the model. The model estimates that limited amounts of inspired diacetyl penetrate to the bronchioles of the rat (<2%), whereas in the lightly exercising human, 24% penetration to the bronchioles is estimated. Bronchiolar tissue concentrations of diacetyl in the human are estimated to exceed those in the rat by 40-fold. These inhalation dosimetric differences may contribute to the human-rat differences in diacetyl-induced airway injury.",

Diacetyl and acetoin were reduced to 2,3-butanediol in these experiments, but acetoin and 2,3-butanediol were scarcely oxidized to diacetyl, indicating that the reduction reaction to 2,3-butanediol from diacetyl occurs actively in rat liver. The formation of acetoin from diacetyl required either NADH or NADPH as a reductant, while the reduction of acetoin to 2,3-butanediol required NADH. Acetoin and 2,3-butanediol were more readily accumulated than diacetyl in brain tissue.",

In lager beer, they are responsible for off-flavors (buttery flavor) and therefore their presence and quantification is of paramount importance to beer producers. Aiming at developing an accurate quantitative monitoring scheme to follow these off-flavor compounds during beer production and in the final product, the head space solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) analytical procedure was tuned through experiments planned in an optimal way and the final settings were fully validated. Optimal design of experiments (O-DOE) is a computational, statistically-oriented approach for designing experiences that are most informative according to a well-defined criterion. This methodology was applied for HS-SPME optimization, leading to the following optimal extraction conditions for the quantification of VDK: use a CAR/PDMS fiber, 5 mL of samples in 20 mL vial, 5 min of pre-incubation time followed by 25 min of extraction at 30 \u00b0C, with agitation. The validation of the final analytical methodology was performed using a matrix-matched calibration, in order to minimize matrix effects. The following key features were obtained: linearity (R(2) > 0.999, both for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione), high sensitivity (LOD of 0.92 ug/L and 2.80 ug/L, and LOQ of 3.30 ug/L and 10.01 ug/L, for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, respectively), recoveries of approximately 100% and suitable precision (repeatability and reproducibility lower than 3% and 7.5%, respectively). The applicability of the methodology was fully confirmed through an independent analysis of several beer samples, with analyte concentrations ranging from 4 to 200 g/L.",

As part of ongoing investigations into airways disease in microwave popcorn workers, NIOSH has recently undertaken animal experiments to evaluate individual butter flavoring chemicals. Results of an animal study indicate that exposure to vapors from diacetyl, a chemical used to impart butter-like flavor, causes airway injury, though perhaps to a smaller extent than that caused by exposure to vapors from the intact butter flavoring mixture itself. [Reference #1] In the original 8 cases, there was no history of acute toxic exposure as is typical for other causes of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). The disease developed over a longer period of time. [Reference #2] BO also reported in two flavor-manufacturing workers in California; [MMWR 2007 Apr 27;56(16): 389-93] Exposure to high concentrations (>190 ppm) of diacetyl-containing butter flavor and to pure diacetyl resulted in necrosis of nasal and airway epithelium in rats exposed in a whole-body inhalation chamber for 6 hr. . . . Our data suggest that diacetyl levels in small- to medium-sized flavor manufacturing facilities are widely variable, ranging from the limit of detection (<0.01 ppm) to as high as 60 ppm, with a mean of 1.80 ppm and a median of 0.10 ppm. These ranges are lower than those reported in the microwave popcorn plant with the index cases of BO, where diacetyl levels ranged from less that 0.01 ppm to 98 ppm, with a mean of 8.1 ppm. [PMID 18720288] In 6-hour inhalation studies of rats, causes changes to trachea or bronchi at concentrations >294 ppm; In oral lethal-dose studies, causes ataxia and coma in guinea pigs and somnolence in rats;  [RTECS] See Airway obstruction related to diacetyl exposure at microwave popcorn production facilities. [PMID 19567602] TLV Basis = lung damage (bronchiolitis obliterans-like illness); Animal data suggest the respiratory tract is the primary target of diacetyl exposure, similar to humans, although, in rats this tends to be the upper airways rather than the lower airways (bronchioles). Adverse health effects also seem to occur at higher levels of exposure than in humans. Diacetyl has notations of DSEN and A3. [ACGIH] DA exposures, often exceeding 1 ppm in the past, place workers at high risk of pulmonary impairment. [PMID 29443707] Danger of skin sensitization; [MAK] See 2,3-Pentanedione.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

In August 2004, the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) and Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) received the first report of a bronchiolitis obliterans diagnosis in a flavor-manufacturing worker in California. In April 2006, a second report was received of a case in a flavor-manufacturing worker from another company. Neither worker was employed in the microwave-popcorn industry; both were workers in the flavor-manufacturing industry, which produces artificial butter flavoring and other flavors such as cherry, almond, praline, jalapeno, and orange. Both workers had handled pure diacetyl, an ingredient in artificial butter and other flavorings, and additional chemicals involved in the manufacturing process. Studies have indicated that exposure to diacetyl causes severe respiratory epithelial injury in animals. Because the manufacture of flavorings involves more than 2,000 chemicals, workers in the general flavor-manufacturing industry are exposed to more chemicals than workers in the microwave-popcorn industry, which primarily uses butter flavorings. ... This report describes the first two cases of bronchiolitis obliterans in flavor-manufacturing workers in California, the findings of the public health investigation, and the actions taken by state and federal agencies to prevent future cases of occupational bronchiolitis obliterans. ..."

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Diacetyl is a diketone flavoring agent that is commonly employed for buttery taste as well as other purposes. Industrial exposure to flavoring agents, particularly diacetyl, has recently been associated with bronchiolitis obliterans, a severe respiratory illness producing fibrosis and obstruction of the small airways. This has been most commonly reported in the microwave popcorn production industry, but it has occurred elsewhere. In addition to bronchiolitis obliterans, spirometry abnormalities (fixed airflow obstruction) and respiratory symptoms have been associated with exposure. A direct effect on the respiratory epithelium with the disorganized fibrotic repair appears most likely as the underlying mechanism. Current data suggest that diacetyl is the agent responsible, although it is possible that diacetyl is simply a marker for another causative agent. Workers at the microwave popcorn company experienced normal rates of all-cause mortality but higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-associated mortality, especially workers employed before the company reduced diacetyl exposure. According to case reports, lung disease could also arise in the consumers of diacetyl-containing popcorn. ANIMAL STUDIES: Male mice were exposed by inhalation to 200 or 400 ppm DA 6 hr/day for 5 days. 400 ppm caused deaths and acute necrotizing rhinitis, laryngitis and bronchitis (proximal large bronchi). Exposure to 200 ppm caused a few deaths and acute necrotizing rhinitis and erosive or necrotizing laryngitis in all mice. There were no lung or bronchiolar lesions in the DA exposed mice. Chronic bronchitis, laryngitis, and rhinitis were present after 2 and 4 weeks of exposure. In rats diacetyl inhalation increases substance P levels in sensory nerves of airway epithelium. Because substance P release in airways promotes inflammation and activation of sensory nerves mediates reflexes, neural changes may contribute to flavorings-related lung disease pathogenesis. When given i.p. to mice once weekly for 24 weeks, diacetyl (1.70 or 8.40 mg/kg [0.0197 or 0.0976 mmol/kg]) did not induce any lung tumors. Groups of hamsters, mice, and rats were given a solution containing 90% diacetyl by gavage on days 6-10 of gestation for hamsters and days 6-15 of gestation for mice and rats. The doses for all species were 16, 74, 345, or 1600 mg/kg bw per day. No effects were seen on maternal survival, weight, or reproductive parameters or on fetal survival or microscopic appearance of external, skeletal, or soft tissues. Diacetyl induced mitotic chromosome loss in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of propionitrile. In several bacterial assays, diacetyl generally showed mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, 102, and 104 with and without metabolic activation but none against strain TA98. Conflicting results were obtained in Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvra, but nonmutagenicity was demonstrated in the SOS-chromotest using E. coli PQ37. Diacetyl was also negative in a micronucleus test using mouse bone marrow cells.",

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

In rats, inhalation of diacetyl, a major component of butter flavoring, and inhalation of a diacetyl substitute, 2,3-pentanedione, produce similar damage to airway epithelium. The effects of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione and mixtures of diacetyl, acetic acid, and acetoin, all components of butter flavoring, on pulmonary function and airway reactivity to methacholine (MCh) were investigated. Lung resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were negligibly changed 18 hr after a 6-hr inhalation exposure to diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione (100-360 ppm). Reactivity to MCh was not markedly changed after diacetyl, but was modestly decreased after 2,3-pentanedione inhalation. Inhaled diacetyl exerted essentially no effect on reactivity to mucosally applied MCh, but 2,3-pentanedione (320 and 360 ppm) increased reactivity to MCh in the isolated, perfused trachea preparation (IPT). In IPT, diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione (>/= 3 mM) applied to the serosal and mucosal surfaces of intact and epithelium-denuded tracheas initiated transient contractions followed by relaxations. Inhaled acetoin (150 ppm) exerted no effect on pulmonary function and airway reactivity in vivo; acetic acid (27 ppm) produced hyperreactivity to MCh; and exposure to diacetyl + acetoin + acetic acid (250 + 150 + 27 ppm) led to a diacetyl-like reduction in reactivity. Data suggest that the effects of 2,3-pentanedione on airway reactivity are greater than those of diacetyl, and that flavorings are airway smooth muscle relaxants and constrictors, thus indicating a complex mechanism.",

Some of these strains are able to survive and produce reuterin in cheese and yogurt when added as adjuncts to the starter. Similarly, in fermented dairy foods, other inhibitory compounds such as lactic acid and diacetyl are produced during fermentation. In this work, we studied the combined effect of reuterin and diacetyl under different pH conditions against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enteritidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. Results from agar spot assays showed that the antimicrobial activity of reuterin-producing strains against the gram-negative bacteria tested was enhanced as the concentration of diacetyl increased to 50 mg/kg, and was higher under acidic conditions (pH 5.0) for the 3 pathogenic strains. The combination of reuterin and diacetyl had an additive effect against L. monocytogenes only at diacetyl concentrations of 50 mg/kg and pH 5.0. In addition, growth kinetics studies showed that the combination of 1 activity unit (AU)/mL of reuterin with 100mg/kg diacetyl increased the lag time of the 3 pathogens. In milk, synergistic antimicrobial activity was observed with the combination of 1 AU/mL reuterin and 50 or 100 mg/kg of diacetyl on the gram-negative strains tested, and with 1 AU/mL reuterin and 100 mg/kg of diacetyl on L. monocytogenes. The greatest inhibition of the 3 pathogens was achieved in acidified milk at pH 5.0 with reuterin (1 AU/mL) and diacetyl (100 mg/kg). Based on these results, the combination of reuterin and diacetyl in acidified dairy products could be a promising strategy to control food pathogens in these products.",

Industrial exposure to flavoring agents, particularly diacetyl, has recently been associated with bronchiolitis obliterans, a severe respiratory illness producing fibrosis and obstruction of the small airways. This has been most commonly reported in the microwave popcorn production industry, but it has occurred elsewhere. In addition to bronchiolitis obliterans, spirometry abnormalities (fixed airflow obstruction) and respiratory symptoms have been associated with exposure. A direct effect on the respiratory epithelium with the disorganized fibrotic repair appears most likely as the underlying mechanism. Current data suggest that diacetyl is the agent responsible, although it is possible that diacetyl is simply a marker for another causative agent."

We review data relating to consumer exposures, estimate case exposures, and compare them to diacetyl-containing flavoring-exposed manufacturing workers with lung disease. These consumer cases' exposure levels are comparable to those that caused disease in workers. We were unable to identify any other exposures or diseases known or suspected to cause BO in these cases. BFMP poses a significant respiratory risk to consumers. Some manufacturers have substituted diacetyl with other alpha-diketones that are likely to pose a similar risk.

Excess rates of lung-function abnormalities were related to cumulative diacetyl exposure. Because information on potential excess mortality would support development of permissible exposure limits for diacetyl, we investigated respiratory-associated mortality during 2000-2011 among current and former workers at this company who had exposure to flavorings and participated in cross-sectional surveys conducted between 2000-2003. We ascertained workers' vital status through a Social Security Administration search. Causes of death were abstracted from death certificates. Because bronchiolitis obliterans is not coded in the International Classification of Disease 10th revision (ICD-10), we identified respiratory mortality decedents with ICD-10 codes J40-J44 which encompass bronchitis (J40), simple and mucopurulent chronic bronchitis (J41), unspecified chronic bronchitis (J42), emphysema (J43), and other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (J44). We calculated expected number of deaths and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to determine if workers exposed to diacetyl experienced greater respiratory mortality than expected. We identified 15 deaths among 511 workers. Based on U.S. population estimates, 17.39 deaths were expected among these workers (SMR=0.86; CI:0.48-1.42). Causes of death were available for 14 decedents. Four deaths among production and flavor mixing workers were documented to have a multiple cause of 'other COPD' (J44), while 0.98 'other COPD'-associated deaths were expected (SMR=4.10; CI:1.12-10.49). Three of the 4 'other COPD'-associated deaths occurred among former workers and workers employed before the company implemented interventions reducing diacetyl exposure in 2001. Workers at the microwave popcorn company experienced normal rates of all-cause mortality but higher rates of COPD-associated mortality, especially workers employed before the company reduced diacetyl exposure."

Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed by inhalation to 200 or 400 ppm DA 6 hr/day for 5 days. 400 ppm caused deaths and acute necrotizing rhinitis, laryngitis and bronchitis (proximal large bronchi). Exposure to 200 ppm caused a few deaths and acute necrotizing rhinitis and erosive or necrotizing laryngitis in all mice. There were no lung or bronchiolar lesions in the DA exposed mice. To reduce the nasal cavity toxicity the daily exposure duration was reduced to 1 hr/day, 5 days/week and the study duration increased to 4 weeks (100, 200, 400 ppm). Chronic bronchitis, laryngitis, and rhinitis were present after 2 and 4 weeks of exposure. The lesion severity was concentration related and ranged from minimal to moderate. Because of the sensitivity of the nasal cavity to inhaled DA, mice (5/group) were administered 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg DA by oropharyngeal aspiration. Two mice in the 400 mg/kg group died 2 days after aspiration. On day 4 after aspiration of 400 mg/kg, foci of fibrosis without inflammation were present at the junction of the terminal bronchiole and alveolar duct in all 3 remaining mice. Similar lesions with mild inflammation were noted in 1/5 mice treated with 200 mg/kg. Although the histological appearance of these lesions is not identical to OB these lesions may progress to OB with continued exposure. In addition to longer exposure durations other DA exposure routes and exposure regimens are being evaluated."

This study examines diacetyl-induced changes in sensory nerves of tracheal epithelium. Rats (n = 6/group) inhaled 0-, 25-, 249-, or 346-ppm diacetyl for 6 hr. Tracheas and vagal ganglia were removed 1-day postexposure and labeled for substance P (SP) or protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5). Vagal ganglia neurons projecting to airway epithelium were identified by axonal transport of fluorescent microspheres intratracheally instilled 14 days before diacetyl inhalation. End points were SP and PGP9.5 nerve fiber density (NFD) in tracheal epithelium and SP-positive neurons projecting to the trachea. PGP9.5-immunoreactive NFD decreased in foci with denuded epithelium, suggesting loss of airway sensory innervation. However, in the intact epithelium adjacent to denuded foci, SP-immunoreactive NFD increased from 0.01 +/- 0.002 in controls to 0.05 +/- 0.01 after exposure to 346-ppm diacetyl. In vagal ganglia, SP-positive airway neurons increased from 3.3 +/- 3.0% in controls to 25.5 +/- 6.6% after inhaling 346-ppm diacetyl. Thus, diacetyl inhalation increases SP levels in sensory nerves of airway epithelium. Because SP release in airways promotes inflammation and activation of sensory nerves mediates reflexes, neural changes may contribute to flavorings-related lung disease pathogenesis.",

Computational fluid dynamic physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling was coupled with biomarker assessment to establish delivered dose-response relationships in RTM and TBM in male F344 rats following 6 hr exposure to diacetyl or acrolein. Biomarkers included glutathione status, proinflammatory and antioxidant gene mRNA levels, and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). Modeling revealed that 0.0094-0.1653 ug acrolein/min-sq cm and 3.9-21.6 ug diacetyl/min-sq cm were deposited into RTM/TBM. Results indicate RTM and TBM were generally of similar sensitivity to diacetyl and acrolein. For instance, both tissues displayed induction of antioxidant and proinflammatory genes, and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 after electrophile exposure. Hierarchical cellular response patterns were similar in RTM and TBM but differed between vapors. Specifically, diacetyl exposure induced proinflammatory and antioxidant genes concomitantly at low exposure levels, whereas acrolein induced antioxidant genes at much lower exposure levels than that required to induce proinflammatory genes. Generally, diacetyl was less potent than acrolein, as measured by maximal induction of transcripts. In conclusion, the upper and lower extrapulmonary airways are of similar sensitivity to inhaled electrophilic vapors. Dosimetrically based extrapolation of nasal responses in nose-breathing rodents may provide an approach to predict risk to the lower airways of humans during mouth-breathing.",

Rats were exposed for 6 hr by inhalation and were necropsied 1 day after exposure. The exposure was found by GC-MS analysis to be a complex mixture of various organic gases with the major peaks consisting of diacetyl (2,3-butanedione), acetic acid, acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone), butyric acid, acetoin dimers, 2-nonanone, and delta-alkyl lactones. Diacetyl was used as a marker of exposure concentration. In the lung, butter flavoring vapors containing 285-371 ppm diacetyl caused multifocal, necrotizing bronchitis, which was most consistently present in the mainstem bronchus. Alveoli were unaffected. Butter flavoring vapors containing 203-371 ppm diacetyl caused necrosuppurative rhinitis, which affected all four levels of the nose. Within the posterior two nasal levels (T3 and T4), necrosis and inflammation was principally localized to the nasopharyngeal duct. Control rats were unaffected. Therefore, concentrations of butter flavoring vapors that can occur during the manufacture of foods are associated with epithelial injury in the nasal passages and pulmonary airways of rats.",

Diacetyl is found in butter, bay oil and other oils; plant volatiles, forest fires, animal wastes; tree ripened whole nectarine; kiwi fruit flower; and as a natural product of fermentation. Diacetyl has been identified as a component of tobacco smoke. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 56.8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diacetyl will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diacetyl will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 67 days. Diacetyl contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. The direct photolysis half-life of diacetyl in the atmosphere has been reported at 0.7 hr. If released to soil, diacetyl is expected to have very high mobility based upon a estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.33X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Diacetyl may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A bacterium that was isolated from Amsterdam harbor water using 2-butanol and tentatively identified as a Pseudomonas was able to degrade diacetyl. Diacetyl was identified as an intermediate in the microbial oxidation of 2-butanol. Since 2-butanol is biodegradable using river water or sewage inoculums with extensive mineralization, biodegradation of diactyl may be an environmental process in soil and water. If released into water, diacetyl is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.7 days and 22 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to diacetyl may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diacetyl is produced or used; inhalation of diacetyl has been shown to cause respiratory problems in microwave popcorn plant workers. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to diacetyl via inhalation of butter flavoring vapors, ingestion of food and drinking water, the use of tobacco products and e-cigarettes, and dermal contact with this compound products containing diacetyl.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Flavoring chemicals gained notoriety in the early 2000s when inhalation exposure of the flavoring chemical diacetyl was found to be associated with a disease that became known as \"popcorn lung.\" There has been limited research on flavoring chemicals in e-cigarettes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine if the flavoring chemical diacetyl and two other high-priority flavoring chemicals, 2,3-pentanedione and acetoin, are present in a convenience sample of flavored e-cigarettes. METHODS: We selected 51 types of flavored e-cigarettes sold by leading e-cigarette brands and flavors we deemed were appealing to youth. E-cigarette contents were fully discharged and the air stream was captured and analyzed for total mass of diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and acetoin, according to OSHA method 1012. RESULTS: At least one flavoring chemical was detected in 47 of 51 unique flavors tested. Diacetyl was detected above the laboratory limit of detection in 39 of the 51 flavors tested, ranging from below the limit of quantification to 239 ug/e-cigarette. 2,3-Pentanedione and acetoin were detected in 23 and 46 of the 51 flavors tested at concentrations up to 64 and 529 ug/e-cigarette, respectively. CONCLUSION: Because of the associations between diacetyl and bronchiolitis obliterans and other severe respiratory diseases observed in workers, urgent action is recommended to further evaluate this potentially widespread exposure via flavored e-cigarettes.",

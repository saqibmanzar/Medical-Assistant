PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Nine male volunteers were experimentally exposed to 500 ppm HFC-143a for 2 hr during light physical exercise (50W) in an exposure chamber. Blood, urine and exhaled air were sampled before, during and up to 19 hr after exposure and analyzed for HFC-143a by gas chromatography. These data were described by a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model. The electrocardiograms of the volunteers were monitored during exposure. Before, during and after exposure the volunteers rated symptoms related to irritation and CNS-symptoms on a visual analogue scale. Inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A protein, D-dimer, fibrinogen) and uric acid were analyzed in plasma collected before and 21 hr after exposure. The exposures were performed after informed consent and ethical approval. The plasma concentration of HFC-143a increased promptly at start of exposure, and decreased in the same manner post-exposure. A stable level of 4.8+/-2.0 microM (mean+/-S.D.) was reached within 30 min of exposure. The HFC-143a concentration in plasma and exhaled air decreased fast and in parallel when exposure was stopped. The urinary excretion of HFC-143a after exposure was 0.0007% of the inhaled amount. The half-time in urine, calculated from pooled data, was 53 min. The experimental and simulated time courses in blood and exhaled air were in agreement. The simulated relative uptake during the exposure was 1.6+/-0.3%. The fibrinogen level in plasma had increased by 11% 1 day post-exposure. No statistically significant increase was seen for the other inflammatory markers or for uric acid. No effects of exposure were seen either in the electrocardiographic monitorings or as symptom ratings on the visual analogue scale.",

The objective of this study was to examine the usefulness of blood and breath for exposure biomonitoring of HFCs. We compared data on blood and exhaled air from a series of experiments where healthy volunteers were exposed to vapors of four commonly used HFCs; 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane. All four HFCs had similar toxicokinetic profiles in blood with a rapid initial increase and an apparent steady-state reached within a few minutes. For all HFCs, the inhalation uptake during exposure was low (less than 6%), most of which was exhaled post-exposure. No metabolism could be detected and only minor amounts were excreted unchanged in urine. The observed time courses in blood and breath were well described by physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. Simulations of 8-hr exposures show that the HFC levels in both blood and breath drop rapidly during the first minutes post-exposure, whereafter the decline is considerably slower and mainly reflects washout from fat tissues. We conclude that blood and exhaled air can be used for biological exposure monitoring. Samples should not be taken immediately at the end of shift but rather 20-30 min later.",

Both liquid-phase halogen exchange in the presence of catalysts, such as antimony(V) or tin(IV) chlorofluorides and vapor phase reactions using solid-phase catalysts based on chromium are employed. Preferred starting materials are chloroform for HFC 23, dichloromethane for HFC 32, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane for HFC 143a. The conversion of tetrachloroethylene to HFC 125 and trichloroethylene to HFC 134a involves initial HF-addition across the double bond followed by a series of chlorine-fluorine exchange reactions.",

Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket.

Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. CAUTION: For LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972), DO NOT apply water, regular or alcohol-resistant foam directly on spill. Use a high-expansion foam if available to reduce vapors. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2024)",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used to make other chemicals and may be used as a refrigerant. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: There was no significant increase in chromosome aberrations when human lymphocytes were exposed to the substance in vitro. ANIMAL STUDIES: HFC-143a has a very low acute inhalation toxicity potential as shown by a 4-hr LC50 of > 540,000 ppm in rats. HFC-143A has a low potential to induce cardiac sensitization in experimental screening studies in dogs; only the highest concentration tested--300,000 ppm--elicited a cardiac sensitization response. In one study, a 3% solution of 1,1,1-trifluoroethane in corn oil was given to rats by gavage in doses of 300 mg/kg body weight, 5 days/week for 52 weeks. The animals were killed on week 125. Males had significantly lower body weights from week 28 to week 88. No other exposure-related effects were observed: there was no significant increase of cancer incidence in any organ. One study reports that 1,1,1-trifluoroethane had mutagenic effects on two of four strains of Salmonella typhimurium when tested in vitro, both with and without metabolic activation. Another study reports that mutagenic effects could not be observed when the substance was tested, either with or without addition of metabolizing systems, on a total of six strains of Salmonella typhimurium and two strains of E coli. In cell transformation tests on mammalian cells in vitro, 1,1,1- trifluoroethane had no observed mutagenic effect. Further, there was no significant increase of micronuclei in bone marrow cells of mice that had been exposed to 40,000, 10,000 or 2000 ppm 1,1,1-trifluoroethane 6 hours/day for two days. No maternal or developmental toxicity was noted after exposure to HFC-143a even at 40,000 ppm in rats or rabbits. No evidence of teratogenicity was noted in rats or rabbits.",

Females showed no evidence of toxicity at any exposure level; male rats did exhibit degenerative changes only in the tests at all exposure levels. However, because of exposure system irregularities, which resulted in excessive temperature conditions and stress in the HFC-143a-exposed groups, the study was repeated in male rats exposed by whole-body inhalation. In this repeat study no toxicity was observed at < or = 40,000 ppm. Moreover, a subsequent 90-day whole-body inhalation study in rats exposed 6 hr/day, 5 days/week at 0, 2000, 10,000, or 40,000 ppm resulted in no evidence of toxicity at any exposure concentration. The results of the second 4-week and the 90-day studies using whole-body exposures indicate that the findings from the first 4-week study were related to the stress induced by excessive temperatures and nose-only restraint. Therefore, the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for rats repeatedly exposed up to 90 days was considered to be 40,000 ppm.",

Because of the unusually low control incidence of variations (1.6% per litter in the control versus 6.8-16.8% for historical control values), the lack of a clear dose-response relationship, and the lack of other developmental effects, these findings were not considered related to HFC-143a exposure. ...",

When released into the environment, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane is expected to volatilize almost entirely into the atmosphere. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9465 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1,1-trifluoroethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase 1,1,1-trifluoroethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 36 years. 1,1,1-Trifluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. It is not an ozone-depleting compound, but it is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. The 100-year Global Warming Potential of 1,1,1-trifluoroethane has been estimated as 3800. If released to soil, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 44. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.77 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1,1-Trifluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Based on the analog data for 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b), 1,1,1-trifluoroethane is considered to be not readily biodegradable. If released into water, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.7 hours and 3.6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 6.5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,1,1-trifluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1,1-trifluoroethane is produced or used. Consumer exposure to 1,1,1-trifluoroethane is considered to be negligible. Environmental exposure through air is possible but will be very low/considered negligible. However, atmospheric release from uses in air conditioning and refrigeration systems may result in inhalation exposure. (SRC)",

Gas-phase 1,1,1-trifluoroethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 36 years(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.20X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). When released into the environment, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane is expected to volatilize almost entirely into the atmosphere, where it will be slowly degraded via trifluoroacetaldehyde to HF and CO2 as final products(4). 1,1,1-Trifluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). 1,1,1-Trifluoroethane has no effect on stratospheric ozone depletion(6). The 100-year global warming potential of 1,1,1-trifluoroethane has been estimated as 3800 (compared with 1 for CO2) and the atmospheric lifetime has been estimated as 48.3 years(6).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 36 years at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). A photochemical trajectory model has calculated a photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) of 0.0 for 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, thus 1,1,1-trifluoroethane should make a negligible contribution to photochemical ozone production(3). Due to the absence of chlorine and bromine atoms, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane has no effect on stratospheric ozone depletion(3). The 100-year global warming potential of 1,1,1-trifluoroethane has been estimated as 3800 (compared with 1 for CO2) and the atmospheric lifetime has been estimated as 48.3 years(3). The slow degradation in the atmosphere is reported to proceed via production of trifluoroacetaldehyde to HF and CO2 as final products(4). 1,1,1-Trifluoroethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). 1,1,1-Trifluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 1,1,1-trifluoroethane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 2.7 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 3.6 days(SRC). 1,1,1-Trifluoroethane's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 1,1,1-Trifluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 9465 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(3). The water-air partition coefficient of 1,1,1-trifluoroethane in saline solution under physiologically based conditions was measured as 0.15(4) which corresponds to a Henry's Law constant of about 0.2 atm-cu m/mole(SRC).",

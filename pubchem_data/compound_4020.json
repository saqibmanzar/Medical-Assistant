It is a tricyclic anorexigenic agent unrelated to and less toxic than amphetamine, but with some similar side effects. It inhibits uptake of catecholamines and blocks the binding of cocaine to the dopamine uptake transporter. Although the mechanism of action of the sympathomimetics in the treatment of obesity is not fully known, these medications have pharmacological effects similar to those of amphetamines. Unlike other sympathomimetic appetite suppressants such as phentermine, mazindol is thought to inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine rather than to cause its release.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Results in animal studies show that mazindol exerts its effects primarily on the septal area of the brain, specifically the limbic system.

Studies on the regional distribution of these binding sites revealed that the hypothalamus and brainstem had the highest density of sites. Kinetic analysis of the binding of (3)H mazindol to hypothalamic membranes demonstrated a single class of noninteracting binding sites with an apparent affinity constant (KD) of 10.2 +/- 0.7 microM and maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) of 786 + or - 94 pmol/mg of protein. Specific (3)H mazindol binding was rapidly reversible, temperature sensitive, labile to pretreatment with proteolytic enzymes, and inhibited by physiological concn of sodium. In most peripheral tissues, such as the liver and kidney, very low levels of binding were observed; however, the adrenal gland had a relatively high density of sites. The potency of a series of anorectic drugs in inhibiting specific (3)H mazindol binding to hypothalamic membranes was highly correlated with their anorectic potencies in rats, but not with their motor stimulatory effects. These results suggest the presence of a specific drug recognition site in the hypothalamus that may mediate the anorectic activity of mazindol and related phenylethylamines.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

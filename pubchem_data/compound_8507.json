When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The determination of the sentinel lymph node allows the physician to stage cancer by observing if cancer has spread to the near lymph nodes."

Acid Blue 1's production and use as a dye, a biological stain and to color medicinal products may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. The ionic state of C.I. Acid Blue 1 makes this compound essentially non-volatile, therefore C.I. Acid Blue 1 should exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase C.I. Acid Blue 1 may be physically removed from the air, mainly by wet deposition. An estimated Koc of 15 suggests that C.I. Acid Blue 1 will have very high mobility in soil although its ionic nature may result in ion-exchange processes with clay that would retard leaching. The volatilization of the dye from moist soil surfaces to air will not be important as C.I. Acid Blue 1 is an ionic compound. It may adsorb to clay sediments and particulate matter in the water due to ion-exchange processes. The loss of the dye from water surfaces by volatilization should not be important due to its ionic nature. The potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms should be low based on an estimated BCF value of 2. Occupational exposure may be through inhalation of dusts and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where C.I. Acid Blue 1 is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to C.I. Acid Blue 1 via ingestion of pharmaceuticals and dermal contact with products containing C.I. Acid Blue 1. (SRC)",

Acid Blue 1, the retention of the dye by ion-exchange processes(3,SRC), particularly on clay surfaces, and adsorption at mineral surfaces such as geothite(4,SRC), may lead to increased adsorption on some surfaces(SRC). As C.I. Acid Blue 1 is an ionic compound, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3,SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF value of 2(1,SRC), from a measured water solubility(2), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Chronic (long-term) exposure of humans toN-nitrosodimethylamine may cause liver damage and low platelet counts. Severe liver damage has been observed in animals. Limited human data are available on the carcinogenic effects of N- nitrosodimethylamine. Animal studies have suggested that chronic ingestion and inhalation of N- nitrosodimethylamine may cause an increase in liver tumors and other types of tumors.

N-Nitrosodimethylamine is a food contaminant especially in cured meat products. N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), also known as dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), is a semi-volatile organic chemical that is highly toxic and is a suspected human carcinogen. The US Environmental Protection Agency has determined that the maximum admissible concentration of NDMA in drinking water is 7 ng L 1. The EPA has not yet set a regulatory maximum contaminant level (MCL) for drinking water. At high doses, it is a potent hepatotoxin that can cause fibrosis of the liver in rats. The induction of liver tumors in rats after chronic exposure to low doses is well-documented. Its toxic effects on humans are inferred from animal experiments but not well-established experimentally. NDMA is an industrial by-product or waste product of several industrial processes. It first came to attention as a groundwater contaminant in California in 1998 and 1999 at several sites that produced rocket fuel. Manufacturing of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), which is a component of rocket fuel that requires NDMA for its synthesis, proved to be the culprit in these cases. Of more general concern, water treatment via chlorination or chloramination of organic nitrogen-containing wastewater can lead to the production of NDMA at potentially harmful levels. Further, NDMA can form or be leached during treatment of water by anion exchange resins. Finally, NDMA is found at low levels in numerous items of human consumption including cured meat, fish, beer, and tobacco smoke It is, however, unlikely to bioaccumulate.\n\nN-nitrosodimethylamine belongs to the family of Nitrosamines. These are compounds containing the nitrosamine functional group, with the structure R2NNO.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

DMNA has undergone oxidative demethylation as catalyzed by rodent and human hepatic microsomes; this reaction has given rise to reactive intermediates. Alkylation of guanine (to 7-methylguanlic acid) and of cytosine (to 3-methylcytosine) has been thought to underlie the biochemical basis of DMNA-induced carcinogenesis. Methylation of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in DMNA poisoning inhibited transIation. Although 7- methylguanylic acid has served as a normal nucleotide for RNA polymerase activity, the incorporation of 3-methylcytosine reduced efficiency. The alkylation of DNA by the reactive metabolites of DMNA resulted in a change in base sequence and deletion of one or more base pairs, changes indicative of the genotoxic mechanism of DMNA-induced carcinogenesis.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

After a single dose of dimethylnitrosamine injected i.v. (25 mg/kg body wt, 45 min before sacrifice) liver nuclei were isolated and incubated with micrococcal nuclease (EC 3.1.4.7) to an acid-solubility of 2.5% of total DNA. Chromatin was fractionated into a 1,200 g pellet P1, 102,000 g pellet P2 and supernatant fraction S2. Chromatin-bound RNA polymerase I plus III activity decreased 15% in the P1 and 25% in the P2 fraction. No changes in activity were observed in the S2 fraction. Chromatin-bound RNA polymerase II activity decreased 19% in the P1, 49% in the P2 and 32% in the S2 fraction. Heparin stimulated RNA polymerase II activity decreased 10% in the P1 and 44% in the P2 fraction. Formation of initiation in nuclear lysates with RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli increased after administration of dimethylnitrosamine suggesting an increase in the number of sites available for the start of new RNA chains. The results show that limited digestion of nuclei with endonuclease cleaves chromatin regions which are more affected by dimethylnitrosamine than the total chromatin suggesting a non-random effect of the hepatotoxin on chromatin. Modifications of the DNA template by dimethylnitrosamine is indicated by the change in number of initiation complexes.",

In addition, NDMA can form in the stomach during digestion of alkylamine-containing foods.  Alkylamines are naturally occurring compounds which are found in some drugs and in a variety of foods. Infants may be exposed to NDMA from the use of rubber baby bottle nipples and pacifiers which may contain very small amounts of NDMA, from ingestion of contaminated infant formulas, and from breast milk of some nursing mothers.  Very low levels of NDMA have been found in some samples of human breast milk. Occupational exposure may happen in a large number of places including industries such as tanneries, pesticide manufacturing plants, rubber and tire manufacturing plants, alkylamine manufacture/use industries, fish processing industries, foundries, and dye manufacturing plants.  Researchers making or handling NDMA may also be exposed to this compound if it passes through the rubber gloves they wear during laboratory work.  (L1207)"

[2] Short-term exposure limit (REL-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday. [3] Ceiling limit (REL-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The carcinogen should be enclosed in a securely sealed, watertight container (primary container), which should be enclosed in a second, unbreakable, leakproof container that will withstand chem attack from the carcinogen (secondary container). The space between primary & secondary container should be filled with absorbent material, which would withstand chem attack from the carcinogen & is sufficient to absorb the entire contents of the primary container in the event of breakage or leakage. Each secondary container should then be enclosed in a strong outer box. The space between the secondary container & the outer box should be filled with an appropriate quantity of shock-absorbent material.

In this study, we investigated the protective effect of resveratrol on hepatic injury induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in rats. Oral administration of resveratrol (20 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks) remarkably prevented the DMN-induced loss in body and liver weight, and inhibited the elevation of serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels. Resveratrol also increased serum albumin and hepatic glutathione levels and reduced the hepatic level of malondialdehyde due to its antioxidant effect. Furthermore, DMN-induced elevation of hydroxyproline content was reduced in the resveratrol treated rats, the result of which was consistent with the reduction in type I collagen mRNA expression and the histological analysis of liver tissue stained with Sirius red. The reduction in hepatic stellate cell activation, as assessed by alpha-smooth muscle actin staining, and the reduction in transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA expression were associated with resveratrol treatment. In conclusion, resveratrol exhibited in vivo hepatoprotective and antifibrogenic effects against DMN-induced liver injury, suggesting that resveratrol may be useful in the prevention of the development of hepatic fibrosis.",

Thereafter, the animals were maintained on laboratory chow and tap water ad libitum for another 2 weeks and received 1.5 mg DMN i.p. per day for the first 5 days. This 5-week cycle was repeated three more times. Chronic treatment with an alcohol-containing diet was shown to significantly improve the mean survival time of DMN-treated rats compared with identically treated animals fed the control diet, but the total number of tumors observed under these experimental conditions and the target organ remained virtually unchanged.",

In one experiment, both germ-free and conventional rats were intubated with DMN in respective doses of 8, 9, and 10 mg/kg bw, while in another experiment, both groups were intubated with DMA (1500 mg/kg) plus NaNO2 (100 mg/kg). In both experiments, 48 hr after intubation, there was a marked difference in the degree of liver necrosis and the levels of serum GPT and GOT between the groups. In particular, a dose of 8 mg of DMN or 1500 mg of DMA plus 100 mg of NaNO2 produced severe liver necrosis in the majority of germ-free rats, while the same dose did not produce any detectable liver necrosis in the majority of conventional rats. At a dose of 8 mg, serum GPT and GOT levels were raised to 22 and 15 times normal values, respectively, in germ-free rats, but only to about twice the normal values for both levels in conventional rats. At the combination dose of DMA plus NaNO2, the levels of serum GPT and GOT were raised to 40 and 30 times normal values, respectively, in germ-free rats, while both levels remained almost normal in conventional rats. Thus, the results indicated that the liver of the germ-free state was far more susceptible to the acute toxic effects of DMN as well as DMA plus NaNO2 administration at a certain dose range than was the liver of the conventional state, suggesting the influence of the absence of microflora.",

The assessment of possible liver necrosis was made by determination of isocitric dehydrogenase (ICD), glutamate oxalacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) in plasma. The ability of pigeon liver slices to metabolize CO2 or to give covalent binding of reactive metabolites to nucleic acids was 24 times smaller than that for rat. Similarly, the pigeon liver microsomes or 9000 X g supernatant have DMN-demethylase activity or ability to activate DMN to reactive metabolites that bind covalently to proteins very close to zero. Results suggest that resistance of pigeon liver to DMN acute effects is related to its lack of ability for DMN metabolic activation.",

The course and intensity of the disease was not influenced by the application route, but was directly related to the amount of DMNA given per kg body weight, causing hemorrhagic centrolobular liver necrosis and acute vessel changes. ... The LD50 determined after 4 wk was 10 mg DMNA/kg body weight In a longer experiment 18 foxes in 3 groups were given 2 weekly doses of DMNA in food. They were treated with daily estimated doses of 1.0, 0.2 and 0.1 mg DMNA/kg body weight, respectively. The foxes in groups 1 and 2 developed ascites, jaundice, and liver failure after intake of 45-70 mg DMNA/kg body weight. The foxes treated with 1 mg DMNA/kg body weight showed centrolobular hemorrhagic liver necrosis and productive vessel changes in the hepatic vein system. The second group given 0.2 mg DMNA/kg body weight developed hemorrhagic centrolobular necrosis which healed with fibrosis leading to cirrhosis and chronic occlusion in many hepatic veins. Noduli of chondroid lamellae and foci of hematopoietic tissue and early stages of hemagiomatous liver tumors were found in the liver. The group exposed to 0.1 mg of DMNA/kg body weight/day developed thickening in the walls of the hepatic veins. After more than 3.5 yr of exposure, multiple hemangiosarcomas grew out from the changed vessel walls. In a shorter experiment with daily DMNA doses in the feed below 0.165 mg/kg body weight, all the foxes were completely healthy and only some showed beginning changes in the hepatic vein walls. Hematomas were often seen in foxes dying after a single DMNA dose. One fox treated with 0.1 mg DMNA/kg body weight died of brain bleeding after 220 days of treatment. Chronic vessel changes were found in the heart and kidneys of the DMNA treated foxes. DMNA produces vessel changes of a more general nature.",

One injection of NDMA at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/mussel produced, within 15 days extensive inflammatory reactions in the supporting leydig cell tissue in the digestive diverticula, necrosis of the epithelium lining, the digestive tubules, and necrosis of germinal epithelium lining the genital follicles. 8 weekly injections of 0.2 mg, exam for 30 wk produced extensive collagenous scar tissue formation between the tubules of the digestive diverticula, presence of numerous granulocytomas, and necrosis of the germinal epithelium of the genital follicles.",

N-Nitrosodimethylamine's former production and use in the production of rocket fuels; antioxidant; additive for lubricants; and as a softener of copolymers may have resulted in its release to the environment through various waste streams. N-Nitrosodimethylamine is formed as a byproduct during disinfection processes used at wastewater treatment facilities. If released to air, a measured vapor pressure of 2.7 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates N-nitrosodimethylamine is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase N-nitrosodimethylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of 6.3 days. N-Nitrosodimethylamine absorbs light in the environmental spectrum indicating a potential for direct photolysis in sunlight. If released to soil, observed Koc values of 68-118 indicate N-nitrosodimethylamine is expected to have high mobility. Low adsorption to soils and ready leaching have been observed in several studies. Volatilization from wet soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon a measured Henry's Law constant of 1.08X10-6 atm-cu m/mole at 20 \u00b0C. Under laboratory conditions, greater than 70% of N-nitrosodimethylamine applied to the surface of a moist, warm soil (12% moisture content, 22 \u00b0C) volatilized in 10 hours. N-Nitrosodimethylamine may potentially volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its measured vapor pressure. A half-life of about three weeks was reported for N-nitrosodimethylamine in aerobic soil under laboratory conditions; the primary removal processes were volatilization and biodegradation. At 21 \u00b0C, observed half-lives in ground cover soil, turfgrass soil and tree soil were 4.1, 5.6 and 22.5 days respectively. The rates and extent of N-nitrosodimethylamine biodegradation in natural environments, including surface waters, sludges and soils have been observed to be highly variable. If released into water, N-nitrosodimethylamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon its Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur based upon this compound's  Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 29 and 215 days, respectively. The potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low based upon an estimated BCF of 3. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process. A photodegradation half-life of 79 hours was measured in distilled water exposed to fluorescent light through a pyrex filter (wavelength >280 nm). The direct photolysis rate constant for N-nitrosodimethylamine in aqueous solution exposed to irradiation representing Southern California midsummer, midday sun was observed to be 0.040/min with a half-life of 16 minutes. Occupational exposure to N-nitrosodimethylamine may occur through inhalation of air at workplaces involved in rubber processing or tire manufacturing or where metal-working fluids are used. The general population may be exposed to N-nitrosodimethylamine via inhalation of ambient air and cigarette smoke and ingestion of contaminated food and drinking water. (SRC)",

Two studies have demonstrated N-nitrosodimethylamine formation in both sterile and non-sterile soils to which nitrite and dimethylamine were added(3,4). Another study demonstrated N-nitrosodimethylamine formation when sewage, dimethylamine and nitrite were continuously percolated through a soil(3). It was also demonstrated that N-nitrosodimethylamine may form from fertilized and polluted areas when dimethylamine was added(5).

Low adsorption to soils and ready leaching have been observed in other studies(3,4).  Volatilization of N-nitrosodimethylamine from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.08X10-6 atm-cu m/mole at 20 \u00b0C(5). Under laboratory conditions, greater than 70% of N-nitrosodimethylamine applied to the surface of a moist, warm soil (12% moisture content, 22 \u00b0C) volatilized in 10 hours(6). The potential for volatilization of N-nitrosodimethylamine from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based on a measured vapor pressure of 2.7 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C(5). A half-life of about three weeks was reported for N-nitrosodimethylamine in aerobic soil under laboratory conditions; the primary removal processes were volatilization and biodegradation(6). 17% of the added N-nitrosodimethylamine (132 ug/g soil) was lost from sandy loam soil after 10 days incubation at 30 \u00b0C; no further loss was noted during the next 30 days incubation(7). However, when the organic matter content was increased from 2.16% to 17.5%, over 60% of the added N-nitrosodimethylamine was lost by day 15 of the incubation period(7). At 21 \u00b0C, observed half-lives in ground cover soil, turfgrass soil and tree soil were 4.1, 5.6 and 22.5 days respectively(8). The rates and extent of N-nitrosodimethylamine biodegradation in natural environments, including surface waters, sludges and soils have been observed to be highly variable(9).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.08X10-6 atm-cu m/mole at 20 \u00b0C(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 29 days and 215 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from a measured log Kow of -0.57(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A photodegradation half-life of 79 hours was measured in distilled water following exposure to fluorescent light through a Pyrex filter(8). The direct photolysis rate constant for N-nitrosodimethylamine in aqueous solution exposed to irradiation representing Southern California midsummer, midday sun was observed to be 0.040/min with a half-life of 16 minutes(9). Hydrolysis is probably not an important removal process since the N-nitrosodimethylamine concentration in lake water essentially did not change after 3.5 months incubation at 30 \u00b0C in the dark(10). No biodegradation of N-nitrosodimethylamine was observed in lake water samples during an observation period of 3.5 months(11). Static and continuous biodegradation tests on N-nitrosodimethylamine using seed from an activated sludge plant and feed that contained a nutrient solution based on yeast extract resulted in 47 to 72% degradation of the N-nitrosodimethylamine in 7 days(12). The rates and extent of N-nitrosodimethylamine biodegradation in natural environments, including surface waters, sludges and soils have been observed to be highly variable(13). N-Nitrosodimethylamine disappeared rapidly from aqueous solution due to evaporation and photolysis, with acidic solutions giving a somewhat higher removal than basic solutions or water, half-life of 0.8 hours versus 0.9 and 1.6 hours, respectively(14).",

Vapor-phase N-nitrosodimethylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.3 days(SRC), calculated from its  measured rate constant of 2.53X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). N-Nitrosodimthylamine is susceptible to direct photolysis in sunlight(SRC) due to its strong absorption of UV light above 290 nm(4,5). The direct photolysis half-life in aqueous solution was observed to be 16 minutes using Southern California midday irradiation levels(5).",

In an activated sludge treatment plant, >95% of the approximately 2000 ug N-nitrosodimethylamine/L in the influent was removed(2). The rate of disappearance in raw sewage at pH 6.0 was nearly the same as that in sterile samples, indicating nonbiological factors were largely or entirely responsible for the N-nitrosodimethylamine disappearance(3). The rates and extent of N-nitrosodimethylamine biodegradation in natural environments, including surface waters, sludges and soils has been observed to be highly variable(4).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6.3 days(SRC) at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). N-Nitrosodimethylamine disappears rapidly from aqueous solution due to evaporation and photolysis, with acidic solutions giving a somewhat higher removal rate than basic solutions or water with half-lives of 0.8 hours in acidic solutions, 0.9 hours in basic solutions and 1.6 hours in water(2). N-Nitrosodimethylamine at an initial concentration of 74 mg/L photodegraded with a half-life of 79 hours in distilled water exposed to fluorescent light through a Pyrex filter (wavelength >280 nm)(3). The direct photolysis rate constant for N-nitrosodimethylamine in aqueous solution exposed to irradiation representing Southern California midsummer, midday sun was observed to be 0.040/min with a half-life of 16 minutes(4). The rate constant for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solution is 4.3X10+8 L/mol-sec(5); this corresponds to an aquatic half-life of 1136 days at an aquatic concentration of 1X10-17 hydroxyl radicals per liter(6). Hydrolysis of N-nitrosodimethylamine is probably not an important fate process since its concentration in lake water did not essentially change after 3.5 months incubation in the dark at 30 \u00b0C(7). Similar lack of hydrolysis was observed in groundwater adsorption studies(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The water samples were well stirred and maintained at 30 \u00b0C during this time. It should be noted that the concentration of dimethylnitrosamine never fell below 20 mg/l even though the water-depth in the petri dish did not exceed one centimeter.

Other N-nitrosodimethylamine concentrations in wastewater and wastewater related samples were: 2 ng/mL in an aerobic lagoon in Belle, WV(3); 2700 ng/L in a sewer sample in Baltimore(4); 0.2 to 0.3 ug/L in wastewater(5); 0.374 ug/g in a municipal sewage sludge sample(6); 53 ppb in dried sludge from a Syracuse, NY treatment plant(7); 0.2 ng/L in the influent to a wastewater treatment plant in Belle, WV(3); and 0.5 ng/mL in lagoon seepage at Belle, WV(3). Heavy duty diesel engines emitted from 4.4 to 136.0 g N-nitrosodimethylamine/hour; the maximum N-nitrosodimethylamine concentration in the diesel crankcase emissions was 17.2 ug/cu m(8). N-Nitrosodimethylamine has also been detected in the exhaust from catalyst equipped cars(9). Analysis of anaerobic digester mixed liquor (ADML) from three wastewater treatment plants in the southeastern US detected N-nitrosodimethylamine concentrations of 383, 273 and 159 ng/L, respectively(10); N-nitrosodimethylamine concentrations in the primary sludge supernatant and thickened waste-activated sludge ranged from 139 to 834 ug/L(10). Effluent samples collected from four wastewater treatment plants on the Quinnipiac River, CT in 2003 contained N-nitrosodimethylamine concentrations ranging from 7.6 to 400 ng/L(11). Effluent samples collected from seven wastewater treatment plants in Caifornia  between 2002 and 2004 contained median N-nitrosodimethylamine concentrations of about 80 ng/L in the untreated water(12).",

N-Nitrosodibutylamine was the principal N-nitrosamine found, along with trace amounts of N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, and N-nitrosopiperidine. Mean total volatile N-nitrosamine levels for baseline and compliance samples were 63.9 and 21.2 ppb, respectively. The pacifier lots sampled after January 1, 1984 showed a significant decrease in contamination levels, indicating that at least 98% of the market share is in compliance with the CPSC enforcement policy for N-nitrosamines in infant pacifiers sold in the United States.",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

It was initially approved in the USA in 1990's for the treatment of NSCLC.  It is a third-generation vinca alkaloid. The introduction of third-generation drugs (vinorelbine, gemcitabine, taxanes) in platinum combination improved survival of patients with advanced NSCLC, with very similar results from the various drugs. Treatment toxicities are considerable in the combination treatment setting.  A study was done on the clearance rate of vinorelbine on individuals with various single polymorphonuclear mutations.  It was found that there was 4.3-fold variation in vinorelbine clearance across the cohort, suggesting a strong influence of genetics on the clearance of this drug.",

Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

In a clinical trial in which patients were randomized to receive single-agent vinorelbine or vinorelbine plus cisplatin, grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia occurred more frequently with the combination (79%) than with single-agent vinorelbine (53%). In another randomized trial, grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia occurred more frequently in those receiving vinorelbine and cisplatin (82%) than in those receiving cisplatin alone (5%); fever and/or sepsis related to granulocytopenia occurred in 11% of patients receiving combination therapy compared with 0% of patients receiving cisplatin alone, and 4 patients receiving vinorelbine and cisplatin died of granulocytopenia-related sepsis.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

A group of 18 patients (12 planned) were entered into a multicenter phase I pharmacokinetic study following a crossover design with a 1-week wash-out period. Patients received the first dose of 80 mg/sq m oral vinorelbine either after fasting or after ingestion of a standard continental breakfast. The second dose of 80 mg/sq m was administered 1 week later in the alternate feeding condition to the first dose. Of the 18 patients, 13 were eligible for pharmacokinetic evaluation. The mean time to maximum concentration (T(max)) was shorter in fasted patients (1.63+/-0.98 hr in blood, 1.67+/-0.96 hr in plasma) than in fed patients (2.48+/-1.40 hr in blood, 2.56+/-1.65 hr in plasma) but these differences are not likely to modify the safety and/or efficacy of oral vinorelbine. Values for C(max) and AUC were similar in fed and fasted patients and no significant differences were observed. The safety profile of oral vinorelbine observed in this limited number of patients appears to be comparable to that usually reported for vinorelbine, the main toxicity being neutropenia. Only one episode of febrile neutropenia was reported. The main nonhematological toxicities encountered were gastrointestinal, consisting of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation. A tendency for a lower incidence of vomiting was suggested when oral vinorelbine was administered after a standard breakfast. Based on this study, the administration of oral vinorelbine to fasted patients is not mandatory since administration after a standard breakfast does not lead to differences in body exposure to the drug. ...",

Two metabolites of vinorelbine have been identified in human blood, plasma, and urine; vinorelbine N-oxide and deacetylvinorelbine. Deacetylvinorelbine has been demonstrated to be the primary metabolite of vinorelbine in humans, and has been shown to possess antitumor activity similar to vinorelbine,.  Vinorelbine is metabolized into two other minor metabolites, 20'-hydroxyvinorelbine and vinorelbine 6'-oxide.  Therapeutic doses of vinorelbine (30 mg/m2) yield very small, if any, quantifiable levels of either metabolite in blood or urine. The metabolism of vinorelbine is mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily,.  As the liver provides the main route for metabolism of the drug, patients with hepatic impairment may demonstrate increased toxicity with standard dosing, however, there are no available data on this. Likewise, the contribution of cytochrome P450 enzyme action to vinorelbine metabolism has potential implications in patients receiving other drugs metabolized by this route.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

This structural modification contributes to unique pharmacologic properties.The antitumor activity of vinorelbine tartrate is believed to be owed to the inhibition of mitosis at metaphase via its interaction with tubulin.  Vinorelbine is a mitotic spindle poison that interferes with chromosomal segregation during mitosis, also known as cell division. It pauses cells at the _G2/M_ phases, when present at concentrations close to the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). Microtubules, which are derived from polymers of tubulin, are the main target of vinorelbine.   The chemical modification used to produce vinorelbine allows for the opening of the eight-member catharanthine ring with the formation of both a covalent and reversible bond with tubulin.  The relative contribution of different microtubule-associated proteins in the production of tubulin vary between neural tissue and proliferating cells and this has important functional implications. The ability of vinorelbine to bind specifically to mitotic rather than other microtubules has been shown and may suggest that neurotoxicity is less likely to be a problem than with the molecular mechanism of action.   As with other anti-microtubule agents, vinorelbine is known to contribute apoptosis in malignant cells. The exact mechanisms by which this process occurs are complex and many details are yet to be elucidated. The disarray of the microtubule structure has a number of effects, including the induction of tumor suppressor gene _p53_ and activation/inactivation of a number of protein kinases involved in essential signaling pathways, including _p21 WAF1/CIP1_ and _Ras/Raf_, _PKC/PKA_. These molecular changes lead to phosphorylation and consequently inactivation of the apoptosis inhibitor _Bcl2_. This, in turn, results in a decrease in the formation of heterodimers between _Bcl2_ and the pro-apoptotic gene _BAX_, stimulating the sequence of cell apoptosis.  Vinorelbine tartrate also possibly interferes with amino acid, cyclic AMP and glutathione metabolism, calmodulin-dependent Ca++-transport ATPase activity, cellular respiration, and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis.",

Microtubules are organelles that exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium with their components, tubulin dimers. They form an essential part of the mitotic spindle, participate in intracellular transport, and contribute to the cell's shape, rigidity, and motility. Vinorelbine and other vinca alkaloids exert their cytotoxic effects by binding to tubulin, the protein subunit of the spindle microtubules. The formation of vinorelbine-tubulin complexes prevents the polymerization of the tubulin subunits into microtubules and induces depolymerization of microtubules resulting in inhibition of microtubule assembly and cellular metaphase arrest.",

On the basis of results with purified microtubules and in living interphase cells, /investigators/  hypothesized that it involves suppression of spindle microtubule dynamics. The effects of the three Vinca alkaloids on dynamics of centromeres and spindle kinetochore-microtubules /were measured/ by a novel approach involving quantitative time-lapse confocal microscopy in living mitotic human U2OS cells. Green fluorescent protein-labeled centromere-binding protein B was used to mark centromeres and kinetochore-microtubule plus ends. In controls, pairs of centromeres on sister chromatids alternated under tension between increasing and decreasing separation (stretching and relaxing). All three of the Vinca alkaloids suppressed centromere dynamics similarly at concentrations that block mitosis. At concentrations approximating the IC(50)s for mitotic accumulation (18.8 nM vinflunine, 7.3 nM vinorelbine, and 6.1 nM vinblastine), centromere dynamicity decreased by 44%, 25%, and 26%, respectively, and the time centromeres spent in a paused state increased by 63%, 52%, and 36%, respectively. Centromere relaxation rates, stretching durations, and transition frequencies all decreased. Thus all three of the drugs decreased the normal microtubule-dependent spindle tension at the centromeres/kinetochores, thereby preventing the signal for mitotic checkpoint passage. The strong correlation between suppression of kinetochore-microtubule dynamics and mitotic block indicates that the primary mechanism by which the Vinca alkaloids block mitosis is suppression of spindle microtubule dynamics.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

Six months /ago/  she had recurrence, this time in the right breast and skin. Despite first-and second-line chemotherapy, the mass showed progression of the disease. Thereafter, a weekly treatment of vinorelbine and trastuzumab was started, but one month later, she developed a slight fever and dry cough. A chest CT scan revealed an infiltration shadow showing non-specific interstitial pattern in the right lung. A bronchoscopic examination showed lymphocyte dominance in bronchial lavage fluid, and lymphocyte infiltration into the interstium with fibrosis in the tissue specimens was found by transbronchial lung biopsy. After discontinuing the above vinorelbine therapy, the patient's condition improved. /Investigators/ therefore diagnosed this as a case of vinorelbine-and trastuzumab-induced interstitial pneumonia.",

Extravasation: Immediately stop the infusion and withdraw as much fluid as possible by negative pressure on the syringe. Then give the following specific treatment: Place a heating pad over the area and apply heat intermittently for 24 hours; elevate the limb. Local injection of hyaluronidase may be beneficial. Do not use ice packs. /For/ decontamination administer activated charcoal orally if conditions are appropriate. Gastric lavage is not necessary after small to moderate ingestions if activated charcoal can be given promptly.

A Phase I/II protocol was designed in which vinorelbine was given as an 8-mg intravenous bolus followed by a 96-hour continuous infusion of 7-14 mg/sq m/day. Sixty patients were enrolled in the study: all had MBC and had received prior chemotherapy, and they had no known dermatologic disorder. Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) developed in 4 of the 60 patients. Patient 1 started with vinorelbine at 12 mg/sq m/day. She developed typical HFS. In the second course, her dose was decreased to 11 mg/sq m/day, but again she experienced HFS. In the third course, dexamethasone was added to the regimen, and no HFS was observed in the remaining six courses. Patient 2 started with a dose of 9 mg/sq m/ day. She received four courses without complications; but when the vinorelbine dose was escalated to 10 mg/sq m/day, HFS developed. Patient 3 started with a vinorelbine dose of 14 mg/sq m/day. She developed mucositis during the first two courses and HFS during the third. Patient 4 received vinorelbine at a dose of 13 mg/sq m/day and developed significant HFS. All patients had complete dermatologic recovery. No toxic skin reactions were observed in 14 patients receiving vinorelbine doses of <10 mg/sq m/day, whereas 4 of 46 treated at 10-14 mg/sq m/day developed HFS, suggesting a relationship of dose to HFS occurrence.",

Six patients had moderate/severe pain in the tumor location; concomitantly, one patient had chest pain. Four patients required major opiates. The clinical picture reverted and no patient had acute or chronic neurotoxicity. The readministration of vinorelbine triggered pain again, and all patients refused to continue the therapeutic program",

In vivo experiments demonstrated that all drugs assessed induced genetic toxicity, causing increments in the incidence of mutational events, as well as in somatic recombination. Another point to be considered is the fact that VNR was able to induce, respectively, approximately 13.0 and 1.7 times more mutant clones per millimolar exposure unit as their analogues VCR and VBL. The replacement of a CH(3) attached to vindoline group in VBL by a CHO in VCR seems to be responsible for the approximately seven times higher potency of the former. In contrast, the structural modifications on VNR's catharantine group could be related to its higher genotoxic potency, as well as its similar mutagenic and recombinagenic action.",

The in vitro growth of colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM), burst forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming units-mix (CFU-mix) was dose-dependently inhibited by VRB. The highest dose assayed (0.02 ug/mL) suppressed all of the different progenitor cells by 100%. A comparison of the dose-response curves showed that CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-mix exhibited similar-patterns of sensitivity to the cytotoxic action of VRB. Long-term bone marrow cultures have provided a valuable in vitro model for studying the role of the microenvironment of bone marrow. Cellularity of stromal layers was reduced with increasing doses of VRB. The appearance of these layers was altered minimally with the lowest dose used; a gradual loss of cellularity was seen in cultures exposed to 0.05 and 0.075 ug/mL; and a marked loss at the dose of 0.1 ug/mL. /Investigators/ results show that VRB has an important effect on hematopoietic progenitors at the highest dose tested, while the stromal cells were not affected at a similar dose (0.025 ug/mL), suggesting that the stroma is more resistant to this drug.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Indeed, until it was realized that it could be synthesized by humans, orotic acid was known as vitamin B-13. The richest dietary sources are cow's milk and other dairy products as well as root vegetables such as carrots and beets. Dietary intake probably contributes to a basal rate of orotic acid excretion in urine because fasting decreases excretion by ~50%. However, it is now apparent that most urinary orotic acid is synthesized in the body, where it arises as an intermediate in the pathway for the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Orotic acid is converted to UMP by UMP synthase, a multifunctional protein with both orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidylate decarboxylase activity. The most frequently observed inborn error of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis is a mutation of the multifunctional protein UMP synthase. This disorder prevents the conversion of orotic acid to UMP and thus to other pyrimidines. As a result, plasma orotic acid accumulates to high concentrations, and increased quantities appear in the urine. Indeed, urinary orotic acid is so markedly increased in individuals harboring a mutation in UMP synthase that orotic acid crystals can form in the urine. The urinary concentration of orotic acid in homozygotes can be of the order of millimoles per millimole creatinine. By comparison, the urinary level in unaffected individuals is ~ 1 umol/mmol creatinine.  (A3380).",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Two major age groups (group I, < 30 days and group II, > 180 days old) were used in these experiments, which lasted 30 and 50 days, respectively; the orotic salts were incorporated (10%) into Purina Lab Chow given ad libitum. Macroscopic and microscopic assessment of pathologic changes together with ECG recordings revealed that MgO treatment significantly reduces myocardial damage, especially the severity of calcific changes. ECG recordings clearly demonstrated a significant shortening of QTc and PR intervals, resulting in partial electrical stabilization of failing hearts, with a significant delay in systemic congestive changes. The prevention of heart lesions was less evident in animals receiving OA, but both preparations proved to be equally efficient in prolonging survival of the CM hamsters.",

Three studies were performed: (1) The time course of changes in tissue and plasma concentrations of pyrimidine compounds was examined in unoperated rats after the administration of 100 mg/kg OA. (2) Rats were given OA (30 mg/kg/d) for 2 days after experimental infarction, and tissue and plasma pyrimidine concentrations were examined; the hearts were removed for perfusion in the isolated working rat heart model (37 degrees C), subjected to 30 minutes of global ischemia, and recovery of function was assessed. AN content was assessed in the noninfarcted myocardium before and after ischemia. Isolated hearts were subjected to 30 minutes of hypoxic perfusion and the effect of adding 17 microM uridine to the perfusate was examined. Study 1 showed that OA administration produced an increase in hepatic uridine and cytidine, followed by increased plasma uridine and cytidine (cytidine, +55%, P < 0.001; uridine, +124%, P = 0.011). Myocardial uracil nucleotides increased temporarily after 4 hours (+21%, P < 0.01). In infarcted hearts after 2 days of OA administration, there were no significant changes in myocardial uracil or cytosine nucleotides or total RNA. Infarction significantly reduced functional recovery after global ischemia (sham = 62%; infarct = 26% of preischemic level; P < 0.05). OA improved the recovery of preischemic function by 133% (P < 0.05) in infarcted, but not sham-operated, hearts. Preischemic ATP and total adenine nucleotides (TAN) were decreased in the surviving myocardium of infarcted hearts (ATP reduced from 21.7 +/- 0.8 to 14.7 +/- 0.7 mumol/g dry wt, P < 0.001; TAN decreased from 30.3 +/- 0.8 to 22.4 +/- 1.1 mumol/g dry wt, P < 0.001). OA treatment prevented these reductions. Study 3 showed that uridine improved myocardial ATP and TAN levels, and decreased purine loss in hypoxic hearts. The increased AN levels were accompanied by evidence of enhancement of anerobic glycolysis.",

The aim of this work was to investigate whether orotate is differently metabolized in gut and in liver thus explaining the lack of effect on the intestinal lipoproteins secretion.

Indeed, radioactive aspartate and orotate were not incorporated into intestinal cells RNA. The absence of orotate metabolisation by lack of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase activity in rat intestine would explain why this organ, in contrast to the liver, is protected against disturbances of nucleotide metabolism and lipoproteins secretion induced by orotic-acid-supplemented diets.",

Free orotic acid is obtained from the alkali salt by treatment with mineral acid.  A newer synthesis starts by condensing chloroacetoacetyl chlorine, obtained from diketene and chlorine, with urea to give 6-chloromethyluracil. Oxidation of the latter with hydrogen peroxide in an alkaline medium yields orotic acid.  In another method, hydantoin or hydantonitrile is treated with glycolic acid in an alkaline medium to give carboxymethylene hydantoin, which rearranges to form orotic acid.  Orotic acid is also produced in fermentation by using microorganisms such as Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium.",

They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Carboxylic acids with six or fewer carbon atoms are freely or moderately soluble in water; those with more than six carbons are slightly soluble in water. Soluble carboxylic acid dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Many insoluble carboxylic acids react rapidly with aqueous solutions containing a chemical base and dissolve as the neutralization generates a soluble salt. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Insoluble carboxylic acids react with solutions of cyanides to cause the release of gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymerization reactions; like other acids, they often catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions.",

This is attributed primarily to the stimulation of hepatic phosphatidylcholine synthesis by dietary orotic acid. In the absence of phenobarbital, orotic acid was shown to cause some increase in liver smooth endoplasmic reticulum components, but not cytochrome P-450. Orotic acid also decreased the activity of microsomal phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, which may have contributed to the increase in the microsomal content of phosphatidylethanolamine. The hypothesis is advanced that phospholipid availability is a limiting factor in the hepatic response to phenobarbital. When more phospholipid is available to provide the structural framework for biogenesis of endoplasmic reticulum, all of the hepatic actions of phenobarbital, including induction of cytochrome P-450, are amplified.",

The creation of nucleotide pool imbalances by dietary orotic acid, for e.g., an increase in uridine nucleotides and a decrease in adenine nucleotides, was considered as a possible mechanism for the promotional effect of orotic acid on liver carcinogenesis. The significance of this hypothesis is that altered nucleotide pools affect both genomic as well as membrane organization. Consistent with this hypothesis is our finding that feeding rats with a diet containing 1% orotic acid for 10 weeks resulted in a liver DNA damage as monitored by its slower sedimentation in alkaline sucrose gradients compared to the corresponding controls. To assess the general applicability of this hypothesis, nucleotide pool imbalances were created by using methods other than feeding orotic acid and their effect on the incidence of gamma-glutamyltransferase positive foci in carcinogen initiated rats was determined. The results obtained indicated that rats initiated with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine.2HCl (100 mg/kg) given 18 hr after partial hepatectomy and exposed to diet deficient in arginine, a regimen that causes an increased synthesis and excretion of orotic acid, or were fed diets containing 1% thymidine or 1% thymine developed greater number of gamma-glutamyltransferase positive foci compared to the corresponding controls fed the basal diets.",

The present study was undertaken to evaluate hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP) function in a rat model of microvesicular steatosis produced by the intake of diets containing 1% orotic acid (OA) that were administered for 5, 10, or 21 days. Hepatic triglyceride levels were increased to 3-fold of control after 5 days and were elevated further at 10 and 21 days. Cholesterol and phospholipid contents were increased after 10 and 21 days but not by 5 days of feeding. Microsomal androst-4-ene-3,17-dione hydroxylation activities mediated by CYP2C11 (16alpha-hydroxylation) and CYP3A2 (6beta-hydroxylation) were decreased in liver from OA-fed rats for only 5 days, whereas CYP2A1/2-mediated steroid 7alpha-hydroxylation was decreased after 10 days; these observations were complemented by immunoblot analysis that demonstrated the impaired expression of the corresponding CYP proteins. CYP2C11 mRNA, the major CYP in male rat liver, was down-regulated in steatotic liver to 52 +/- 4% of control. Thus, microvesicular steatosis induced by short-term intake of OA-containing diets is histologically similar to that produced by hepatotoxic drugs and produces the rapid down-regulation of constitutive CYPs in rat liver.",

Cats were fed a control diet or a diet containing less protein. On day 1 of the control period, blood, urine, and liver biopsy specimens were obtained. Each cat was given an oral dose of water daily. On days 8, 15, and 22, blood and urine specimens were collected as on day 1. On day 29, liver, blood, and urine samples were obtained as on day 1. After a resting period of 30 to 60 days, cats were treated with orotic acid. Serum biochemical analyses, urinary OA-to-creatinine ratios, and liver biopsy specimens were evaluated. Cats were given OA orally (suspension or capsules) for 29 days. Sample collection and data obtained were identical to those described for the control period.  Urinary OA-to-creatinine ratios were significantly higher in all treated cats, but ratios were significantly higher in those receiving OA in capsules than in those receiving OA in suspension. Diet or treatment did not alter hepatic biochemical or histologic variables significantly. However, 7 cats given the highest dose of OA in capsules developed azotemia, urolithiasis, and renal changes. Most concentrations of OA used in this study did not induce HL in cats during a 29-day period, but the highest dosage used did result in renal disease.",

All animals infused with the carcinogen received the same doses. Results of the control group which received no OA or carcinogen were compared with the results of: (a) hamsters treated with HPOP and fed a regular 20% protein synthetic diet (group 1); (b) hamsters fed the OA diet for a brief time period during initiation with the carcinogen (group 2); and (c) hamsters in which OA was administered after carcinogen infusion for life (group 3). All animals of the control group were normal at autopsy, while those in group 1 (HPOP alone) revealed the spectrum of lesions accepted as classical in the multistep hyperplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma in situ (CIS) sequence of carcinogenesis. Results of group 2, in light of group 1, revealed an increased incidence of the following lesions in the common pancreatic duct: dilatation, 2.5 times; flat and papillary hyperplasia, 2 times; and dysplasia (atypical hyperplasia), 12 times. No significant increase of CIS and invasive cancer in the body and tail of the pancreas was observed; in addition, the incidence, nature, and location of pancreatic adenocarcinomas were not affected. Yet, the effect of OA administered after carcinogen infusion (group 3) when compared to group 1 seemed to enhance a further increase in the incidence of practically all lesions throughout the pancreas. An obvious overall step-up incidence along the multistep hyperplasia-dysplasia-CIS-invasive cancer process in the pancreas was observed. The increase in incidence of flat, papillary, and atypia of the epithelium of the common pancreatic duct in group 3 was mild compared to that found in the same duct of group 2, but the increase in incidence of these same three lesions when found in the main ducts was marked: flat hyperplasia, 3-fold; papillary hyperplasia, 2.5-fold; atypical hyperplasia, 3-fold. The increase in incidence of CIS in this group was 5-fold and papillary adenocarcinomas, 3-fold, when compared to 5% found in groups 1 and 2. Hepatic malignancies (cholangiocarcinomas) occurred in 6% of the cases in group 3 compared to none in group 2; the incidence of malignancy in the gallbladder was the same in groups 2 and 3 but three times greater than that in group 1.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates orotic acid will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase orotic acid may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, orotic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Orotic acid exists as a combination of several ionized species at pH range 5-9; therefore, volatilization from moist soil and water surfaces will not occur. No biodegradation data were located for orotic acid. If released into water, orotic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Orotic acid may undergo direct photolysis in sunlit surface waters since it absorbs light greater than 290 nm in aqueous solution; however, the rate of photolysis is unknown. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to orotic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where orotic acid is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not an important environmental fate process because orotic acid will exist in ionized form based on pKa values of 2.07 and 9.45(4), and ionized species do not volatilize(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Orotic acid may undergo direct photolysis in sunlit surface waters since it absorbs light greater than 290 nm(7), but the rate of this reaction is not known(SRC). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2005).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.97X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-undecanol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-undecanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 23 hours. If released to soil, 1-undecanol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8,800. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 1-Undecanol is expected to biodegrade rapidly in soil and water based on sewage and sludge studies. If released into water, 1-undecanol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 20 hours and 10 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 9 months if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 86 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1-undecanol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-undecanol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-undecanol via ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other consumer products containing 1-undecanol.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 20 hours and 10 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 9 months if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 86(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). The theoretical BOD for 1-undecanol was 27.6% after 5-day incubation in sewage(8), indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 1-undecanol is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 20 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 10 days(SRC). 1-Undecanol's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 9 months when adsorption is considered(3). 1-Undecanol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 2.97X10-3 mm Hg(4).",

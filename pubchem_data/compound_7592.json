When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This technique is particularly useful to study aromatic, conjugated, and other substances containing a pi bond.  Modern ultraviolet spectrophotometers also cover the visible light range, in which case the technique is called ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Ketones are reactive with many acids and bases liberating heat and flammable gases (e.g., H2). The amount of heat may be sufficient to start a fire in the unreacted portion of the ketone. Ketones react with reducing agents such as hydrides, alkali metals, and nitrides to produce flammable gas (H2) and heat. Ketones are incompatible with isocyanates, aldehydes, cyanides, peroxides, and anhydrides. They react violently with aldehydes, HNO3, HNO3 + H2O2, and HClO4.",

If released to the atmosphere, acetoacetanilide is expected to exist both in the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere based on an extrapolated vapor pressure of 5.2X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase acetoacetanilide is expected to degrade by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of 1.2 days). Particulate-phase acetoacetanilide may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. If released to the soil, acetoacetanilide is expected to be highly mobile based on an estimated Koc of 12. Acetoacetanilide is not expected to volatilize from either wet or dry soil, based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-12 atm-cu m/mol and an extrapolated vapor pressure of 5.2X10-5 mm Hg, respectively. If released into water, biodegradation of acetoacetanilide is expected to be an important removal process. An estimated BCF of 3.4 suggests that bioconcentration of acetoacetanilide in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis, adsorption to soil and sediment, and volatilization are not expected to be environmentally important removal processes in aquatic systems. Occupational exposure to acetoacetanilide is expected to primarily occur through dermal contact in workplaces where it is produced and used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

It plays an essential function in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Alfacaldisol is activated by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase in the liver to mediate its effects in the body, or most importantly, the kidneys and bones. The pharmacological actions of alfacalcidol are prolonged than vitamin D because a negative feedback mechanism regulates the final activation step of vitamin D in the kidneys.  Alfacalcidol is available in oral and intravenous formulations. In Canada, it is marketed as ONE-ALPHA, which manages hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and osteodystrophy in adults with chronic renal failure. In approving European countries, alfacalcidol is also indicated for managing nutritional and malabsorptive rickets and osteomalacia, vitamin D-dependent rickets and osteomalacia, and hypophosphataemic vitamin D resistant rickets and osteomalacia.",

It also modestly promotes intestinal phosphorus absorption. In patients with renal failure, alfacalcidol increased intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption in a dose-related manner. This increase in calcium and phosphorus levels occurs within three days following drug administration: this effect was reversed within three days of drug discontinuation. In patients with chronic renal failure, serum calcium levels were elevated while parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels returned to normal levels within five days following alfacalcidol administration. Since alfacalcidol suppresses parathyroid hormone, a reduction in parathyroid hormone levels is achieved more rapidly in patients on intermittent intravenous therapy, with significant reductions occurring within three months of therapy. In patients receiving daily oral therapy of alfacalcidol, the time it takes alfacalcidol to normalize plasma calcium levels may be up to several months, possibly reflecting calcium being utilized for bone mineralization. In patients with nutritional osteomalacia, alfacalcidol increased calcium absorption with six hours of oral administration and the effects peaked at 24 hours.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

It sets up criteria for the classification of chemicals for physical-chemical, health, and environmental hazards of chemical substances and mixtures and sets up standardized hazard information to facilitate global trade of chemicals.  Please note that obsolete codes are added in this classification for completeness purposes, as they are still in use. Any obsolete codes are annotated as such.",

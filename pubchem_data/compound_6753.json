When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The potassium salt of meta-cresol is methylated with dimethyl sulfate to give the methyl ether, which is then butylated using isobutyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride. The resulting tert-butylcresyl methyl ether is obtained in yields of 55 to 60% and is purified with fractionation. Nitration at temperatures below 0 \u00b0C with fuming nitric acid leads to the formation of the dinitro derivatives in yields of 45 to 60%. The pure product is obtained by crystallization from 95% ethanol. The by-products in this case consist of the mononitro derivative, 4,6-dinitro-meta-cresol methyl ether and smaller amounts of trinitro derivatives",

Photocontact reactions to musk ambrette (19 cases) and PABA (19 cases) were surprisingly frequent. The next most common photocontact reactions were to promethazine (24), chlorpromazine (22 cases) and fentichlor (12).

The data show that under the test conditions used, photosensitivity responses can be produced, and combinations of these as well as the other biological responses can be readily defined. The results indicate that musk ambrette is photoallergenic, that 8-methoxypsoralen is phototoxic and that Triton X-15 is only a slight irritant. On the other hand, results with TCSA suggest that it is a strong contact allergen and photoallergen, while 6-methylcoumarin would be considered to be a weak contact allergen with weak phototoxic properties. Previous reports that barrier destruction or adjuvanticity is necessary to produce photoallergy to musk ambrette were not confirmed; by ensuring occlusion using standard methods, the photoallergic nature of the response to this material was clearly demonstrated. ...",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.31X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates musk ambrette will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase musk ambrette will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 11 days. Particulate-phase musk ambrette will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Musk ambrette contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, musk ambrette is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 5,300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.05X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, musk ambrette is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 85 days and 1.8 years, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 200 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to musk ambrette may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where musk ambrette is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to musk ambrette via ingestion of contaminated food or from inhalation. Dermal absorption may play a role after application of musk containing perfumes and cosmetics to the skin or from textiles containing musk fragrance residues from laundry detergents. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.05X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 85 days and 1.8 years, respectively(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 37 years when adsorption is considered(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

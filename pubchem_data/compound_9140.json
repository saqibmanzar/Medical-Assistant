In the present study, individual stereoisomers of the bay-region diol epoxides of chrysene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyrene as well as of the fjord-region diol epoxides of benzo[c]phenanthrene, benzo[c]chrysene, and benzo[g]-chrysene have been incubated with GSH in the presence of human glutathione transferases GSTM1-1 (a mu-class enzyme) and GSTP1-1 (a pi-class enzyme). As previously shown with GSTA1-1 (an alpha-class enzyme) both M1-1 and P1-1 demonstrate considerable activity toward a number of the diol epoxides studied, although a great variation in catalytic efficiency and enantioselectivity was observed. With GSTM1-1, the bay-region diol epoxides, in particular the syn-diastereomers were in most cases more efficiently conjugated with GSH than the fjord-region analogues. GSTM1-1 demonstrated an enantioselectivity ranging from no preference (50%) to high preference (> or = 90%) for conjugation of the enantiomers with R-configuration at the benzylic position of the oxirane ring. With GSTP1-1, the enzyme demonstrated appreciable activity toward both bay- and fjord-region diol epoxides and, in most cases, a preference for the anti-diastereomers. In contrast to GSTM1-1 and as previously shown for GSTA1-1, GSTP1-1 showed an exclusive preference for conjugation of the enantiomers with R-configuration at the benzylic oxirane carbon. With both GSTM1-1 and GSTP1-1, the chemically most reactive diol epoxide, the (+)-syn-enantiomer of trans-7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,-10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPDE), was the best substrate. As for GSTA1-1, no obvious correlation between chemical reactivity or lipophilicity of the compounds and catalytic efficiencies was observed. Molecular modeling of diol epoxides in the active sites of GSTP1-1 and -A1-1 is in agreement with the assumption, based on functional studies, that the H-site of GSTA1-1  can accommodate stereoisomers of different sizes. Further, modeling of the enantiomers of anti- and syn-BPDE in the active site of GSTP1-1 provides an explanation for the exclusive preference for the enantiomers with R-configuration at the benzylic oxirane carbon. These isomers could be snuggly fitted in the H-site close to the GSH sulfur, whereas those with opposite stereochemistry could not.",

Since the fjord region dihydrodiol epoxides were hydrolytically unstable under the experimental conditions, their enzymatic formation was determined by analyzing the tetraols as their products of acidic hydrolysis upon addition of perchloric acid. The various stereoisomeric tetraols formed were separated by HPLC and identified by co-chromatography with authentic tetraols, which had been prepared by acidic hydrolysis of synthetically available syn- and anti-dihydrodiol epoxides and characterized by NMR and UV spectroscopy. Under standardized conditions the acidic hydrolysis of syn-dihydrodiol epoxides of benzo[c]chrysene, benzo[g]chrysene and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene resulted in the formation of two tetraols with cis/trans ratios of 81:19, 77:23 and 80:20, respectively, whereas the anti-dihydrodiol epoxides underwent almost exclusively trans hydrolysis. The proportion of the stereoisomeric tetraols obtained from microsomal incubations indicates that all three dihydrodiols are predominantly oxidized at the adjacent olefinic double bond to the anti-diastereomers of the corresponding fjord region dihydrodiol epoxides accounting for 4-35% of the ethyl acetate-extractable metabolites. To allow quantitative assessment of the metabolites (3)H-labeled trans-dihydrodiols were synthesized by reduction of the corresponding o-quinones with sodium borotritide. Metabolic conversion of benzo[c]chrysene-trans-9,10- and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene-trans-11,12-dihydrodiol by rat liver microsomes were in a similar low range during the first 10 min of incubation (6.2 +/- 1.2 and 3.4 +/- 1.0 nmol substrate/nmol cytochrome P450/10 min, respectively), whereas the conversion of benzo[g]chrysene-trans-11,12-dihydrodiol was much higher (20.6 +/- 2.2 nmol substrate/nmol cytochrome P450/10 min). Given the strong intrinsic mutagenic and carcinogenic activity of the fjord region dihydrodiol epoxides, our data indicate that their formation, even at a relatively low level, may contribute significantly to the biological activity of the parent hydrocarbons.",

In the present study, individual stereoisomers of the bay region diol epoxides of chrysene, dibenz[a,h]-anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene, as well as of the fjord region diol epoxides of benzo[c]phenanthrene, benzo[c]chrysene and benzo[g]chrysene, have been incubated with glutathione (GSH) in the presence or absence of human glutathione S-transferase isoenzyme GST A1-1, a class Alpha enzyme. The formation of GSH conjugates was determined and quantified by HPLC. The results demonstrate that the GST A1-1 isoenzyme catalyzes the formation of GSH conjugates of all diol epoxides tested, although a marked variation in catalytic efficiency (>20-fold) was observed. With both bay and fjord region anti-diol epoxides a significant preference for conjugation of the enantiomer with the R configuration at the benzylic position of the oxirane ring was noted. Among the syn diastereomers of the fjord region diol epoxides a similar substrate enantioselectivity was noted, i.e. the enantiomer with the corresponding R configuration was again preferentially conjugated. In contrast, for the bay region syn-diol epoxides this substrate selectivity was reversed, resulting in a preference for the enantiomer with the S configuration. The chemically more reactive syn diastereomers were in general better substrates for GST A1-1 than the corresponding anti diastereomers. However, a comparison between different diol epoxide diastereomers revealed no obvious correlation between chemical reactivity of the compounds and catalytic efficiencies. Furthermore, no significant correlation between diol epoxide lipophilicity and catalytic efficiency was observed. It is suggested that stereochemical factors, including the size and the geometry of the aromatic ring system and the preferred conformation of the diol epoxide, are involved as the major determinant for the rate of catalysis by GST A1-1.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

We have measured the formation and nucleotide excision repair of covalent DNA adducts formed by the DNA-reactive metabolite of this compound in human fibroblasts, in which expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene could be controlled by a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Cells were exposed for 1 hr to 0.01, 0.1, or 1.2 uM (+/-)-anti-benzo(g)chrysene diol-epoxide, and DNA adducts were assessed at various post-treatment times by subjecting isolated DNA to (32)P-postlabeling analysis. Four major DNA adducts were detected, corresponding to the reaction of either the (+)- or (-)-anti-benzo(g)chrysene diol-epoxide stereoisomer with adenine or guanine. Treatment with 1.2 uM resulted in a level of 1100 total adducts/10(8) nucleotides for both p53-proficient and -deficient cells; removal of adducts was not observed in either case. In cells treated with 0.1 uM, the maximum level of total adducts at 24 hr was 150/10(8) nucleotides in p53-proficient cells and 210 adducts/10(8) nucleotides in p53-deficient cells. A concentration of 0.01 microM resulted in a maximum of 20 adducts/10(8) nucleotides in p53-proficient cells at 4 hr, but 40 adducts/10(8) nucleotides persisted in p53-deficient cells at 24 hr. Whereas there were clear differences in the time course of adduct levels in p53-proficient compared with p53-deficient cells treated with 0.1 uM or 0.01 uM, these levels did not decrease extensively over 3 days. This is likely because of the stabilization of the diol-epoxide in cells, and consequent exposure and formation of adducts for many hours after the initial treatment. Furthermore, despite minor quantitative differences, all 4 of the adducts behaved similarly with respect to the effect of p53 expression on their removal. p53 appears to minimize the appearance of benzo(g)chrysene adducts in human cells by up-regulating global nucleotide excision repair and reducing the maximum adduct levels achieved. The fact that this p53-dependent effect is noted at levels of DNA adducts that are commonly found in human tissues (i.e., <100 adducts/10(8) nucleotides) because of environmental factors such as smoking is particularly significant with respect to human carcinogenesis related to environmental exposure. /(+/-)-Anti-benzo(g)chrysene diol-epoxide, metabolite/",

Metabolically activated diol epoxides of these compounds, including benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (B[a]PDE), have been suggested as causative agents in the development of lung cancer. We previously mapped the distribution of B[a]PDE adducts within the p53 tumor suppressor gene (also known as TP53), which is mutated in 60% of human lung cancers, and found that B[a]PDE adducts preferentially form at lung cancer mutational hotspots (codons 154, 157, 158, 245, 248, and 273). Other PAHs may be important in lung cancer as well. Here we have mapped the distribution of adducts induced by diol epoxides of additional PAHs: chrysene (CDE), 5-methylchrysene (5-MCDE), 6-methylchrysene (6-MCDE), benzo[c]phenanthrene (B[c]PDE), and benzo[g]chrysene (B[g]CDE) within exons 5, 7, and 8 of the p53 gene in human bronchial epithelial cells. CDE exposure produced only low levels of adducts. Exposure of cells to the other activated PAHs resulted in DNA damage patterns similar to those previously observed with B[a]PDE but with some distinct differences. 5-MCDE, 6-MCDE, B[g]CDE, and B[c]PDE efficiently induced adducts at guanines within codons 154, 156, 157, 158, and 159 of exon 5, codons 237, 245 and 248 of exon 7, and codon 273 of exon 8, but the relative levels of adducts at each site varied for each compound. B[g]CDE, B[c]PDE, and 5-MCDE induced damage at codon 158 more selectively than 6-MCDE or B[a]PDE. The sites most strongly involved in PAH adduct formation were also the sites of highest mutation frequency (codons 157, 158, 245, 248, and 273). The data suggest that PAHs contribute to the mutational spectrum in human lung cancer.",

These compounds are metabolized to diol epoxides that react to form DNA adducts. Nucleotide excision repair is a critical cellular defense against these bulky DNA adducts which, if not repaired, can lead to mutations and the initiation of cancer. The structural features of the PAH-adducts play a role in differential repair of these adducts by the global genomic repair subpathway of nucleotide excision repair. DNA adducts derived from the PAHs containing bay-regions are repaired more rapidly than adducts derived from PAHs containing fjord-regions. We have employed the host cell reactivation assay to examine the rate of repair of these adducts in an actively transcribing gene. The pGL3 plasmid containing a luciferase gene was damaged with diol epoxides of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P-DE), dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P-DE), benzo[g]chrysene (B[g]Ch-DE), and benzo[c]phenanthrene (B[c]Ph-DE). The plasmids were transfected into B-lymphocytes with normal repair capacity as well as lymphocytes derived from patients with the XP-A, XP-C and CS-B syndromes. We found that XPA cells were able to transcribe slowly past B[g]Ch-adducts but not the other PAHs. Using the amount of luciferase produced as a measure of DNA repair, we found that the relative rates of repair in the actively transcribing luciferase gene was B[a]P-DE>DB[a,l]P-DE, B[g]Ch-DE, >B[c]Ph-DE in repair proficient and XP-C cells. These results indicate that the abilities to transcribe past and to repair the PAH adducts are dependent on different structural features of the DNA adducts.",

Male Parkes mice were treated topically with 0.5 umol B[g]C and DNA was isolated from the treated areas of skin at various times after treatment and analyzed by 32P-post-labelling. Seven major adduct spots were detected, at a maximum level of 6.55 fmol adducts/ug DNA. Mouse skin treated with the PAH benzo[c]phenanthrene (B[c]Ph) gave a total of 0.24 fmol adducts/ug DNA. B[g]C-DNA adducts persisted in skin for at least 3 weeks. Treatment of mice with 0.5 umol of the optically pure putative proximate carcinogens, the (+)- and (-)-trans benzo[g]chrysene-11,12-dihydrodiols, led to the formation of adducts which comigrated on TLC and HPLC with those formed in B[g]C-treated mice, which suggested that the detected adducts were formed by the fjord region B[g]C-11,12-dihydrodiol-13,14-epoxides (B[g]CDEs). To test this, the four optically pure synthetic B[g]CDEs were reacted in vitro with DNA and the heteroco-polymers poly(dA x dT) and poly(dG x dC) and these samples 32P-postlabelled. Co-chromatography, on both TLC and HPLC, of in vitro and in vivo adducts indicated that B[g]C is activated in mouse skin through formation of the (-)-anti-(11R,12S,l3S,14R) and (+)-syn-(11S,12R,13S,14R) B[g]CDEs. (-)-anti-B[g]CDE formed five adducts with DNA, two of them with adenine and three with guanine bases. (+)-syn-B[g]CDE formed one adduct with each of these bases in DNA. The adenine adducts accounted for 64% of the total major adducts formed in B[g]C-treated mouse skin. The route of metabolic activation or B[g]C is similar to that reported for B[c]Ph, but the extent of activation to the fjord region diol-epoxides is significantly greater in the case of B[g]C, as demonstrated by the higher levels of adduct formation in vivo.",

The frequency of induction of 6-thioguanine-resistant mutations was determined, and the extent of formation of DNA adducts was measured by 32P-postlabelling. When expressed as mutation frequency per nanomoles compound per millilitre incubation medium, this group of chemicals expressed a 160-fold range in potency. In agreement with previous experimental studies, the anti-diol-epoxide of BcC was highly mutagenic, inducing in excess of 3 x 10(4) mutations/10(6) cells per nmol compound/ml. The mutagenic activities of the anti- and syn-diol-epoxides of BP were 10- and 100-fold lower, respectively. Both diol-epoxides of BgC, the syn-BcC and the anti-BcPh derivatives were also highly mutagenic, and only the syn-BcPh diol-epoxide was less mutagenic than the anti-diol-epoxide of BP. Determination of the levels of DNA adducts formed by the diol-epoxides indicated that the most mutagenic compounds were the most DNA reactive, although the fjord-region diol-epoxides gave rise to more complex patterns of adducts than those of the BP diol-epoxides. When the mutagenicity results were expressed as mutations per femtomoles total adducts formed, all compounds showed similar activities. Thus the potent mutagenicity of the fjord region diol-epoxides appears to be due to the high frequency with which they form DNA adducts in V79 cells, rather than to formation of adducts with greater mutagenic potential.",

In order to achieve these objectives, precision-cut rat liver slices were incubated with a range of concentrations of seven 5-ring isomeric PAHs, namely benzo[c]chrysene, benzo[b]chrysene, benzo[g]chrysene, dibenzo[a,j]anthracene, dibenzo[a,c]anthracene, picene and pentacene, for 24 hr. All compounds, with the exception of pentacene, elevated the O-deethylation of ethoxyresorufin, an activity associated with CYP1A1; induction of this enzyme by the various PAHs correlated with their avidity for the Ah receptor. None of the PAHs studied increased epoxide hydrolase activity, monitored using benzo[a]pyrene 4,5-oxide. Of the seven PAHs, only benzo[g]chrysene elevated glutathione S-transferase activity, measured using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene or 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole as substrates. No relationship could be established between length or length/width and interaction with the Ah receptor and CYP1A1 up-regulation indicating that other structural or electronic factors are likely to be more important. Finally, 5-ring PAHs are poor inducers of the epoxide hydrolase and glutathione S-transferase enzyme systems.",

Although benzo[g]chrysene (BgChry) and dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DBahA) have been for a long time studied as genotoxic, tumor-initiating compounds, little is known about the potential tumor-promoting effects of this group of PAHs. In the present study, we investigated their impact on activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), induction of enzymes involved in metabolic activation of PAHs, disruption of cell cycle control in confluent cell population and inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), using the rat liver epithelial cell line WB-F344 as a model of liver progenitor cells. We found that BgChry was the weakest inducer of the AhR-mediated activity, while relative potencies of benzo[b]chrysene (BbChry) and benzo[c]chrysene (BcChry) were comparable to the previously reported values for dibenzanthracenes. All compounds increased expression of cytochromes P450 1A1 and 1B1, and aldo-keto reductase 1C9. BgChry was found to induce high amounts of DNA adducts, which corresponded with induction of p53 phosphorylation at Ser15, apoptosis and accumulation of cells in S-phase of cell cycle, leading to a decrease in cell numbers. All other compounds were found to stimulate cell proliferation in contact-inhibited WB-F344 cells in a dose-dependent manner. We found that only BgChry, and to a lesser extent also BcChry, inhibited GJIC at high concentrations. Taken together, dibenzanthracenes and benzochrysenes, with exception of BgChry, seem to act primarily through deregulation of cell proliferation in liver epithelial cells, which is related to their relatively high AhR-mediated activity. The disruption of cell cycle control might contribute to their carcinogenic effects, as well as to carcinogenicity of complex environmental mixtures containing high levels of PAHs with molecular weight 278.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.0X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzo(g)chrysene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzo(g)chrysene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.2 days. Particulate-phase benzo(g)chrysene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benzo(g)chrysene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzo(g)chrysene is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 2.0X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Benzo(g)chrysene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. In general, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with four or more benzene rings do not biodegrade readily. If released into water, benzo(g)chrysene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 1.2X10+4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. However benzo(g)chrysene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to benzo(g)chrysene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzo(g)chrysene is produced as a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzo(g)chrysene via smoking, inhalation of air and dermal contact with particulate matter resulting from combustion.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 1.2X10+4(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 6.70(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Benzo(g)chrysene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(6). In general, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs) with four or more benzene rings do not biodegrade readily(7).",

Vapor-phase benzo(g)chrysene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.2 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase benzo(g)chrysene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Benzo(g)chrysene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

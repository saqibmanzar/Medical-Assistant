ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is evaluating the toxicity and carcinogenicity of DMPT in male and female Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. To aid in the design and interpretation of those studies, we have investigated the excretion and tissue distribution of oral and intravenous (IV) doses of radiolabeled DMPT in these strains of rodents. A single low (2.5 mg/kg), mid (25 mg/kg) or high (250 mg/kg) dose of carbon-14 labeled DMPT was administered. Excreta collected for up to 72 hr after dosing and tissues collected at sacrifice were analyzed for total radioactivity. Early studies were terminated at 72 hr. After a low IV dose to male rats ~100% of the dose was excreted and <2% was recovered in tissues at 72 hr. The high oral dose was acutely toxic to male mice. The same oral dose was not overtly toxic to male rats, and by 72 hr 86% of the dose was excreted and 2% remained in tissues. Subsequent studies were terminated at 24 hr to better understand the tissue distribution of radioactivity at earlier time points, which are more relevant to the interpretation of repeated dose toxicity studies. After the high oral dose to male rats ~18% of the dose was recovered in tissues and ~72% was excreted by 24 hr. In contrast, at the low and mid doses most of the radioactivity (~83-100%) was excreted by 24 hr and <5% remained in tissues. In summary, DMPT derived radioactivity was rapidly excreted by rats and mice after a single oral or IV dose and no striking sex differences in DMPT disposition were observed within a species. However, dose dependent differences in toxicity and disposition were observed. These data will be used to aid in the interpretation of safety/toxicity studies of DMPT conducted by the NTP.",

Human exposure to DMPT has resulted in methemoglobinemia and allergic responses; suspected from the formation of a toxic metabolite, p methylphenylhydroxylamine, an analog of the aniline metabolite phenylhydroxlyamine (thought to be responsible for methemoglobinemia from aniline exposure). ...results of disposition studies of DMPT in Fisher 344 (F344) rats and B6C3F1 mice after oral administration of [(14)C]DMPT /were previously reported/. The majority of [(14)C]DMPT-derived radioactivity was excreted in urine by 24 hours. /This study/ report on the metabolism of orally administered DMPT. The profile of radiolabeled metabolites was determined by liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C18 stationary phase and a mobile phase that transitioned from mostly water (polar) to mostly organic (neutral). The same four radiolabeled chromatographic peaks were observed in both rats and mice. Due to the limited volume of mouse urine, further work to elucidate the DMPT metabolite structures was performed with rat urine only. All four peaks have been isolated and preliminary structural elucidation by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and comparison to authentic standards confirmed excretion of the parent compound. We have tentatively identified a second peak by GC/MS as N-methyl-p-toluidine. A third peak had different HPLC and GC retention times than DMPT but an identical electron impact mass spectrum. Attempts at preliminary identification of the most polar metabolite have been unsuccessful. Further purification coupled with infrared and nuclear magenetic resonance spectroscopy will be employed along with incubation of isolated metabolites with glucuronidase and sulfatase enzymes (to assess conjugation) to complete structural elucidation/confirmation",

The rat urinary metabolite profile was determined by analytical reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Four radiolabeled peaks were observed, isolated, and purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and preparative HPLC methods. The 4 peaks were identified as p-(N-acetylhydroxyamino)hippuric acid (M1), DMPT N-oxide (M2), N-methyl-p-toluidine (M3), and parent DMPT. Metabolites M1 and M2 were identified by spectrometric and spectroscopic methods, including mass fragmentation pattern identification from both liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and from chemical analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Structural confirmation of metabolite M2 was accomplished by comparison with a synthetic standard. Peaks M3 and the peak suspected to be DMPT were identified by comparison of their HPLC retention times and mass fragmentation patterns with authentic standards of N-methyl-p-toluidine and DMPT, respectively. DMPT metabolism is similar to that reported for N,N-dimethylaniline.",

Differences were noticed among the cements; residual DMPT is higher in cements prepared with higher content of the amine. It is verified that DMPT's toxic effect on cell cultures is dose-related; a delay in the cell replication cycle is induced in vitro.

Two pMMA composite resins, Yunifast and Acron, were analyzed. Yunifast was polymerized at room temperature, and Acron at 100 degrees-C. Each sample was then placed in equine serum at room temperature, and serum was replaced daily. The serum extract was subjected to SPE and HPLC, for methyl-methacrylate, N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine (DMPT), and benzoylperoxide (BPO) (initiator and stimulator for the polymerization) analysis. Results showed that the MMA and DMPT eluted was in the order of 10 to 100 parts per million. Almost negligible amounts of BPO and benzoic-acid were also eluted. A greater amount of these compounds was eluted from Yunifast, a more pliant material. DMPT showed greater elution than MMA. The hydrophilic portion of Yunifast was more cytotoxic than the hydrophobic portion, and contained BA and p-toluidine as major and minor components. The /study/ conclude that the rigidity of the material is critical to the extractable quantity, and recommend that both Yunifast and Acron be immersed in hot water before use in order to remove hydrophilic toxic compounds from these pMMA dental materials.",

Dimethyl-4-toluidine is an accelerator in the redox initiator-accelerator system used commercially to cure methyl methacrylate monomers. It is a high-production volume chemical with potential for widespread human exposure through its use in dental materials and bone cements. Dimethyl-4-toluidine has been used in the preparation of acrylic denture materials for the past 50 years. It is used as the accelerator for the cement in most of the hip and bone replacements to activate the polymerization reaction. Dimethyl-4-toluidine is found in industrial glues and artificial fingernail preparations and is used as an intermediate in dye and pesticide synthesis.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Toxic by skin absorption and inhalation. Short-term exposure effects are mostly hematotoxic (methemoglobinemia causing cyanosis, brain damage and renal insufficiency) and may be delayed. Exposure to high concentrations may lead to death. An acute cyanotic episode due to methemoglobinemia occurred in a 16-month old girl following the ingestion of dimethyl-4-toluidine (6 mg/kg of body weight ) used in the production of artificial fingernails. Administration of methylene blue was effective in the reversal of the methemoglobinemia. In vitro studies suggest that the activity of the compound was probably due to its biochemical transformation to the toxic metabolite p-methylphenylhydroxylamine. There is potential for widespread human exposure to dimethyl-4-toluidine in occupational settings where bone cements, dental prostheses, industrial glues, and artificial fingernails are manufactured or used. Exposure to dimethyl-4-toluidine may be a concern because of the possible release of unreacted chemicals from polymeric composites. \"Sniffing\" glue is one possible means of exposure to dimethyl-4-toluidine. Contact allergy to dimethyl-4-toluidine was reported in 3 cases among 22 patients with the burning mouth syndrome who wore complete or partial dentures. ANIMAL STUDIES: Under the conditions of the NTP 2-year oral gavage studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of dimethyl-4-toluidine in rats based on increased incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in male and female rats, and increased incidences of nasal cavity neoplasms (primarily nasal cavity transitional epithelium adenoma) in male rats. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of dimethyl-4-toluidine in mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma (multiple), hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatoblastoma in male and female mice, and increased incidences of alveolar/ bronchiolar neoplasms (primarily adenoma)in female mice. Administration of dimethyl-4-toluidine resulted in increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the liver and nasal cavity in male and female rats and mice; the kidney in male and female rats; the spleen and bone marrow in male and female rats and female mice; the lung in male and female mice; the forestomach in male rats and female mice; the mesenteric lymph node in male rats and female mice; and the olfactory lobe in male and female mice. Dimethyl-4-toluidine also caused hematologic toxicity and increases in methemoglobin levels in male and female rats and mice (as measured at 3 months). Dimethyl-4-toluidine was tested in two independent bacterial gene mutation studies; both studies gave negative results in S. typhimurium or E. coli tester strains, with and without exogenous metabolic activation. No significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were observed in peripheral blood of male or female mice treated with dimethyl-4-toluidine by gavage for 3 months. Furthermore, no increases in micronucleated reticulocytes were observed in male mice treated with dimethyl-4-toluidine for 4 days. Results of DNA damage (comet) studies yielded mixed results. No increases in DNA damage (measured as percent tail DNA) were seen in liver cells or blood leukocytes of male mice administered dimethyl-4-toluidine by gavage once daily for 4 days. However, a small but significant increase in DNA damage was seen in liver cells of male rats administered 60 mg/kg dimethyl-4-toluidine once daily for 4 days.  It was also tested for structural and numerical chromosome aberrations in hamster V79 cells (micronucleus test, matched with an immunofluorescent staining for kinetochore proteins), and in vivo DNA damage in mouse and rat liver (alkaline DNA elution test). The results essentially indicate that the chemical is a chromosome damaging agent.",

CQ is also characterized as a potential allergenic compound. To date, there is growing concern that CQ may produce genetic damage by inducing mutation. In this study, CQ in the presence of reducing agent N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine (DMT) with or without VL irradiation was analyzed for the induction of chromosomal aberrations indicated by micronuclei (MN) induced in CHO cells. /The/ data demonstrated that an increase in the numbers of MN was observed with CQ/DMT with or without VL irradiation (p < 0.05). Significant prolongation of cell cycles was observed by the treatment with CQ/DMT with or without VL irradiation (p < 0.05). In addition, VL irradiated CQ/DMT was found to exhibit significantly genotoxic and cytotoxic effects as compared with CQ/DMT alone (p < 0.05). Furthermore, to determine whether oxidative stress could modulate the MN induced by CQ/DMT with or without VL irradiation in CHO cells, cells were pre-treated with various antioxidants 10 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), 2 mM ascorbic acid, and 2 mM alpha-tocopherol. The pre-treatment with antioxidants could antagonize not only the increased MN cells but also the prolonged cell cycle induced by CQ/DMT with or without VL irradiation in CHO cells (p < 0.05). /These/ findings provide the evidences for the induction of MN by CQ/DMT employing mammalian test system, indicating clastogenic activity of CQ/DMT with or without VL irradiation in vitro. In addition, VL irradiated CQ/DMT exhibits higher genotoxic and cytotoxic effects than CQ/DMT alone.

Blue light (400-500nm) is used to activate camphoroquinone (CQ), which decomposes to form free radicals that are stabilized by dimethyl-p-toludine (DMPT). CQ and DMPT are applied near tooth pulpal tissues and are irradiated during restorative procedures, suggesting that pulpal cells are exposed to free radicals. Because glutathione is a major component of the cellular redox management system, /the study/ tested the hypothesis that blue light irradiation would shift cellular glutathione redox balance of cells exposed to CQ and DMPT. /The study/ also measured NFkappaB activation, a redox-sensitive transcription factor that regulates inflammatory responses and glutathione synthetic enzyme levels. THP1 human monocytes were exposed to sublethal levels of CQ (0.4 mM) or DMPT (1.0 mM), with or without blue light exposure (25 J/sq cm) from a quartz-tungsten-halogen source. The ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione was measured using as assay based on 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenszoic acid). NFkappaB transactivation was measured by transfection of an NFkappaB-containing plasmid linked to a luciferase reporter. Our results showed that blue light, CQ, or DMPT alone had no significant effect on cellular glutathione redox balance, but that the combination of these agents induced a marked oxidative bias, and reduced total glutathione levels up to 50%. On the other hand, light, CQ, and DMPT alone or in combination suppressed NFkappaB transactivation by >70%. Our results suggest that CQ and DMPT pose risks to pulpal tissues with or without blue light irradiation, and that multiple, interacting mechanisms shape the response to these agents.",

Apart from psychologic factors, several etiologic \"somatic\" factors have been reported.  In 22 patients (19 women, 3 men, mean age 56 years) classified with BMS, clinical and laboratory investigations were performed, with particular emphasis on the role of contact hypersensitivity. Twenty of the 22 patients wore a complete or partial denture.  Besides clinical and laboratory investigations patch testing was performed with a standard routine series and a standardized denture-dental (acrylate and metal) series.  Folate, iron, pyridoxine deficiency, and Candida infections were found, but correction of the deficiency or treatment of the infection was of no benefit. Contact allergy to allergens used in the production of acrylate-based dentures was observed in six (27%) of the cases (all wore a denture); positive reactions were seen to N,N,-dimethyl-4-toluidine (3 cases), to 4-tolyldiethanolamine (2 cases), to benzoylperoxide (2 cases), and to oligotriacrylate (1 case). In six cases (27%) a possible relevant sensitization was seen to dental metals and in particular to gold chloride (four cases).",

The amount of the parent compound ingested was about 6 mg/kg of body weight. Administration of methylene blue was effective in the reversal of the methemoglobinemia. In vitro studies suggest that the activity of the compound was probably due to its biochemical transformation to the toxic metabolite p-methylphenylhydroxylamine. /The study/ expand the list of aromatic amino or nitro compounds and their derivatives capable of producing methemoglobinemia and call attention to the hazard of their ingestion.",

There is potential for human exposure to DMPT. The disposition of oral and intravenous (i.v.) doses of [(14)C]DMPT in F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice was investigated. A single i.v. (2.5 mg/kg) or oral (2.5, 25, or 250 mg/kg) dose of [(14)C]DMPT (1-25 uCi) was administered in an aqueous vehicle to male rats and mice. The 25-mg/kg oral dose was administered to females to investigate possible gender differences in disposition. However, no striking gender differences were observed. Since toxicity studies conducted elsewhere used a corn oil vehicle, the 250-mg/kg oral dose also was administered in corn oil to male rats; disposition was not dependent on vehicle. Excreta (through 24 hr) and tissues collected at sacrifice were analyzed for total radioactivity. Dose-dependent differences in toxicity and disposition were observed. Toxicity at the 250-mg/kg oral dose to male mice was consistent with acute renal failure. At the same dose, male rats exhibited clinical signs of toxicity through 12 hr but were clinically normal by 24 hr. At lower oral doses, [(14)C]DMPT-derived radioactivity was well absorbed and rapidly excreted, primarily in urine.",

Tissue reaction to 3 MMA monomers was studied by injecting the ears of 16 adult male rabbits; the material was studied by microangiograms. No difference in the acute local toxicity between CMW, Simplex-P and pure MMA monomer was seen. By gas chromatography, N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine was shown to be water soluble to a small extent. Any bone cement monomer in current use can be fully dissolved in saline to a concentration of about 1%.",

Additional groups of 10 male and 10 female rats (clinical pathology study) were administered the same doses, 5 days per week for 25 days. On day 88, blood was collected from core study rats for hemoglobin and methemoglobin analyses only. All 1,000 mg/kg male and female rats and one 500 mg/kg male rat died by study day 3. Mean body weights of all surviving dosed groups of males and females were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. Clinical findings associated with exposure to N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine included cyanosis, abnormal breathing, and lethargy in groups administered 250 mg/kg or greater. Methemoglobinemia appeared to be the primary hematologic toxic response, and many other lesions could be explained as secondary to methemoglobin formation including Heinz body formation; a macrocytic, hypochromic, responsive anemia; and increased hematopoietic cell proliferation in the spleen and bone marrow. In general, hematologic changes were dose-related and occurred at both evaluated timepoints in all dosed groups. Anemia was evidenced by decreases in hematocrit values, hemoglobin concentrations, and erythrocyte counts; erythrocyte macrocytosis was characterized by increases in mean cell volume and mean cell hemo-globin values; erythrocyte hypochromia was evidenced by decreases in mean cell hemoglobin concentration values; and an erythropoietic response to the anemia was characterized by substantially increased reticulocyte and nucleated erythrocyte counts. Liver weights of all surviving dosed groups of males and females were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Kidney weights of all surviving dosed groups of females were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. There were significant decreases in left cauda epididymis and left epididymis weights in 250 mg/kg males. There was a dose-related decrease in the number of cycling females, with only four females in the 250 mg/kg group having regular cycles and females in the 125 and 250 mg/kg groups spending a significantly higher proportion of time in extended diestrus compared to the vehicle control group. In the surviving groups of rats, there were significantly increased incidences of pigmentation in the liver of all dosed groups, hepatocyte hypertrophy in groups administered 125 mg/kg or greater, and hepatocyte necrosis in 62.5, 250, and 500 mg/kg females. In the olfactory epithelium of the nose, there were dose-related increases in the incidences and severities of degeneration in all dosed groups and significantly increased incidences of metaplasia in the 250 and 500 mg/kg groups. In the respiratory epithelium of the nose, there were significantly increased incidences of hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia in all of the groups administered 125 mg/kg or greater. The incidences of glandular hyperplasia of the nose were significantly increased in males and females administered 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg. In the spleen, there were significantly increased incidences of capsule fibrosis, congestion, mesothelial hypertrophy, and lymphoid follicle atrophy primarily in groups administered 125 mg/kg or greater. Hematopoietic cell proliferation and pigmentation were increased in severity in treated groups. In the kidney, there were significantly increased incidences of nephropathy (females), pigmentation (males and females), papillary necrosis (males and females), and mineralization (males). Other treatment-related lesions included inflammation of the forestomach in males, mesenteric lymph node atrophy in females, and bone marrow hyperplasia in males and females.",

Additional groups of 10 male and 10 female rats (clinical pathology study) were administered the same doses for 86 days. Survival of 60 mg/kg males was significantly less than that of the vehicle controls. Mean body weights of 60 mg/kg males and females were more than 10% less than those of the vehicle controls after week 61 and week 33, respectively. Clinical findings included signs of pallor in 60 mg/kg females and hyperactivity and boxing behavior in 20 mg/kg females and 60 mg/kg males and females. The hematology findings at the 3-month timepoint were consistent with those in the 3-month study in rats which indicated that methemoglobinemia was the primary hematologic toxic response. In the 20 and 60 mg/kg groups, there were dose-related decreases in hematocrit values, hemoglobin concentrations, and erythrocyte counts. There were similar trends toward erythrocyte macrocytosis and hypochromia and increased erythropoiesis as seen in the 3-month study. While the magnitudes of the erythron decreases were not sufficient to classify the responses as anemias, the patterns of the erythron changes were identical to those in the 3-month study. In the liver of 60 mg/kg males and females, there were significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular car-cinoma and hepatocellular adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma (combined). Numerous nonneoplastic liver lesions occurred in dosed males and females primarily in the 20 and 60 mg/kg groups. In the nose, there were significantly increased incidences of transitional epithelium adenoma and transi-tional epithelium adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 60 mg/kg males; transitional epithelium adenoma also occurred in female rats administered 6 or 60 mg/kg. In the nose, there were significantly increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions in the olfactory, respiratory, and transitional epithelia of dosed rats. These lesions occurred with the greatest incidence and severity in the 60 mg/kg groups. The incidences of inflammation and nerve atrophy were significantly increased in males and females administered 60 mg/kg. There were increased incidences of follicular cell ade-noma or carcinoma (combined) of the thyroid gland in all dosed groups of males, and an increased incidence of follicular cell adenoma in 20 mg/kg females. In the spleen, there were significantly increased incidences of hematopoietic cell proliferation in all dosed groups of males and females. The incidences of congestion and mesothelial hypertrophy of the capsule were significantly increased in 60 mg/kg males and all dosed groups of females. There were also significantly increased incidences of capsular fibrosis and atrophy of the lymphoid follicle in the 60 mg/kg groups. The incidences of pigmentation were significantly increased in all dosed groups of males and in 60 mg/kg females. In all dosed groups of female rats, there were signifi-cantly increased incidences of nephropathy. Although the incidences of this lesion were not significantly increased in dosed males, the severities increased with increasing dose in both males and females. The incidences of pigmentation of the kidney were significantly increased in all dosed groups of males and in 60 mg/kg females. In the forestomach of males, there were significantly increased incidences of hyperplasia and ulcer in the 20 and 60 mg/kg groups and inflammation in the 60 mg/kg group. In the bone marrow of 20 and 60 mg/kg males and 60 mg/kg females, there were significantly increased incidences of hyperplasia. In the mesenteric lymph node of 20 and 60 mg/kg males, there were significantly increased incidences of histiocytic cellular infiltrates.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.178 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dimethyl-4-toluidine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dimethyl-4-toluidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hrs. Dimethyl-4-toluidine does not contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dimethyl-4-toluidine is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 260. The pKa of dimethyl-4-toluidine is 5.63, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.0X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Dimethyl-4-toluidine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, dimethyl-4-toluidine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 and 10 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 33 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to dimethyl-4-toluidine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimethyl-4-toluidine is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that dimethyl-4-toluidine is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 1 day(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 10 days(SRC). Dimethyl-4-toluidine's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Dimethyl-4-toluidine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

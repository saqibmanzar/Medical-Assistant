PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Peroxide formation can be initiated by exposure to air, self-polymerization, or solvent impurities. Once formed, organic peroxides are sensitive to thermal or mechanical shock and can be violently explosive in concentrated solutions or as solids.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.3X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bis(2-methoxyethyl) phthalate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase bis(2-methoxyethyl) phthalate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 hours. Bis(2-methoxyethyl) phthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, bis(2-methoxyethyl) phthalate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 38. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-13 atm-cu m/mole. Bis(2-methoxyethyl) phthalate was biodegraded 19.3% using an enzyme extract, suggesting that bis(2-methoxyethyl) phthalate may be susceptible to biodegradation. If released into water, bis(2-methoxyethyl) phthalate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 1.4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 1.3 years and 49 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to bis(2-methoxyethyl) phthalate may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bis(2-methoxyethyl) phthalate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

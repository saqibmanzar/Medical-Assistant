PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

It is one of the most frequently prescribed aminoglycosides due to its spectrum of activity, low cost, and availability. Gentamicin is effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms but is particularly useful for the treatment of severe gram-negative infections including those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There is the added benefit of synergy when gentamicin is co-administered with other antibacterials such as beta-lactams. This synergistic activity is not only important for the treatment of complex infections, but can also contribute to dose optimization and reduced adverse effects.  Although gentamicin is well-established and may be used in a variety of clinical applications, it is also associated with severe adverse effects including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity which may limit its use.",

Specifically, this antibiotic is lodged between 16S rRNA and S12 protein within the 30S subunit. This leads to interference with translational initiation complex, misreading of mRNA, thereby hampering protein synthesis and resulting in bactericidal effect.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

As with other aminoglycosides, Gentamicin Injection is potentially nephrotoxic. The risk of nephrotoxicity is greater in patients with impaired renal function and in those who receive high dosage or prolonged therapy. Neurotoxicity manifested by ototoxicity, both vestibular and auditory, can occur in patients treated with gentamicin, primarily in those with pre-existing renal damage and in patients with normal renal function treated with higher doses and/or for longer periods than recommended. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is usually irreversible.  Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching and convulsions. Renal and eighth cranial nerve function should be closely monitored, especially in patients with known or suspected reduced renal function at onset of therapy, and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity, increased excretion of protein, and the presence of cells or casts.  Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, or creatinine clearance should be determined periodically.  When feasible, it is recommended that serial audiograms be obtained in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of ototoxicity (dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears or hearing loss) or nephrotoxicity requires dosage adjustment or discontinuance of the drug. As with the other aminoglycosides, on rare occasions changes in renal and eighth cranial nerve function may not become manifest until soon after completion of therapy. Serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored when feasible to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. When monitoring gentamicin peak concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 ug/mL are avoided. When monitoring gentamicin trough concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 ug/mL are avoided. Excessive peak and/or trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides may increase the risk of renal and eighth cranial nerve toxicity.  In the event of overdose or toxic reactions, hemodialysis may aid in the removal of gentamicin from the blood, especially if renal function is, or becomes, compromised. The rate of removal of gentamicin is considerably less by peritoneal dialysis than by hemodialysis. In the newborn infant, exchange transfusions may also be considered. Concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs, such as cisplatin, cephaloridine, kanamycin, amikacin, neomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, vancomycin, and viomycin, should be avoided. Other factors which may increase patient risk of toxicity are advanced age and dehydration. The concurrent use of gentamicin with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid or furosemide, should be avoided, since certain diuretics by themselves may cause ototoxicity.  In addition, when administered intravenously, diuretics may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering the antibiotic concentration in serum and tissue. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

                                            "String": "There are 3 key phases of aminoglycoside entry into cells. The first \u201cionic binding phase\u201d occurs when polycationic aminoglycosides bind electrostatically to negatively charged components of bacterial cell membranes including with lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids within the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and to teichoic acids and phospholipids within the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry. The second \u201cenergy-dependent phase I\u201d of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome. This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. Finally, in the \u201cenergy-dependent phase II\u201d stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified. The necessity of oxygen-dependent active transport explains why aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria. Hence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model. Inhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site. Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling. Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit. Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation. Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.",

Gentamicin is widely used in the treatment of severe infections.  It is active against many strains of Gram-negative bacteria and Streptococus aureus. It is inactive against anaerobes and poorly active against Streptococus hemolyticus and Pneumococcus. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Main risks and target organs: The main toxic effects are vestibular damage, deafness and renal dysfunction.  The damage on the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve appears to be greater than that on the cochlear portion. The main target organs are the eighth cranial nerves and the kidneys.  Damage to eighth cranial nerve (both divisions) resulting in tinnitus, deafness, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, dizziness and nystagmus, and nephrotoxicity causing acute tubular necrosis resulting in renal failure. Loss of hearing, dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, nausea, vomiting and renal impairment developing in a patient on gentamicin therapy suggests a diagnosis of gentamicin toxicity. Other toxic features are muscular paralysis and respiratory depression. As gentamicin accumulates in the renal cortex, a critical concentration is reached when the concentrating ability of the kidney becomes impaired.  Nephrotoxicity appears to be related to the duration for which the trough serum concentration exceeds 2 ug/ml. The exact mechanism of toxicity is unknown.  Ototoxicity and vestibular toxicity seem most highly correlated with elevated peak concentrations (greater than 10 ug/mL) of gentamicin.  Gentamicin accumulates in endolymph and perilymph and progressive destruction of ventricular and cochlear cells occurs.  Repeated courses of gentamicin may produce progressive destruction of cells leading to deafness.  Gentamicin appears to damage the vestibular portion more than the cochlear portion.  Neuromuscular blockade with acute muscular paralysis and apnea may occur rarely. Most episodes have occurred in association with anesthesia or administration of other neuromuscular blockers but may also occur after intrapleural or intraperitoneal instillation of large doses of gentamicin or other aminoglycosides.  This phenomenon may occur after intravenous or intramuscular administration. ANIMAL STUDIES: Clinical signs of intoxication in rodents included convulsions, prostration, hypoactivity, polydipsia, dyspnoea and ataxia. Dogs exhibited muscle tremors, salivation, and anorexia.  Histopathological examination of kidneys from dogs that died up to 13 days after dosing revealed necrosis of the proximal convoluted tubule. Groups of 3 female Rhesus monkeys were injected i.m. with doses of 0, 6 or 30 mg/kg bw/day gentamicin in an aqueous vehicle for 3 weeks.  Adverse clinical signs were limited to the 30 mg/kg bw/day group, which included pronounced facial paling and ptosis, markedly disturbed equilibrium from day 20, and depressed food intake and body- weight gain from week 2 onwards. Electron microscopy of renal tubules from the 30 mg/kg bw/day monkeys revealed myeloid bodies present in both tubular cells and lumen, increased phagosomes, disappearance of brush borders and sloughing of epithelial cells from the basement membrane. Groups of beagle dogs (4/sex/group) were administered oral doses of 0, 2, 10, or 60 mg/kg bw/day gentamicin in capsules for 14 weeks. Emesis and diarrhoea were observed occasionally in treated dogs. The only postmortem change was interstitial nephritis observed in 2 animals in the high-dose group. Gentamicin had negative effects on sperm parameters and testis apoptosis in rats. No treatment-related changes in pregnancy rate, litter size and weight, prenatal mortality or fetal abnormalities were reported in 2 generation study in rats. Gentamicin was tested  in vitro for its ability to induce forward gene mutation in Chinese hamster ovary cells at concentrations of 128-5000 ug/mL and chromosomal aberrations in these cells at concentrations of 800-5000 ug/mL, both with and without metabolic activation. It was also tested  in vivo for its ability to induce nuclear anomalies in mouse bone-marrow cells at intravenous doses of 20-80 mg/kg bw, the highest dose being the maximum tolerated dose. There was no indication of mutagenic activity.",

Only isolated case reports of acute liver injury with jaundice have been associated with aminoglycoside therapy including gentamicin, most of which are not very convincing. The hepatic injury described in these reports is typically mixed but can evolve into a cholestatic hepatitis. The latency to onset is rapid, occurring within 1 to 3 weeks and is typically associated with skin rash, fever and sometimes eosinophilia. Recovery typically occurs within 1 to 2 months and chronic injury has not been described. Aminoglycosides are not listed or mentioned in large case series of drug induced liver disease and acute liver failure; thus, hepatic injury due to gentamicin is rare if it occurs at all.",

Newborn infants apparently absorb small amounts of gentamicin, but their serum levels with three times daily dosages are far below those attained when treating newborn infections and systemic effects of gentamicin are unlikely. Older infants would be expected to absorb even less gentamicin. Because there is little variability in the milk gentamicin levels during multiple daily dose regimens, timing breastfeeding with respect to the dose is of little or no benefit in reducing infant exposure. Data are not available with single daily dose regimens. Monitor the infant for possible effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (e.g., thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis.",

His mother had taken many medications during pregnancy, but she did not recall their identity. She developed mastitis and was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1 gram orally every 12 hours and gentamicin 160 mg intramuscularly once daily. The infant was breastfed for 10 minutes starting 15 minutes after the first dose of both drugs. About 20 minutes later, the infant developed a generalized urticaria which disappeared after 30 minutes. A few hours later, the infant breastfed again and the urticaria reappeared after 15 minutes and disappeared after an hour. After switching to formula feeding and no further infant exposure to penicillins, the reaction did not reappear with follow-up to 16 months of age. The adverse reaction was probably caused by the antibiotics in breastmilk. The drug that caused the reaction cannot be determined, but it was most likely the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.",

Hemodialysis was initiated approximately 4 hr after gentamicin was given and stopped 4 hr later, with a serum gentamicin level of 3.4 mg/L. Gentamicin level 4 hr after completion of hemodialysis was 2.3 mg/L. Three months later, the child's serum creatinine was 0.3 mg/dL, urinalysis showed no blood or protein, and audiometry showed normal hearing bilaterally at all frequencies. This child demonstrated the highest gentamicin level recorded in a patient with normal renal function.

A high dose of gentamicin (10 mg/kg) is required to reach sufficient concentrations in specific fluids as cerebrospinal fluid and to be effective on antibiotics resistant bacteria as well as treatment of acute and dangerous illness. Using a rat model, the renal toxicity and oxidative stress of administering gentamicin (10 mg/kg) daily for 7 days) either in a single dose or divided into 2 doses was investigated. The safety of dose regimens was assessed through oxidant-antioxidant parameters as well as renal function tests. Typical renal damage and high oxidative stress were evident in the control group receiving 100 mg/kg gentamicin daily for 7 days. This was verified by high serum urea, uric acid, creatinine as well as increase in the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers as malondialdehyde, NO, total antioxidant capacity and decrease in reduced glutathione level. At any of the used regimen, 10mg/kg gentamicin did not provide high compromise for renal functions nor significantly increased the oxidative stress and tissue damage. Based on microscopic lesions scores and biochemical analysis, there were no significant differences between single or two divided dosages of gentamicin at dose rate of 10 mg/kg/day.",

Total dosages administered were 10, 60, or 140 mg/kg, achieving constant serum concentrations of 3, 11, and 27 ug/mL, respectively. At the end of the 12-hr infusion, the cortical drug concentrations corresponding to the three dosages were 124, 450, and 993 ug/g of wet tissue. At the low dose (10 mg/kg), myeloid bodies were seen inside lysosomes of proximal tubular cells, along with a modest decrease of lysosomal sphingomyelinase activity. The cortical drug level declined steadily following first-order kinetics along with a disappearance of myeloid bodies and return of sphingomyelinase activity to control levels. At the high dose (140 mg/kg), we observed a sustained loss of sphingomyelinase activity (37% of controls), a subsequent increase of phospholipid concentration in the kidney cortex (up to 117% of controls 2 days after) and a prominent accumulation of myeloid bodies inside the lysosomes of proximal tubular cells (up to 4% of cell volume). Tubular regeneration and interstitial infiltration became detectable by histology and the increase of DNA synthesis as from day 1, along with an apparent reduction of the phospholipidosis at days 3 and 4. Drug cortical concentrations showed a sharp decline 2 days after infusion. An intermediate behavior was observed at 60 mg/kg. It is concluded that the proximal tubular cells behave in a fundamentally different way after gentamicin loading with low and high doses. At the low dose there is a regression of the drug-induced changes in the absence of any sign of necrosis-regeneration. Above a threshold in cortical drug concentration there is further development of the alterations leading to cell death-regeneration.",

DM rats were compared to controls (C) and nondiabetic rats ingesting the osmotic diuretic isosorbide administered to simulate glycosuric diuresis (C/I). Base-line C/I renal function and histology did not differ from C. /LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ However, in DM rats base-line inulin clearance (CIN) was 20% lower, and renal cortical slice uptake of p-aminohippurate was reduced compared to C and C/I. DM rats also had foci of renal tubular epithelial dysplasia not seen in C or C/I. Gentamicin was administered at 40 mg/kg-day to C and C/I and 32 mg/kg-day to DM rats to adjust for base-line CIN. Acute tubular necrosis, associated with depression of CIN and renal cortical p-aminohippurate and N-methylnicotinamide uptake, developed in all three groups. There were no differences between C and C/I. However, the degree of acute tubular necrosis and dysfunction was less in DM rats than C and C/I. Renal cortical gentamicin accumulation was also slower in DM than either C or C/I, and changes in renal cortical gentamicin over time followed a different pattern in DM rats. These results indicate that 1) attenuation of gentamicin injury in DM rats may be related to reduced accumulation of gentamicin by the renal cortex, 2) this reduced accumulation may be due to subtle baseline tubular injury mediated by streptozotocin or the diabetic state, and 3) osmotic diuresis does not account for attenuation of renal injury in DM.",

Particulate-phase gentamicin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Gentamicin does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, gentamicin is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. The estimated pKb of gentamicin is 9.0, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.8X10-31 atm-cu m/mole. Gentamicin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, gentamicin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to gentamicin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where gentamicin is produced or used. The general public is not likely to be exposed to gentamicin unless by direct medical treatment. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The estimated pKb of gentamicin is 9.0(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(5,6), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC).",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

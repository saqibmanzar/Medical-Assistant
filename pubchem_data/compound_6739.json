When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

After administration for 5 days, the relative liver weight was dose-dependently increased in the males in all treated groups. No effects were found at post-mortem. Functional disturbances of the liver were found in males and females after administration of 2500 ppm for 4 weeks (decrease in total protein and effects on alanine aminotransferase activity and the albumin-globulin quotient). However, no effects on liver weight or histologically detectable damage to the liver were seen.

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 0.0172 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,2-dimethyl-3-nitrobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,2-dimethyl-3-nitrobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 15 days. Methylnitrobenzenes have measurable quantum yields at 313 nm and therefore are susceptible to direct photolysis in sunlight. If released to soil, 1,2-dimethyl-3-nitrobenzene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 606. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.11X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 1,2-Dimethyl-3-nitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. However, studies of analogous 2- and 4-methylnitrobenzene have shown that biodegradation of these compounds in acclimated media can be relatively fast with 98-100% degradation within a few days to a few weeks. If released into water, 1,2-dimethyl-3-nitrobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 25 hours and 11 days, respectively. A BCF of 724 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,2-dimethyl-3-nitrobenzene may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2-dimethyl-3-nitrobenzene is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.11X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 25 hours and 11 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), a BCF of 724(5) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks(6) indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. However, studies of analogous 2- and 4-methylnitrobenzene have shown that biodegradation of these compounds in acclimated media can be relatively fast with 98-100% degradation within a few days to a few weeks(7-9).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

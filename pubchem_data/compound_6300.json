When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The duration of the study was 24 mo. Dependent parameters included total body calcium (TBCa), measured by neutron activation analysis: bone mineral content of the radius (BMC), measured by photon absorptiometry; and total body potassium (TBK), measured by total body counting. A significant increase in TBK occurred in the treated group, primarily in the first 6 mo; thereafter the TBK remained fairly constant. No significant changes in bone mass occurred, except the 6 mo TBCa measurement increased by 11 grams for the methandrostenolone group and decreased by 6 grams for the placebo group (p = .05). Other evidence also suggests that anabolic steroids may not produce sustained uncoupling of bone formation and bone resorption in osteoporosis. If methandrostenolone is capable of producing an increment in bone mass in osteoporosis, it was not readily observable with the sensitivity of the techniques employed in this study",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

GC-MS analysis indicated the major metabolic processes to be sequential reduction of the A-ring and hydroxylation at C6 and C16. In the phase II study, unconjugated, beta-glucuronidated and sulfated metabolites were fractionated and deconjugated using a combination of liquid-liquid extraction, enzyme hydrolysis, solid-phase extraction and acid catalysed methanolysis.

The microsomal fraction isolated from the transformed yeast cells was used for biotransformation of the anabolic steroid hormone-methandrostenolone. The microsomal oxidation products were analyzed by HPLC and two-dimensional TLC. It was shown that microsomes of the yeasts expressing human cytochrome P450IIIA4 catalyze the methandrostenolone conversion into its 6 beta-hydroxy derivative. An identical product is formed via a reaction catalyzed by human liver microsomes. The use of the heterological system of cytochrome P450IIIA4 expression has made it possible to establish its role in methandrostenolone metabolism. The experimental system simulates the first phase of the drug biotransformation in liver cells.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The nature of cardiac responses to androgen appear to depend on the prevailing experimental conditions. Protein synthesis was inhibited in the castrate rat and was stimulated by subsequent treatment with androgen. Under conditions of induced overgrowth of the ventricles, androgens gave rise to an attenuation of the effects of aortic constriction on ventricular mass and blood pressure involving smaller changes in protein synthesis and proteolysis. Concentrations of testosterone receptors in ventricular cytosol further indicated that the myocardium is more sensitive to androgen action during the prepubertal phase of the life-span. Changes in amount and properties of the receptors showed them to be functional and responsive to castration, aortic constriction, and administration of the androgens. The androgens affected cardiac protein balance by stimulating the incorporation of radiolabelled amino acid into protein in vivo. They also appeared to influence proteolytic processes involving lysosomal hydrolase activities, but their actions were either stimulatory or inhibitory depending on the internal environment. The heart is a target organ for several hormones including androgen, and our findings fortify the notion that hormone action needs to be investigated alone and in association with other endocrines.",

The AAS was injected six times with 1 week's interval and the rats were sacrificed 2 days after the final injection. 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), DA and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were measured. The effect on DA and 5-HT synthesis rate was analysed as the accumulation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-alanine (DOPA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), respectively, after inhibition of the amino acid decarboxylase with NSD-1015 (3-hydroxy-benzylhydrazine dihydrochloride). Additionally, the monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity was analysed in the hypothalamus. The DOPAC+HVA/DA ratio was increased in the striatum in all treatment groups. However, the synthesis rate of DA was significantly increased only in the methandrostenolone treated group. The 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was increased in all treatment groups in the hippocampus, in the frontal cortex in the methandrostenolone-treated animals and in the hypothalamus in the testosterone- and oxymetholone-treated rats, while the 5-HT synthesis rate was not affected by the AAS-treatments. The MAO-A activity was increased in the oxymetholone-treated rats while the other treatment groups were unaffected. The MAO-B activity was not changed. The results indicate that relatively high doses of AAS increase dopaminergic and 5-hydroxytryptaminergic metabolism in male rat brain, probably due to enhanced turnover in these monaminergic systems.",

These filaments, measuring 70 - 110 A in diameter, form a characteristic network at the Z-level of the sarcomere, either encircling or penetrating the Z-bands, and appear to insert into the nuclear membrane. The T-system is accompanied by the filaments adjacent to the site of the couplings. Here they are attached to subsarcolemmal electron-dense patches, which may be Z-line precursor material. The filaments may function as a cytoskeleton, to provide passive support in the mechanism of contraction and to mediate nucleo-sarcolemmal and nucleo-myofibrillar exchange.",

Origin of the substance: Naturally-occuring anabolic steroids are synthesized in the testis, ovary and adrenal gland from cholesterol via pregnenolone. Synthetic anabolic steroids are based on the principal male hormone testosterone, modified in one of three ways: alkylation of the 17-carbon; esterification of the 17-OH group and modification of the steroid nucleus. Indications: The only legitimate therapeutic indications for anabolic steroids are: replacement of male sex steroids in men who have androgen deficiency, for example as a result of loss of both testes; the treatment of certain rare forms of aplastic anemia which are or may be responsive to anabolic androgens; the drugs have been used in certain countries to counteract catabolic states, for example after major trauma. HUMAN EXPOSURE: Main risks and target organs: There is no serious risk from acute poisoning, but chronic use can cause harm. The main risks are those of excessive androgens: menstrual irregularities and virilization in women and impotence, premature cardiovascular disease and prostatic hypertrophy in men. Both men and women can suffer liver damage with oral anabolic steroids containing a substituted 17-alpha-carbon. Psychiatric changes can occur during use or after cessation of these agents. Summary of clinical effects: Acute overdosage can produce nausea and gastrointestinal upset. Chronic usage is thought to cause an increase in muscle bulk, and can cause an exageration of male characteristics and effects related to male hormones.  Anabolic steroids can influence sexual function. They can also cause cardiovascular and hepatic damage. Acne and male- pattern baldness occur in both sexes; irregular menses, atrophy of the breasts, and clitoromegaly in women; and testicular atrophy and prostatic hypertrophy in men. Contraindications: Known or suspected cancer of the prostate or (in men) breast.  Pregnancy or breast-feeding and known cardiovascular disease is a relative contraindication. Oral: Anabolic steroids can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but many compounds undergo such extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver that they are inactive. Those compounds in which substitution of the 17-carbon protects the compound from the rapid hepatic metabolism are active orally.  Parenteral: Intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection is the principal route of administration of all the anabolic steroids except the 17-alpha-substituted steroids which are active orally. Absorption by route of exposure: The absorption after oral dosing is rapid for testosterone and probably for other anabolic steroids, but there is extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism for all anabolic steroids except those that are substituted at the 17-alpha position. The rate of absorption from subcutaneous or intramuscular depots depends on the product and its formulation. Absorption is slow for the lipid-soluble esters such as the cypionate or enanthate, and for oily suspensions. Distribution by route of exposure: The anabolic steroids are highly protein bound, and is carried in plasma by a specific protein called sex-hormone binding globulin. Biological half-life by route of exposure: The metabolism of absorbed drug is rapid, and the elimination half-life from plasma is very short. The duration of the biological effects is therefore determined almost entirely by the rate of absorption from subcutaneous or intramuscular depots, and on the de-esterification which precedes it. Metabolism: Free (de-esterified) anabolic androgens are metabolized by hepatic mixed function oxidases. Elimination by route of exposure: After administration of radiolabelled testosterone, about 90% of the radioactivity appears in the urine, and 6% in the feces; there is some enterohepatic recirculation. Mode of action: Toxicodynamics: The toxic effects are an exaggeration of the normal pharmacological effects. Pharmacodynamics: Anabolic steroids bind to specific receptors present especially in reproductive tissue, muscle and fat. The anabolic steroids reduce nitrogen excretion from tissue breakdown in androgen deficient men. They are also responsible for normal male sexual differentiation. The ratio of anabolic (body-building) effects to androgenic (virilizing) effects may differ among the members of the class, but in practice all agents possess both properties to some degree. There is no clear evidence that anabolic steroids enhance overall athletic performance. Carcinogenicity: Anabolic steroids may be carcinogenic. They can stimulate growth of sex-hormone dependent tissue, primarily the prostate gland in men. Precocious prostatic cancer has been described after long-term anabolic steroid abuse. Cases where hepatic cancers have been associated with anabolic steroid abuse have been reported. Teratogenicity: Androgen ingestion by a pregnant mother can cause virilization of a female fetus. Chronic poisoning: Ingestion: Hepatic damage, manifest as derangement of biochemical tests of liver function and sometimes severe enough to cause jaundice; virilization in women; prostatic hypertrophy, impotence and azoospermia in men; acne, abnormal lipids, premature cardiovascular disease (including stroke and myocardial infarction), abnormal glucose tolerance, and muscular hypertrophy in both sexes; psychiatric disturbances can occur during or after prolonged treatment. Parenteral exposure: Virilization in women; prostatic hypertrophy, impotence and azoospermia in men; acne, abnormal lipids, premature cardiovascular disease (including stroke and myocardial infarction), abnormal glucose tolerance, and muscular hypertrophy in both sexes.  Psychiatric disturbances can occur during or after prolonged treatment. Hepatic damage is not expected from parenteral preparations. Course, prognosis, cause of death: Patients with symptoms of acute poisoning are expected to recover rapidly. Patients who persistently abuse high doses of anabolic steroids are at risk of death from premature heart disease or cancer, especially prostatic cancer. Non-fatal but long lasting effects include voice changes in women and fusion of the epiphyses in children.  Other effects are reversible over weeks or months. Systematic description of clinical effects: Cardiovascular: Chronic ingestion of high doses of anabolic steroids can cause elevations in blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy and premature coronary artery disease. Neurological: Central nervous system: Stroke has been described in a young anabolic steroid abuser.  Mania and psychotic symptoms of hallucination and delusion was described in anabolic steroid abusers. They also described depression after withdrawal from anabolic steroids.  There is also considerable debate about the effects of anabolic steroids on aggressive behavior and on criminal behavior. Mood swings were significantly more common in normal volunteers during the active phase of a trial comparing methyltestosterone with placebo. Gastrointestinal: Acute ingestion of large doses can cause nausea and gastrointestinal upset. Hepatic: Orally active (17-alpha substituted) anabolic steroids can cause abnormalities of hepatic function, manifest as abnormally elevated hepatic enzyme activity in biochemical tests of liver function, and sometimes as overt jaundice.  The histological abnormality of peliosis hepatitis has been associated with anabolic steroid use. Angiosarcoma and a case of hepatocellular carcinoma in an anabolic steroid user has been reported. Urinary: Men who take large doses of anabolic steroids can develop prostatic hypertrophy.  Prostatic carcinoma has been described in young men who have abused anabolic steroids. Endocrine and reproductive systems: Small doses of anabolic steroids are said to increase libido, but larger doses lead to azoospermia and impotence. Testicular atrophy is a common clinical feature of long-term abuse of anabolic steroids, and gynacomastia can occur.  Women develop signs of virilism, with increased facial hair, male pattern baldness, acne, deepening of the voice, irregular menses and clitoral enlargement. Dermatological: Acne occurs in both male and female anabolic steroids abusers.  Women can develop signs of virilism, with increased facial hair and male pattern baldness. Eye, ear, nose, throat: local effects: Changes in the larynx in women caused by anabolic steroids can result in a hoarse, deep voice.  The changes are irreversible. Metabolic: Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Sodium and water retention can occur, and result in edema; hypercalcemia is also reported.  Insulin resistance with a fall in glucose tolerance, and hypercholesterolemia with a fall in high density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been reported.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

For 80 days, until 3 weeks before hospitalization, he had been taking moderately high doses of anabolic steroids: metandienone (methandienone), 10-50 mg daily by mouth, and stanozolol, 50 mg intramuscularly every other day. Physical examination was unremarkable except for yellow discoloration of the skin and sclerae. Bilirubin concentration was raised to 4.5 mg/dl, cholestasis enzymes were normal, while transaminase activities were raised. Liver biopsy was compatible with cholestasis induced by anabolic steroids. Although the steroids had been discontinued, the patient's general condition deteriorated over 7 weeks. Serum bilirubin rose up to a maximum of 77.9 mg/dl. In addition renal failure developed with a creatinine concentration of 4.2 mg/dl. The patient's state improved simultaneously with the administration of ursodeoxycholic acid and the biochemical values gradually reached normal levels after several weeks. Anabolic steroids can cause severe cholestasis and acute renal failure. In this case there was a notable temporal coincidence between the administration of ursodeoxycholic acid and the marked clinical improvement.",

In one girl, all symptoms with the exception of the deep voice had disappeared six years after the discontinuation of treatment. In the other girl, final evaluation is not yet possible. The two observations show that androgens and anabolic steroids may have a marked systemic action if applied percutaneously. Treatment with these compounds is indicated very rarely in children and should be restricted to pediatric endocrinologists.",

Female rats received daily injections of AASs for 30 days (Postnatal Day [PN] 21-51). Rats receiving the highest dose of each of the AASs (5 mg/kg) displayed vaginal opening at a younger age than rats receiving the oil vehicle. The day of first vaginal estrus was delayed in rats receiving stanozolol (5 mg/kg) or 17alpha-methyltestosterone (0.5-5 mg/kg) but not in rats receiving methandrostenolone. At the highest dose (5 mg/kg), each of the AASs reduced the incidence of regular estrous cyclicity during the treatment period. Concurrent administration (on PN21-51) of the androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide (10 mg/kg, twice daily), reversed the effects of 17alpha-methyltestosterone (5 mg/kg) on vaginal opening. Flutamide administration also eliminated the effects of stanozolol (5 mg/kg) and 17alpha-methyltestosterone (5 mg/kg) on the day of first vaginal estrus. In contrast, rats receiving flutamide and methandrostenolone (5 mg/kg) exhibited first vaginal estrus earlier than controls. The present results indicate that chronic exposure to AASs during development has deleterious effects on the female neuroendocrine axis and that these effects appear be mediated via multiple mechanisms.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.2X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methandrostenolone will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase methandrostenolone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Methandrostenolone does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methandrostenolone is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2,100. Volatilization from water or moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Methandrostenolone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, methandrostenolone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. An estimated BCF of 100 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to methandrostenolone may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methandrostenolone is produced or used. Exposure to the drug among the general population may be limited to those taking methandrostenolone (an anabolic steroid). Intentional human exposure may have occurred from possible methandrostenolone use as a performance enhancement drug in athletes. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

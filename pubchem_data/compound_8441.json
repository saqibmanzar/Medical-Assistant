PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Phosphate levels were low, in contrast to bladder calculi from animals treated directly with terephthalic acid. ... An acidic urinary pH was believed to have induced the hypercalciuria, a characteristic of urolithiasis in man. The higher urinary concentrations of TPA from DMT in the diet (when compared to similar dietary concentrations of TPA) explained the higher incidence of urinary calculi from the DMT diets than from comparable levels of TPA in the diet. Urinary phosphate levels were decreased in the animals consuming the DMT diet and explained why phosphate was present only at very low levels in the bladder calculi in those animals. ... Weanling rats are probably more sensitive to the induction of bladder calculi than adults due to their very high feed consumption rates relative to body weight.",

Matched controls consisted of 50 untreated rats of each sex and 50 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving rats were killed at 105 or 106 weeks and all surviving mice at 104 or 105 weeks. ... Although it is recognized that both rats and mice may not have received a dose of the test chemical sufficiently high to provide maximum test sensitivity, it is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, dimethyl terephthalate was not carcinogenic for F344 rats or B6C3F1 mice.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.01 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dimethyl terephthalate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dimethyl terephthalate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 28 days. Dimethyl terephthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dimethyl terephthalate is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 400. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Dimethyl terephthalate, at a concentration of 0.5%, degraded completely in 15 days in soil with a pH of 8.2 and 60% moisture content, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, dimethyl terephthalate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A 3 day river die-away test using 50, 40, and 5 ppm dimethyl terephthalate resulted in 100% biodegradation in all three tests of river water, and 27, 38, and 49% biodegradation in the three tests of sea water suggesting dimethyl terephthalate is expected to biodegrade in aquatic environments. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hours and 8.3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 260 and 26 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to dimethyl terephthalate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimethyl terephthalate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dimethyl terephthalate via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.01 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 19 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hours and 8.3 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 11(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A 3 day river die-away test using 50, 40, and 5 ppm dimethyl terephthalate resulted in 100% biodegradation in all three tests of river water, and 27, 38, and 49% biodegradation in the three tests of sea water(8) suggesting dimethyl terephthalate is expected to biodegrade in aquatic environments(SRC).",

Vapor-phase dimethyl terephthalate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 28 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.7X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Dimethyl terephthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

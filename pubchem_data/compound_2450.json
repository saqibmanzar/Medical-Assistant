First synthesized in 1897, bronopol was primarily used as a preservative for pharmaceuticals and was registered in the United States in 1984 for use in industrial bactericides, slimicides and preservatives. Bronopol is used as a microbicide or microbiostat in various commercial and industrial applications, including oil field systems, air washer systems, air conditioning or humidifying systems, cooling water systems, papermills, absorbent clays, metal working fluids, printing inks, paints, adhesives and consumer products. Compared to other aliphatic halogen-nitro compounds, bronopol is more stable to hydrolysis in aqueous media under normal conditions. The inhibitory activity against various bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was demonstrated in vitro. The agent is largely available commercially as an antibacterial for a variety of industrial purposes while it is predominantly available for purchase as a pet animal litter antibacterial at the domestic consumer level. Nevertheless, ongoing contemporary re-evaluations of bronopol use in large markets such as Canada now place various compositional and product restrictions on the use of the agent in cosmetic products and in other products where it may not primarily be used in the role of a non-medicinal preservative antimicrobial.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Bronopol was also demonstrated to be effective against various fungal species, but the inhibitory action is reported to be minimal compared to that of against bacterial species. The inhibitory activity of bronopol decreases with increasing pH of the media. Bronopol also elicits an anti-protozoal activity, as demonstrated with _Ichthyophthirius multifiliis_ _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. It is proposed that bronopol affects the survival of all free-living stages of _I. multifiliis_.",

Animals were treated by gavage with (14)C bronopol (radiochemical purity: >95-100%). In the first study animals received a single dose of 10 mg/kg. The second study employed a higher dose of 50 mg/kg. Doses higher the 50 mg/kg caused respiratory problems and death. The third study's dose was 10 mg/kg (14 daily doses of nonradioactive, 100% pure, bronopol, followed by one dose of (14)C-bronopol). Urine, feces and CO2 were collected for 7 days after dosing, at which time the rats were killed and the tissues examined for radioactivity. Because, irrespective of the dose, most of the administered (14)C was excreted in urine (64-78% in 24 hours and 68-83% in 7 days), urine was used for the identification of metabolites in the fourth study. Feces, CO2 and tissues represented minor routes of excretion of (14)C. Very little (14)C was also detected in the whole blood and plasma. From the results of these four studies... /it was/ concluded that bronopol administered orally was rapidly absorbed and rapidly excreted by the rats of both sexes, with urine being the major route of excretion.",

The 24 hr recoveries of (14)C in the urine and expired air were 15 and 2%, respectively, of the dose applied to the skin, and 74 and 9%, respectively, of the dose given intravenously.

Toxicity evolution of a labile preservative, bronopol, upon primary aquatic degradation processes was investigated. Bronopol rapidly hydrolyzed in natural waters, and primarily produced more stable 2-bromo-2-nitroethanol (BNE) and bromonitromethane (BNM). Light enhanced degradation of the targeted compounds with water site specific photoactivity. The bond order analysis theoretically revealed that the reversible retroaldol reactions were primary degradation routes for bronopol and BNE. Judging from toxicity assays and the relative pesticide toxicity index, these degradation products (i.e., BNE and BNM), more persistent and higher toxic than the parent, probably accumulated in natural waters and resulted in higher or prolonging adverse impacts. Therefore, these transformation products should be included into the assessment of ecological risks of non-persistent and low toxic chemicals such as the preservative bronopol.",

Once in the body, nitrosamines are metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes, which essentially activates them into carcinogens. Sarcosine is metabolized to glycine by the enzyme sarcosine dehydrogenase. Formaldehyde may be absorbed following inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure. It is an essential metabolic intermediate in all cells and is produced during the normal metabolism of serine, glycine, methionine, and choline and also by the demethylation of N-, S-, and O-methyl compounds. Exogenous formaldehyde is metabolized to formate by the enzyme formaldehyde dehydrogenase at the initial site of contact. After oxidation of formaldehyde to formate, the carbon atom is further oxidized to carbon dioxide or incorporated into purines, thymidine, and amino acids via tetrahydrofolatedependent one-carbon biosynthetic pathways. Formaldehyde is not stored in the body and is excreted in the urine (primarily as formic acid), incorporated into other cellular molecules, or exhaled as carbon dioxide. (A2878, A2879, L1892, L962)",

Under aerobic conditions, bronopol catalyzes the oxidation of thiol groups, such as cysteine, to disulfides. This reaction is accompanied by rapid consumption of oxygen, where oxygen acts as the final oxidant. During the conversion of cysteine to cystine, radical anion intermediates such as superoxide and peroxide are formed from bronopol to exert a direct bactericidal activity. The oxidation of excess thiols alters the redox state to create anoxic conditions, leading to a second reaction involving the oxidation of intracellular thiols such as glutathione to its disulfide. The resulting effects are inhibition of enzyme function, and reduced growth rate following the bacteriostatic period. Under the anoxic conditions, the reaction between thiol and bronopol decelerates without the involvement of oxygen and the consumption of bronopol predominates. Bronopol is ultimately removed from the reaction via consumption and resumption of bacterial growth occurs.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

These decomposition products can react with any secondary amines or amides (which may contaminate cosmetic products) to produce significant levels of nitrosamines, which are believed to be carcinogenic. Once in the body, nitrosamines are activated by cytochrome P-450 enzymes. They are then believed to induce their carcinogenic effects by forming DNA adducts at the N- and O-atoms. Formaldehyde itself is also carcinogenic. It is likely that formaldehyde toxicity occurs when intracellular levels saturate formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity, allowing the unmetabolized intact molecule to exert its effects. Formaldehyde is known to form cross links between protein and DNA and undergo metabolic incorporation into macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins).

A 35 year old male veterinary surgeon developed a painful erythematous swelling on his left arm extending from the fingers to the mid upper arm. He stated that he had abraded his arm at work 2 weeks previously. Because he was employed as an equine gynecologist the cause of the inflammation was thought to be cellulitis. He was treated with oral penicillin and flucloxacillin and his arm was elevated in a sling. With his left arm immobilized he had to use his right arm at work. He returned 4 days later with the erythematous swelling now present on the right arm. The swelling on both arms was treated as contact dermatitis with corticosteroids and emollients. Further inquiry about his occupation revealed that he practiced as a specialist stud farm veterinarian and he spent much of his time performing ultrasonic examinations through the rectum of thoroughbred mares to assess the state of the ovaries and pregnancy. This required a full arm rectal examination. Shortly before his left arm became swollen, he had started using a new lubricant jelly, Vet-Lubrigel. He was advised to use an alternative lubricant. His arms improved rapidly after he switched to the new lubricant. Subsequent patch testing showed that he was allergic to both Vet-Lubrigel and its preservative Bronopol.",

Formaldehyde is very often suspected to be the sensitizing agent of formaldehyde-releasers; however, many reported clinical cases of contact allergy to these molecules such as bronopol (2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol) indicate negative skin reactions to formaldehyde suggesting a more complex mechanism. The aim of this study was to compare the chemical reactivity and biological activity of formaldehyde with those of two formaldehyde releasers: 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol and 1,3-dimethylol-5,5-dimethylhydantoin. A key step in the sensitization to chemicals is the formation of the hapten-protein antigenic complex via covalent binding between the chemical sensitizer and amino acids in proteins. The chemical reactivity of the three compounds was thus addressed using (13)C NMR analysis of adduct formation upon incubation with a set of nucleophilic amino acids. The biological activity was measured in two in vitro models based on dendritic cells and a monocytic cell line (CD34-DC and THP-1 model) through monitoring of a panel of biomarkers. The results obtained show that 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol produces low amount of free formaldehyde in physiological buffers but that its degradation generates various molecules including 2-bromoethanol. In addition, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol also generates adducts with amino acids, not observed with formaldehyde alone, that could be explained by the reactivity of 2-bromoethanol. In parallel, in a cellular approach using the human monocytic THP-1 cell line, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol activates THP-1 cells at concentrations that are not correlated to simple formaldehyde release. This observation is confirmed in the more physiological model CD34-DC. Moreover, in the THP-1 model, the expression profiles of several biomarkers are specific to 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol. Finally, the use in the cellular model of the pure degradation products identified by NMR reveals the reactivity of bromonitromethane. In contrast, 1,3-dimethylol-5,5-dimethylhydantoin presents chemical and biological reactivities similar to those of formaldehyde. Taken together, these data suggest that 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol is an atypical formaldehyde releaser, releasing low amounts of formaldehyde at physiological conditions but producing multiple degradation products among which 2-bromoethanol and bromonitromethane are potential candidates for explaining the specific allergic reactions to 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.26X10-5 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates bronopol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase bronopol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 days. Particulate-phase bronopol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Bronopol rapidly photodegrades at pH 4 exhibiting a photolysis half-life of 24 hours in water; under natural sunlight, a photolysis half-life of 2 days is expected. Therefore, bronopol may be susceptible to direct photolysis. If released to soil, bronopol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Bronopol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, bronopol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. At 20 \u00b0C, the hydrolysis half-life was extrapolated to be about 18 years at pH 4, about 1.5 years at pH 6, and approximately 2 months at pH 8. Occupational exposure to bronopol may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bronopol is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to bronopol via dermal contact with this compound or other consumer products containing bronopol. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 1.26X10-5 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 2.5X10+5 mg/L(5). Bronopol is stable to hydrolysis under normal environmental conditions. At 20 \u00b0C, the hydrolysis half-life was extrapolated to be about 18 years at pH 4, about 1.5 years at pH 6, and approximately 2 months at pH 8(6). Bronopol rapidly photodegrades at pH 4 exhibiting a photolysis half-life of 24 hours in water(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 1(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -0.64(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Bronopol was not biodegraded using a mixed culture sewage sludge test(8); therefore, biodegradation is not expected to be an important fate process in the aquatic environment(SRC).",

Vapor-phase bronopol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.3X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase bronopol may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Bronopol rapidly photodegrades at pH 4 exhibiting a photolysis half-life of 24 hours in water; under natural sunlight, a photolysis half-life of 2 days is expected(3). Therefore, bronopol may be susceptible to direct photolysis(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Also displays affinity for rodent 5-HT5B, 5-HT5A, 5-HT7 and 5-HT6 receptors (pK1 values are 6.6, 7.0, 8.4 and 8.7 respectively). It has a role as an antipsychotic agent, a dopaminergic antagonist, a serotonergic antagonist and a geroprotector. It is a N-alkylpiperazine, a dibenzothiepine, an aryl sulfide and a tertiary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a methiothepin(2+).",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

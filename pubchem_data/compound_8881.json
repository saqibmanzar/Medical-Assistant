For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Dose dependent shifts in disposition and metabolism and the effects of repeated oral exposure were also considered. 1,2-dichloropropane was given in corn oil to male and female Fischer 344 rats in single oral target doses of 1 or 100 mg/kg, or were given multiple 1 mg/kg nonradiolabeled doses for 7 days followed by a single radiolabeled 1 mg/kg dose on day eight. Target concn of 5, 50, or 100 ppm labeled 1,2-dichloropropane were given for 6 hr periods in head only inhalation chambers under dynamic flow through conditions. Urine, feces, expired air, and blood samples were collected and analyzed by wt, liquid scintillation counting, HPLC, and GC/MS. Overall radioactivity disposition following oral and inhalation exposure was comparable between the sexes. Most of the radioactivity was recovered through the urine and expired air for both types of exposure. Eliminated amounts in the urine following oral administration were comparable between the treatment groups. Increasing inhaled concn of 1,2-dichloropropane were paralleled by increasing amounts of exhaled volatile organics. This indicated a dose dependency in the metabolism and elimination of 1,2-dichloropropane following inhalation exposure. The major urinary metabolites from both forms of exposure were three N-acetylcysteine conjugates of 1,2-dichloropropane. At the end of inhalation exposure, 1,2-dichloropropane was quickly eliminated from the blood although peak blood 1,2-dichloropropane levels were not proportional to concn. In all groups and for both exposures, most of the radioactivity was eliminated 24 hr after dosing with no noted difference between the sexes. It was concluded that pharmacokinetics and metabolism of 1,2-dichloropropane are similar with respect to exposure route and sex in rats.",

Some fumigants are corrosive to the cornea and may cause BLINDNESS. Specialized medical treatment should be obtained promptly following removal of toxicant by copious flushing with clean water. Skin contamination may cause BLISTERING and deep chemical burns. Absorption of some fumigants across the skin may be sufficient to cause systemic poisoning in the absence of fumigant inhalation. For all these reasons, decontamination of eyes and skin must must be IMMEDIATE and THROUGH. 2. REMOVE victims of fumigant inhalation to FRESH AIR immediately. Even though initial symptoms and signs are mild, keep the victim quiet, in a semi-reclining position. Minimum pohysical activity limits the likehood ofpulmonary edema. 3. If victim is not breathing, clear the airway of secretions and RESUSCITATE with positive poressure oxygen apparatus. If this is not available, use chest compression to sustain respiration. If victim is pulseless, employ cardiac resuscitation. 4. If PULMONARY EDEMA is evident, there are several measures avilable to sustain life. Medical judgement must be relied upon, however, in the management of each case. The following procedures are generally recommended: A. Put the victim in a SITTING position with a backrest. B. Use intermittent and/or continuous positive pressure OXYGEN to relieve hypoxemia. ... C. Slowly administer FUROSEMIDE, 40 mg, or SODIUM ETHACRYNATE, 50 mg, to reduce venous load by inducing diuresis. ... D. Morphine in small doses (5-10 mg), slowly, iv to allay anxiety and promote deeper respiratory excursions. E. Administer AMINOPHYLLINE (0.25-0.50 gm) slowly, iv. ... F. Digitalization may be considered, but there is a serious risk of arrhythmias in an anoxic and toxic myocardium. G. TRACHEOSTOMY may be necessary in some cases to facilitate aspiration of large amounts of pulmonary edema fluid. H. Epinephrine, atorpine, and expectorants are generally not helpful, and may complicate treatment. I. Watch for RECURRENT PULMONARY EDEMA, even up to 2 weeks after the initial episode. Limit victim's physical activity for at least 4 weeks. Severe physical weakness usually indicates persistent pulmonary injury. Serial pulmonary function testing may be useful in assessing recovery. 5. Combat SHOCK by placing victim in the Trendelenburg position and administering plasma, whole blood, and/or electrolyte and glucose solutions intravenously, with great care, to avoid pulmonary edema. Central venous pressure should be monitored continously. Vasopressor amines must be given with great caution, because of the irritability of the myocardium. 6. Control CONVULSIONS. Seizures are most likely to occur in poisonings by methyl bromide, hydrogen cyanide, acrylonitrile, phosphine, and carbon disulfide. ... /Fumigant poisoning/",

If a FUMIGANT LIQUID OR SOLID has been INGESTED less than several hours prior to treatment, quantities remaining in the stomach must be removed as effectively as possible by gastric intubation, aspiration, and lavage, after all possible precautions have been taken to protect the respiratory tract from aspirated gasric contents. A. Put in place a cuffed ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE prior to gastric intubation. Administer OXYGEN, using a mechanical ventilator if respiration is depressed. B. Lavage the stomach with a slurry of ACTIVATED CHARCOAL in saline or water. Leave a volume of the slurry in the stomach with an appropriate dose of sorbitol as cathartic ... . C. If treatment is delayed and if the patient remains fully alert, adminsiter activated charcoal and sorbitol orally. ... Repeated administration of charcoal at half or more the initial dosage every 2-4 hours may be beneficial. D. Do not given vegetable or animal fats or oils, which enhance gastrointestinal absorption of many of the fumigant compounds. 8. Intravenous infusions of GLUCOSE are valuable in limiting the heptotoxicity of many substances. Monitor central venous presure to avoid precipitating, or aggravating, pulmonary edema by fluid overlaod. The victim should be watched closely for indications of delayed or recurrent pulmonary edema, and for bronchophenumonia. Fluid balance should be monitored, and urine sediment should be checked regularly for indications of tubular injury. Measure serum alkaline phosphatase, LDH, ALT, AST, and bilirubin to assess liver injury. 9. HEMOPERFUSION OVER ACTIVATED CHARCOAL has been used in managing a case of carbon tetrachloride poisoning with apparent success. ... 10. EXTRACORPOREAL HEMODIALYSIS may be needed to regulate extracellular fluid composition if renal failure supervenes. It is probably not very effective in removing lipophilic fumigant compounds from blood, but is, of course, effective in controlling extracellular fluid composition if renal failure occurs. /Fumigant poisoning/",

Administer oxygen if there is evidence of altered mental status or dyspnea. Treat hypotension with volume expansion & vasopression. Use lidocaine or beta-blockers for ventricular arrhythmias. Skin: Remove contaminated clothing. Wash affected area with soap & copious amounts or water. Eye: Irrigate the eye for 15-20 min. Obtain a consultation if symptoms persist. Oral: Most of the halogenated solvents ingested in quantities of 1-2 swallows may be partially removed by ipecac-induced emesis if admin within a few hr to a patient who has not lost the gag reflex, is not seizing, is not markedly lethargic, or is not in coma. Observe the patient in the upright position to lessen the possibility of aspiration. Activated charcoal is probably ineffective. Inhalation: Move from the contaminated area. Provide a source of oxygen & prepare for mechanical ventilation. If the patient is unconscious & the pulse is absent, initiate CPR measures. Enhancement of Elimination: Maintain good ventilation. Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion are not likely to be useful because of the high lipophilic properties of these solvents. Antidote: N-acetylcysteine may restore depleted glutathione stores, but no adequate clinical studies are available to validate this possible treatment. Supportive Care: Watch for cardiac dysrhythmias, aspiration pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, & hypoxic encephalopathy. Monitor for arrhythmia for at least 24 hr & for hepatorenal failure for about 3 days. Obtain a chest x-ray, arterial blood gas, EKG, serum creatinine, & hepatic aminotransferase. Check electrolyte imbalance daily. Treat renal failure with dialysis & hepatic failure with fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K, a low-protein diet, neomycin, & lactulose. Watch fluid & electrolyte balance. /Halogenated hydrocarbons/",

Some fumigants are corrosive to the cornea and may cause BLINDNESS. Specialized medical treatment should be obtained promptly following removal of toxicant by copious flushing with clean water. Skin contamination may cause BLISTERING and deep chemical burns. Absorption of some fumigants across the skin may be sufficient to cause systemic poisoning in the absence of fumigant inhalation. For all these reasons, decontamination of eyes and skin must must be IMMEDIATE and THROUGH. 2. REMOVE victims of fumigant inhalation to FRESH AIR immediately. Even though initial symptoms and signs are mild, keep the victim quiet, in a semi-reclining position. Minimum pohysical activity limits the likehood ofpulmonary edema. 3. If victim is not breathing, clear the airway of secretions and RESUSCITATE with positive poressure oxygen apparatus. If this is not available, use chest compression to sustain respiration. If victim is pulseless, employ cardiac resuscitation. 4. If PULMONARY EDEMA is evident, there are several measures avilable to sustain life. Medical judgement must be relied upon, however, in the management of each case. The following procedures are generally recommended: A. Put the victim in a SITTING position with a backrest. B. Use intermittent and/or continuous positive pressure OXYGEN to relieve hypoxemia. ... C. Slowly administer FUROSEMIDE, 40 mg, or SODIUM ETHACRYNATE, 50 mg, to reduce venous load by inducing diuresis. ... D. Morphine in small doses (5-10 mg), slowly, iv to allay anxiety and promote deeper respiratory excursions. E. Administer AMINOPHYLLINE (0.25-0.50 gm) slowly, iv. ... F. Digitalization may be considered, but there is a serious risk of arrhythmias in an anoxic and toxic myocardium. G. TRACHEOSTOMY may be necessary in some cases to facilitate aspiration of large amounts of pulmonary edema fluid. H. Epinephrine, atorpine, and expectorants are generally not helpful, and may complicate treatment. I. Watch for RECURRENT PULMONARY EDEMA, even up to 2 weeks after the initial episode. Limit victim's physical activity for at least 4 weeks. Severe physical weakness usually indicates persistent pulmonary injury. Serial pulmonary function testing may be useful in assessing recovery. 5. Combat SHOCK by placing victim in the Trendelenburg position and administering plasma, whole blood, and/or electrolyte and glucose solutions intravenously, with great care, to avoid pulmonary edema. Central venous pressure should be monitored continously. Vasopressor amines must be given with great caution, because of the irritability of the myocardium. 6. Control CONVULSIONS. Seizures are most likely to occur in poisonings by methyl bromide, hydrogen cyanide, acrylonitrile, phosphine, and carbon disulfide. ... /Fumigant poisoning/",

If a FUMIGANT LIQUID OR SOLID has been INGESTED less than several hours prior to treatment, quantities remaining in the stomach must be removed as effectively as possible by gastric intubation, aspiration, and lavage, after all possible precautions have been taken to protect the respiratory tract from aspirated gasric contents. A. Put in place a cuffed ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE prior to gastric intubation. Administer OXYGEN, using a mechanical ventilator if respiration is depressed. B. Lavage the stomach with a slurry of ACTIVATED CHARCOAL in saline or water. Leave a volume of the slurry in the stomach with an appropriate dose of sorbitol as cathartic ... . C. If treatment is delayed and if the patient remains fully alert, adminsiter activated charcoal and sorbitol orally. ... Repeated administration of charcoal at half or more the initial dosage every 2-4 hours may be beneficial. D. Do not given vegetable or animal fats or oils, which enhance gastrointestinal absorption of many of the fumigant compounds. 8. Intravenous infusions of GLUCOSE are valuable in limiting the heptotoxicity of many substances. Monitor central venous presure to avoid precipitating, or aggravating, pulmonary edema by fluid overlaod. The victim should be watched closely for indications of delayed or recurrent pulmonary edema, and for bronchophenumonia. Fluid balance should be monitored, and urine sediment should be checked regularly for indications of tubular injury. Measure serum alkaline phosphatase, LDH, ALT, AST, and bilirubin to assess liver injury. 9. HEMOPERFUSION OVER ACTIVATED CHARCOAL has been used in managing a case of carbon tetrachloride poisoning with apparent success. ... 10. EXTRACORPOREAL HEMODIALYSIS may be needed to regulate extracellular fluid composition if renal failure supervenes. It is probably not very effective in removing lipophilic fumigant compounds from blood, but is, of course, effective in controlling extracellular fluid composition if renal failure occurs. /Fumigant poisoning/",

Administer oxygen if there is evidence of altered mental status or dyspnea. Treat hypotension with volume expansion & vasopression. Use lidocaine or beta-blockers for ventricular arrhythmias. Skin: Remove contaminated clothing. Wash affected area with soap & copious amounts or water. Eye: Irrigate the eye for 15-20 min. Obtain a consultation if symptoms persist. Oral: Most of the halogenated solvents ingested in quantities of 1-2 swallows may be partially removed by ipecac-induced emesis if admin within a few hr to a patient who has not lost the gag reflex, is not seizing, is not markedly lethargic, or is not in coma. Observe the patient in the upright position to lessen the possibility of aspiration. Activated charcoal is probably ineffective. Inhalation: Move from the contaminated area. Provide a source of oxygen & prepare for mechanical ventilation. If the patient is unconscious & the pulse is absent, initiate CPR measures. Enhancement of Elimination: Maintain good ventilation. Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion are not likely to be useful because of the high lipophilic properties of these solvents. Antidote: N-acetylcysteine may restore depleted glutathione stores, but no adequate clinical studies are available to validate this possible treatment. Supportive Care: Watch for cardiac dysrhythmias, aspiration pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, & hypoxic encephalopathy. Monitor for arrhythmia for at least 24 hr & for hepatorenal failure for about 3 days. Obtain a chest x-ray, arterial blood gas, EKG, serum creatinine, & hepatic aminotransferase. Check electrolyte imbalance daily. Treat renal failure with dialysis & hepatic failure with fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K, a low-protein diet, neomycin, & lactulose. Watch fluid & electrolyte balance. /Halogenated hydrocarbons/",

The chemical was applied by gavage for the acute and short term studies at doses of 0, 100, 250, 500, or 1000 mg dichloropropane/kg in corn oil once daily for up to 10 consecutive days. Although ingestion of dichloropropane caused body weight loss and central nervous system depression, few other toxic effects were manifest 24 hours after a single dose of the chemical. Morphologic changes were limited to liver centrilobular cells in 500 and 1000 mg/kg rats. Hepatic nonprotein sulfhydryl levels were decreased and renal nonprotein sulfhydryl levels were increased at 24 hr. In the short term study resistance developed to dichloropropane hepatotoxicity over the 10 consecutive days of exposure, as reflected by progressively lower serum enzyme levels and by decreases in the severity and incidence of toxic hepatitis and periportal vacuolization. Nucleolar enlargement in hepatocytes was observed at all dosage levels at 5 and 10 days. Manifestations of hemolytic anemia were observed; these included erythrophagocytosis in the liver, splenic hemosiderosis and hyperplasia of erythropoietic elements of the red pulp, renal tubular cell hemosiderosis, and hyperbilirubinemia. Nephrotoxicity was absent. In the long term study, rats initially weighing 180 to 200 g were gavaged 5 times weekly for up to 13 weeks with 0, 100, 250, 500, or 750 mg dichloropropane/kg. Over half of the 750 mg/kg group died within 10 days. Histopathologic changes in the survivors of the 750 mg/kg group included mild hepatitis and splenic hemosiderosis, adrenal medullary vacuolization and cortical lipidosis, testicular degeneration and reduction in sperm, and increased number of degenerate spermatogonia in the epididymis. Similar testicular and epididymal degenerative changes were observed in some 500 mg/kg animals after 13 weeks of dosing. In the 500 mg/kg group, >50% were dead by 13 weeks. No deaths occurred in the 100 or 250 mg/kg groups. Slight elevations in serum ornithine-carbamyl transferase activity, periportal vacuolization, and active hepatic fibroplasia were seen in the 500 mg/kg group. Dose dependent elevations in serum bilirubin were noted and at 10 and 12 weeks, the increases were statistically significant in the 100 mg/kg group. Hemosiderosis and hyperplasia of the erythropoietic elements of the spleen were present in most dichloropropane dosed animals at all exposure levels. Liver/body weight and spleen/body weight ratios were higher, while hematocrit and hemoglobin levels were significantly lower, than those of controls in the 250 and 500 mg/kg animals. The effects of the long term dosage regimen largely disappeared during a one week recovery period.",

Rats were exposed to a wide range of 1,2-dichloropropane concn by inhalation. Blood 1,2-dichloropropane levels were also measured to ascertain their potential value as indicators of environmental 1,2-dichloropropane exposure. At the end of the 4 hr exposure period, mean values of blood 1,2-dichloropropane levels were 0.025 and 5.380 ug/ml in rats exposed to 15 and 1300 mg/cu m, respectively. At exposure levels ranging from 15 to 800 mg/cu m, blood concn were correlated significantly with environmental concn. Only trace amounts of 1,2-dichloropropane were still present in the blood of rats sacrificed 20 hr after the end of treatment. Serum chemistry parameters, hepatic lipid peroxidation and hepatic protein content were similar in control and 1,2-dichloropropane treated rats. In rats exposed to 15 or 50 mg/cu m 1,2-dichloropropane, hepatic glutathione levels remained unaffected, but they were reduced in the animals exposed to 100 to 4900 mg/cu m. Glutathione depletion was highest after exposures to 450 mg/cu m. Discontinuation of 1,2-dichloropropane exposure resulted in the restoration of glutathione content. The experiments demonstrated a relationship between 1,2-dichloropropane levels in the exposure chamber and corresponding blood concn of the solvent given at subtoxic doses to rats, indicating the possible usefulness of 1,2-dichloropropane levels in the blood in determining environmental exposure.",

Male Wistar rats were injected ip with 1,2-dichloropropane daily for 5 days or 5 days/wk for 4 wk; dose levels used were 0, 50, 100, 250, and 500 mg/kg body wt. Rats were sacrificed 24 hr after the last treatment for assessment of nephrotoxicity. The renal proximal tubule brush border was prepared from one kidney for measurement of angiotensin converting enzyme activity and proteins, while the other kidney was subdivided for histological examination. The kidney to body wt ratio was not significantly different among the groups. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity varied according to treatment; while 250 mg/kg 1,2-dichloropropane for 5 days caused a significant increase in angiotensin converting enzyme activity, 500 mg/kg for 5 days caused a significant decrease. A dose dependent decrease in enzyme activity was observed when the treatment was prolonged to 4 wk. Administration of 1,2-dichloropropane for 5 days produced an enlargement of the microvilli of the brush border; destruction and fraying were noted at higher doses. Four wk treatment caused dose dependent fraying of the microvilli, with epithelial coagulative necrosis of the brush border at higher doses. Glomerular changes were characterized by dose dependent mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, with mesangial and subepithelial granular deposition. The authors conclude that 1,2-dichloropropane causes kidney alterations in experimental animals at sublethal doses.",

Male Wistar rats were given ip doses of 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, or 500 mg/kg 1,2-dichloropropane once daily for 5 days, or 5 days a wk for 4 wk. Fasting rats were killed 24 hr after the last treatment, and livers harvested for determination of glutathione, protein contents, and cytochrome p450 and glutathione-S-transferase activities. In a second experiment, glutathione was determined in rats given single doses of 0, 50, 100, or 250 mg/kg 1,2-dichloropropane. Mercapturic acids excretion was dose dependent, and was significantly increased compared to controls. Except for the two highest dosages, mercapturic acids returned to baseline after treatment and did not progressively increase. Single doses of 1,2-dichloropropane decreased glutathione liver content, ranging from 42% of controls given 50 mg/kg to 67% given 250 mg/kg. Glutathione returned to baseline by 12 hr after injection. Glutathione content and cytochrome p450 activity were not significantly changed after 5 days of treatment; however, after 4 wk glutathione content and glutathione-S-transferase activity were increased dependent on dose with doses higher than 25 mg/kg, and cytochrome p450 content was significantly decreased with doses of 250 or 500 mg/kg. Histological examination revealed hyperplasia dependent on dose and length of treatment. Isolated areas of focal necrosis were observed, and tended to disappear after long term treatment. It was concluded that 1,2-dichloropropane does not accumulate, but does cause biochemical and histological changes in rat liver.",

Male Wistar rats were injected ip with 0, 50, 100, 250, or 500 mg/kg 1,2-dichloropropane daily 5 days a wk for 4 wk. Selected rats were killed immediately or 4 wk after the last dose and the livers and kidneys were removed. Hepatic and renal cytochrome p-450, aniline hydroxylase, glutathione-S-transferase activity and glutathione content were determined. Cytochrome p-450 and aniline hydroxylase were markers of phase-I metabolism and glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione markers of phase-II metabolism. Hepatic aminopyrine demethylase and renal angiotensin converting enzyme activities were also measured. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity. 1,2-Dichloropropane caused dose dependent increases in hepatic aminopyrine demethylase, glutathione, and glutathione-S-transferase. The 500 mg/kg dose significantly decreased cytochrome p-450 activity. Plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase and hepatic aniline hydroxylase activity were not affected. Except for glutathione concn, all parameters of hepatic function returned to the control value 4 wk post exposure. Renal glutathione-S-transferase was significantly increased by 250 and 500 mg/kg 1,2-dichloropropane and glutathione was significantly increased by 500 mg/kg 1,2-dichloropropane. 1,2-Dichloropropane at 100 to 500 mg/kg caused a dose dependent decrease in angiotensin converting enzyme activity. All markers of kidney function returned to the control values after 4 wk of recovery. The authors conclude that 1,2-dichloropropane affects liver function to a greater extent than kidney function and at lower doses. Glutathione concn and glutathione-S-transferase activity appear to be the most sensitive indicator of liver involvement. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity appears to be the most sensitive indicator of 1,2-dichloropropane nephrotoxicity. The effects of 1,2-dichloropropane on liver and kidney function are reversible.",

Triglycerides were measured in serum of treated animals or in supernatants of isolated hepatocytes exposed to solvents and tritiated glycerol. Two hours following carbon tetrachloride injection, triglyceride levels were reduced significantly to 42% o control values and to 15% by 8 hr. Methylene chloride caused a more rapid decline in serum triglyceride concn. Significant dose related decreases in serum triglyceride levels at 2 hr followed the administration of 1-chloropropane, 1-chlorobutane, 1-chloropentane, 1-chlorohexane, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,3-dichloropropane, 1,4-dichlorobutane, and 1,5-dichloropentane. The shorter chain, less lipid soluble solvents were the more potent at decreasing triglyceride secretion in vivo. In freshly prepared isolated hepatocyte systems, the relationship between 50% inhibitory concn and lipid solubility was opposite to that observed in vivo. The more lipid soluble solvents were the more potent at decreasing secretion in vitro. The authors suggest from this finding that nonspecific solvent effects on membrane integrity may be important in the inhibition of triglyceride secretion. The chlorinated alkane induced development of fatty liver through inhibition of triglyceride secretion may be related to lipid solubility of the chemical rather than to its metabolism to free radicals.",

If released to air, vapor pressures in the range of 18.2-68.3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicate that dichloropropanes will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dichloropropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to range from 16-236 days. If released to soil, dichloropropanes are expected to have very high to high mobility based upon estimated Koc values of 49-81. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.76X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Hydrolysis and biodegradation are not expected to be important environmental fate processes for dichloropropanes due to the relative slow rate of biodegradation and hydrolysis in comparison to volatilization. When soil treated with 1,2-dichloropropane was stored outdoors in an open container, 99% disappeared during a 10 day incubation period, with the majority of loss attributed to volatilization. If released into water, dichloropropanes are not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon the Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 4.5 days, respectively. BCF values in the range of 1.2-6.9 measured in fish, suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to dichloropropanes may occur through inhalation and dermal contact at workplaces where 1,2-dichloropropane and 1,3-dichloropropene are produced or used. (SRC)",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 18.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,3-dichloropropane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,3-dichloropropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 days. If released to soil, 1,3-dichloropropane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon a an estimated Koc of 290. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.76X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. 1,3-Dichloropropane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The hydrolysis half-life of 1,3-dichloropropane is 2.3 years, indicating that hydrolysis will occur slowly in moist soil and water. Using a standard dilution method and a sewage seed inoculum, 1,3-dichloropropane achieved 16% of its theoretical BOD during a 5 day incubation period, suggesting biodegradation may occur in soil and water. If released into water, 1,3-dichloropropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 4.5, days respectively. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Since this compound is apparently not produced or used in the United States, general population exposure and occupational exposure is expected to be very low or non-existent. (SRC)",

Volatilization of dichloropropanes from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 9.76X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(3). The potential for volatilization of dichloropropanes from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon vapor pressures in the range of 18.2-68.3 mm Hg(4,5). Hydrolysis and biodegradation are not expected to be important environmental fate processes in soil for dichloropropanes due to the relative slow rate of biodegradation and hydrolysis in comparison to volatilization(6-8). When soil treated with 1,2-dichloropropane was stored outdoors in an open container, 99% disappeared during a 10 day incubation period, with the majority of loss attributed to volatilization(8).",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 4.5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 7(SRC) from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The hydrolysis half-life of 1,3-dichloropropane is 2.3 years at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C(7). Using a standard dilution method and a sewage seed inoculum, 1,3-dichloropropane achieved 16% of the theoretical BOD during a 5 day incubation period(8), suggesting biodegradation may occur in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

All other monitoring data listed below refer to the 1,2-dichloropropane isomer. Lake Ontario (95 stations) 4 stations have concentrations ranging from 210-440 parts per trillion and 15 others have trace quantities(3). Lower Niagara River (16 stations) 4 stations had concentrations ranging from 7-55 parts per trillion and 5 other stations had trace quantities(3). 1,2-Dichloropropane was detected in 19 out of 141 samples from the Ohio River (1977-78)at a max concn of 0.1 ppb(4). 1,2-Dichloropropane was detected in 438 out of 4,972 samples from the Ohio River (1980-81) at concns of 0.1-10 ppb(5). Also detected in 14 heavily industrialized river basins in US: 5 of 204 sites positive including those in the Illinois River Basin, Delaware River Basin and Hudson River Basin at concns of 1-2 ppb(6). 1,2-Dichloropropane was detected in the Rhine River (km 865) at <1 ppb(7).

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The subjects consisted of 76 exposed workers employed in the tar distillation process and 34 controls. ... Urinary metabolite levels were corrected for specific gravity and creatinine. The time weighted average exposure concentrations in the breathing zones of the tar distillation workers were ... 0.02 to 0.04 mg/cu m for xylenols. ... The urinary xylenol levels of exposed workers ranged from 0.12 to 0.97 mg/l with specific gravity correction. In control urine samples, the specific gravity corrected xylenol concentrations ranged from 25 x 10(-3) to 43 x 10(-3) mg/l. Significant correlations were observed between the ambient levels and urinary concentrations of phenol, o-cresol, and the xylenols, with coefficients ranging from 0.45 to 0.82. The author concludes that the biological monitoring of urinary xylenols may be used as a means of measuring xylenol exposure in coke facility workers.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

In patients hypersensitive to resins based on phenol and formaldehyde and methylphenol, it is for diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive reasons necessary to know their cross-reaction patterns, which this study was therefore designed to investigate. In patients with contact allergy to a resin based on phenol and formaldehyde and at least 1 methylphenol, additional patch testing was performed with 6 methylphenol and 13 chemically related compounds. The 19 substances were tested at equimolar concentrations and in serial dilutions. Investigations by high-performance liquid chromatography were carried out to exclude contamination as the cause of the patch test reactions. Probable cross-reacting substances were o-cresol, p-cresol, salicylaldehyde, 2,4-dimethylphenol, and 2,6-dimethylphenol.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.102 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates that 2,4-dimethylphenol will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4-dimethylphenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.3 hours. There is potential for the direct photolysis of 2,4-dimethylphenol since its absorption band extends over 290 nm and thus 2,4-dimethylphenol may absorb light in the environmental UV spectrum. If released to soil, 2,4-dimethylphenol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 430. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Complete biodegradation of 2,4-dimethylphenol has occurred in 4 days within a hard, carbonaceous woody loam. The biodegradation half-life of 2,4-dimethylphenol from Texas soil and Mississippi soil was determined to be 1.5 and 3.5 days, respectively. If released into water, 2,4-dimethylphenol is expected to adsorb very little to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. 95% biodegradation was obtained for 2,4-dimethylphenol in a screening test with an adapted activated sludge seed after 5 days. In addition, it has been reported that 2,4-dimethylphenol was readily degraded in St. Lawrence River water. Biodegradation under anaerobic conditions failed to occur in one study and 48% degradation occurred after 8 weeks in another study. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 days and 22 days, respectively. A BCF of 150 in bluegill sunfish suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 2,4-dimethylphenol may occur through inhalation of this compound at workplaces where 2,4-dimethylphenol is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 2,4-dimethylphenol via inhalation of ambient air (i.e., tobacco smoke and automobile exhaust), ingestion of food (fish), and contact with other products containing 2,4-dimethylphenol.

In 1979 the EPA conducted an investigation of this area. Compound distribution at various areas about the site revealed that, in addition to groundwater leaching of soluble phenolics, insoluble contaminants were spread by a dike-breach incident and subsequent construction activities. Differences in the patterns of chemicals in various wells suggested that more than one source of pollution occurred. The distribution of compounds about the site indicated that a general clean-up would not be cost-effective. Placement of an intereceptor to collect groundwater seepage that contaminated surface water was considered as an alternative. One of the 43 compounds identified in soil extracts was 2,4-dimethylphenol.",

Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 days and 22 days, respectively(3,SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), a BCF of 150 in bluegill sunfish(6) suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). In humic waters, degradation by the reaction with peroxy radicals should ensue with a half-life on the order of hours(7). 2,4-Dimethylphenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). Screening studies indicate that 95% removal of 2,4-dimethylphenol was obtained after 5 days using an activated sludge inoculum(8). In addition, it has been reported that 2,4-dimethylphenol was readily degraded in St. Lawrence River water(9). Methanogenic consortia failed to anaerobically biodegrade 2,4-dimethylphenol after 24 days in one study(10); in two standardized anaerobic bioassays using a digester sludge, 2,4-dimethylphenol yielded no more than 10% of theoretical methane(11).",

Vapor-phase 2,4-dimethylphenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.3 hours(SRC) from its rate constant of 7.20X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). 2,4-Dimethylphenol has an absorption band at 296 nm (maximum) and extends over 320 nm, thus making it a candidate for direct photochemical degradation(5,6). Night-time degradation in urban areas should occur rapidly through reaction with atmospheric nitrate radicals, as rate constants for this reaction with phenolic compounds are approximately 250 times faster than with hydroxyl radicals(7,SRC).",

In another study, 2,4-dimethylphenol, at an initial concn of 1.22 mg/l, underwent 48% degradation when incubated in coal tar-contaminated groundwater in an anaerobic digester for 8 weeks(3). Using a 10% v/v municipal digester sludge, 20-200 mg/l 2,4-dimethylphenol yielded no more than 10% of theoretical methane in two standardized anaerobic bioassays(4).",

Night-time degradation in urban areas should occur rapidly through reaction with atmospheric nitrate radicals, as rate constants for this reaction with phenolic compounds are approximately 250 times faster than with hydroxyl radicals(4,SRC). Peroxy radicals found in humic waters react with phenols; the half-lives can be measured in hours(5). 2,4-Dimethylphenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Groundwater samples collected from three creosote- contaminated sites in Denmark, date unspecified, were found to contain 2,4-dimethylphenol ranging in concn from below detection to 2090 ug/l, analyzed with 2,5-dimethylphenol(2). 10 of 11 wells underlying a former pine-tar manufacturing facility in Gainesville, FL were found to contain 2,4-dimethylphenol ranging in concn from 1-9400 ug/l (including 2,5-dimethylphenol)(3). 2,4-Dimethylphenol was detected at a concn of 0.2 mg/l in groundwater near an abandoned wood preservative manufacturing plant in Florida(4). Water samples collected during December 1986 from Gas Works Park, Seattle, WA were found to contain 2,4-dimethylphenol ranging in concn from below detection to 1.0 mg/l(5). Studies near a wood preserving facility in Pensacola, FL detected 2,4-dimethylphenol in ground water at all four sites in a sand aquifer, concns ranging from 0-5.65 mg/l; while detected in samples from 6,12, 18, and 24 m depth, 2,4-dimethylphenol was not detected at 30 m depth(6). 2,4-Dimethylphenol was also identified in the leachate from a sanitary landfill in Barcelona, Spain(7).",

The average concn of 2,4-dimethylphenol in the groundwater near 5 wood treatment facilities sampled in the US was 1,219 ug/l(3). The concn of 2,4-dimethylphenol identified at a closed wood-to-charcoal conversion plant in McKean county, PA in 2 of 3 groundwater wells was estimated as 34 and 360 mg/l(4). At a closed, filled, landfill at Hipps Road landfill, FL, 2,4-dimethylphenol was detected in 1 of 3 groundwater wells at 13 ug/l(5). 2,4-Dimethylphenol was identified in groundwater at a unauthorized disposal site in Pemberton Township, NJ at a concn of 32 ug/l(6).",

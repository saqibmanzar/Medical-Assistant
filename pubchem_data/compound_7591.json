If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.027 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl N-phenylcarbamate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl N-phenylcarbamate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.7 hours. Ethyl N-phenylcarbamate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths <290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethyl N-phenylcarbamate is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 420. No biodegradation data were available. Volatilization from moist soil and water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.9X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyl N-phenylcarbamate will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. If released into water, ethyl N-phenylcarbamate is expected to adsorb moderately to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. An estimated BCF of 12 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process since carbamates tend to hydrolyze slowly under environmental conditions. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 2.6X10-4 L/mole-sec was estimated using a structure estimation method; this corresponds to half-lives of 840 and 84 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to ethyl N-phenylcarbamate occured through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl N-phenylcarbamate was produced or used. General population exposure should be low or non-existent since ethyl N-phenylcarbamate is no longer used in the US (May, 2005). (SRC)",

                                                    "String": "ATMOSPHERIC FATE: According to a model of gas/particle partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds in the atmosphere(1), ethyl N-phenylcarbamate, which has an estimated vapor pressure of 0.027 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2), is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl N-phenylcarbamate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.7 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.7X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). The photooxidation products of ethyl N-phenylcarbamate in benzene solution were identified as ethyl o-aminobenzoate, ethyl p-aminobenzoate, aniline, water, carbon dioxide, azo compounds, and other colored material(4). Ethyl N-phenylcarbamate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths <290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2.7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process since carbamates tend to hydrolyze slowly under environmental conditions. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 2.6X10-4 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method; this corresponds to half-lives of 840 and 84 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(2). In general, most carbamates made with aliphatic alcohols would not hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). The compound may undergo sensitized photolysis. Using a high-pressure quartz mercury vapor lamp with Pyrex glass filter, the photooxidation products of ethyl N-phenylcarbamate in benzene solution were identified as ethyl o-aminobenzoate, ethyl p-aminobenzoate, aniline, water, carbon dioxide, azo compounds, and other colored material(4). The photodegradation rate is dependent on the solvent, with a rate 7 to 10 times slower in a polar solvent (ethanol) than in a nonpolar solvent (cyclohexane)(4). Using the cyclohexane solvent, ethyl N-phenylcarbamate was mostly degraded after 3 hrs(4). Ethyl N-phenylcarbamate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths <290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

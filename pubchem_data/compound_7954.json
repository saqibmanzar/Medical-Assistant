ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

A mixture with water in an industrial reactor with refrigeration turned off developed pressure that blew gaskets and filled the building with flammable vapors.

Runaway reactions have occurred with acetone/water; methanol/water, ethoxyethanol/water, allyl alcohol/sodium hydroxide/water, 2-butanone/sodium hydroxide/water, and methanol/sodium bicarbonate [Loss Prev. Bull., 1979, (25), 21]. Reacts with methanol to give gaseous methyl chloride. Reacts rapidly with bicarbonates to generate gaseous carbon dioxide. Reacts vigorously with dimethyl formamide (DMF) to form carbon dioxide after a deceptive induction period [BCISC Quart. Safety Summ., 1960, 35, 24]. Can react with reducing agents to generate heat and products that may be gaseous (causing pressurization of closed containers). The products may themselves be capable of further reactions (such as combustion in the air).",

Investigations included anamnesis, physical examination (with special attention to lungs, skin and eyes), lung function (forced expiratory volume) and blood pressure measurements. Medical records of another 21 workers previously exposed to incidental high concentrations, who had changed jobs in the mean time, were checked. Determination of concentrations at the workplace. Samples (30-60 min) were taken during the filling procedure (worst case) and during normal production procedures (both room and personal monitoring). The samples were analyzed after adsorption tosilicagel, desorption with H2SO4, hydrolysis to cyanuric acid (70 min at 70 \u00b0C) and analysis of the cyanuric acid by HPLC with UV detection. No effects on any of the measured parameters were found. FEV was within normal ranges. Accidental acute exposure to high doses of cyanuric chloride was reported to lead to irritation/corrosion of the conjunctiva and skin irritation. After inhalation of the test substance coughing, breathing problems and shortness of breath were seen. These effects disappeared completely after a short time and did not result in persisting problems. Measured concentrations were 7.09  = or -  9.22 ug/cu m, 4.43  = or -  2.72 ug/cu m and 92.76  = or -  147.52 cu m, for filling, room and personal monitoring, respectively.",

Concentration levels and mortality data are as follows: 0.0 (0/10 M, 0/10 F), 5.0 (0/9 M, 0/9 F), 7.0 (0/9 M, 0/9 F), 18.4 (1/9 M, 0/9 F), 40.5 (6/9 M, 0/9 F), 108 (9/9 M, 6/9 F), and 495 mg/cu m (9/9 M, 9/9F). Clinical signs included a dose-related increase in dyspnea, chromodacryorrhea, rhinorrhea, cyanosis, diarrhea, tremors, and ruffled fur as well as lateral, ventral and curved body position. A significant decrease in body weights was noted in both sexes at 40.5 mg/cu m and depressed body weights and weight gains at 108 mg/ cu m. Pathological findings revealed an area of discoloration of the lungs in all exposure groups. At 40.5 mg/cu m, enlarged or edematous lungs in 6/9 males was present, and similar findings were noted in 7/9 males and 6/9 females in the 495 mg/cu m group. Also noted was dilation of the stomach in 1 male in the 108 mg/cu m group and for females was 88 mg/cu m group.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.023 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cyanuric chloride will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase cyanuric chloride is degraded slowly in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4,300 days. Cyanuric chloride does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, cyanuric chloride is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 120. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.9X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process given the estimated vapor pressure of cyanuric chloride. If released to water, cyanuric chloride is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids or sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc value. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important environmental fate process given the estimated Henry's Law constant. Hydrolysis is the dominant environmental fate process for cyanuric chloride. A suspension of cyanuric chloride in ice water was stable for about 12 hours; however, at 30 \u00b0C, over 40% hydrolyzed to cyanuric acid within 1 hour. Complete anaerobic degradation of 250-500 uM of cyanuric chloride solutions incorporated into a methanogenic aquifer slurry was observed after a one year time period; however, the likely mechanism of degradation was hydrolytic dehalogenation rather than microbial degradation. An estimated BCF value of 2, as well as the rapid rate of hydrolysis, suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyanuric chloride is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

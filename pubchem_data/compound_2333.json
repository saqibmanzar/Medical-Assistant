The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Furthermore, it was used widely for many years without reports of hepatotoxicity until the late 1980s, after which several cases of acute liver injury and acute liver failure during benzbromarone therapy were published. Hepatic injury arises after 1 to 6 months of therapy presenting with jaundice and fatigue, usually with a hepatocellular pattern of enzyme elevations. Immunoallergic symptoms (rash, fever) are uncommon. Low levels of autoantibodies have been reported in some cases with liver histology demonstrating chronic active hepatitis, particularly if benzbromarone is not stopped promptly. Upon stopping therapy, resolution is typically within 1 to 3 months. The hepatic injury from benzbromarone is similar to that reported with benzarone, a structurally related drug that was used for peripheral vascular disease, but also withdrawn also because of concerns over hepatotoxicity.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.058 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diethyl adipate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase diethyl adipate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Diethyl adipate may undergo direct photolysis in the environment, but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown. If released to soil, diethyl adipate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 45. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on the vapor pressure of this compound. Diethyl adipate was degraded to adipic acid using an activated sludge inoculum in a single screening study. If released into water, diethyl adipate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 and 110 days, respectively. Hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 64 days and 1.7 years at pH 8 and 7, respectively. An estimated BCF of 6 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to diethyl adipate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diethyl adipate is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), from a vapor pressure of 0.058 mm Hg(4) and its water solubility(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 and 110 days, respectively(SRC). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 0.12 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(5); this corresponds to half-lives of 1.7 years and 64 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(5). Diethyl adipate was degraded to adipic acid using an activated sludge inoculum(6), suggesting biodegradation may be an important fate process in water(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 6(SRC), from its water solubility and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).",

Vapor-phase diethyl adipate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days(SRC), calculated from its estimated rate constant of 7.8X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) determined using a structure estimation method(3). Diethyl adipate may also undergo direct photolysis in the environment since this compound contains functional groups that can absorb light greater than 290 nm(4).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

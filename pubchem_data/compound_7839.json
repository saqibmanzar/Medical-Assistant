It also occurs naturally in small amounts in the ocean where it is formed, probably by algae and kelp. It is a colorless liquid with a mild, sweet odor. Other names for 1,2-dibromoethane are ethylene dibromide, EDB, and glycol bromide. Trade names include Bromofume and Dowfume. 1,2-Dibromoethane has been used as a pesticide in soil, and on citrus, vegetable, and grain crops. Most of these uses have been stopped by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) since 1984. Another major use was as an additive in leaded gasoline; however, since leaded gasoline is now banned, it is no longer used for this purpose. Uses today include treatment of logs for termites and beetles, control of moths in beehives, and as a preparation for dyes and waxes.",

Animal studies indicate that chronic exposure to ethylene dibromide may result in toxic effects to the liver, kidney, and the testis, irrespective of the route of exposure. Limited data on men occupationally exposed to ethylene dibromide indicate that long-term exposure to ethylene dibromide can impair reproduction by damaging sperm cells in the testicles. Several animal studies indicate that long-term exposure to ethylene dibromideincreases the incidences of a variety of tumors in rats and mice in both sexes by all routes of exposure.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The GST route is associated with carcinogenicity. An approach is presented to use human purified GST and P450 enzymes to explore the importance of these metabolic pathways for man in vivo. This strategy basically consists of four steps: (i) identification of the most important isoenzymes in vitro, (ii) scaling to rate per milligram cytosolic and microsomal protein, (iii) scaling to rate per gram liver, and (iv) incorporation of data in a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. In the first step, several GST isoenzymes were shown to be active toward EDB and displayed pseudo-first-order kinetics, while the EDB oxidation was catalyzed by CYP2E1, 2A6, and 2B6, which all displayed saturable kinetics. In the second step, the predictions were in agreement with the measured activity in a batch of 21 human liver samples. In the third step, rat liver P450 and GST metabolism of EDB was predicted to be in the same range as human metabolism (expressed per gram). Interindividual differences in GST activity were modeled to determine \"extreme cases.\" For the most active person, an approximately 1.5-fold increase of the amount of conjugative metabolites was predicted. Lastly, it was shown that the GST route, even at low concentrations, will always contribute significantly to total metabolism. In the fourth step, a PBPK model describing liver metabolism after inhalatory exposure to EDB was used. The saturation of the P450 route was predicted to occur faster in the rat than in man. The rat was predicted to have a higher turnover of EDB from both routes. Nevertheless, when all data are combined, it is crucial to recognize that the GST remains significantly active even at low EDB concentrations. The limitations and advantages of the presented strategy are discussed.",

EDB is used as a nonflammable solvent for resins, gums, and waxes. Additionally, EDB can be used as a raw material in the synthesis of chemicals such as vinyl bromide (a precursor of flame-retardants) and styrenic block copolymers.",

Liquid bromine is continuously added above the packed section while a slight excess of ethylene is continuously fed countercurrently from the bottom of the packed section. The exothermic reaction between ethylene and bromine occurs in the liquid phase on the surfaces of the cooling coils, and heat is removed at a rate sufficient to maintain a maximum temperature of 100 \u00b0C and the section of the column. Some reaction also occurs in the gas phase above the bromine feed where product is condensed and separated from the vent gas (ethylene, hydrogen bromide, and interact material). As the crude liquid product passes downward through the packed section, it provides a contacting surface for rising ethylene to convert any residual dissolved bromine. Ethylene dibromide is continuously withdrawn from the reactor into a hold-up tank where it is irradiated with ultraviolet light to eliminate minor amounts of unconverted starting materials.",

It also occurs naturally in small amounts in the ocean where it is formed, probably by algae and kelp. It is a colorless liquid with a mild, sweet odor. Other names for 1,2-dibromoethane are ethylene dibromide, EDB, and glycol bromide. Trade names include Bromofume and Dowfume. 1,2-Dibromoethane has been used as a pesticide in soil, and on citrus, vegetable, and grain crops. Most of these uses have been stopped by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) since 1984. Another major use was as an additive in leaded gasoline; however, since leaded gasoline is now banned, it is no longer used for this purpose. Uses today include treatment of logs for termites and beetles, control of moths in beehives, and as a preparation for dyes and waxes.",

Ethylene dibromide is extremely toxic to humans. The chronic (long-term) effects of exposure to ethylene dibromide have not been well documented in humans. Animal studies indicate that chronic exposure to ethylene dibromide may result in toxic effects to the liver, kidney, and the testis, irrespective of the route of exposure. Limited data on men occupationally exposed to ethylene dibromide indicate that long-term exposure to ethylene dibromide can impair reproduction by damaging sperm cells in the testicles. Several animal studies indicate that long-term exposure to ethylene dibromideincreases the incidences of a variety of tumors in rats and mice in both sexes by all routes of exposure. EPA has classified ethylene dibromide as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health  and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1,  1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in  accordance to newer safety standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection  Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the  effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for  human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than  those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List  D. Ethylene dibromide is found on List B. Case No: 2235; Pesticide type: insecticide; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered. Therefore, we are characterizing the case as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): ethylene dibromide; Data  Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 10/13/92; AI Status:  The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered products. Thus, we characterize it as \"cancelled.\"",

Historically, the primary use of 1,2-dibromoethane has been as a lead scavenger in antiknock mixtures added to gasolines. Another major past use of 1,2-dibromoethane was as a pesticide and an ingredient of soil and grain fumigants and for post-harvest application. 1,2-Dibromoethane has been used as a chemical intermediate in the manufacture of resins, gums, waxes, dyes, and pharmaceuticals and as a high-density, nonflammable solvent. HUMAN STUDIES: 1,2-Dibromoethane has produced oral ulcerations, followed by liver and renal toxicity. Cases of fatal poisoning have been reported. It was a DNA damaging agent when tested in human lymphocytes, but positive results were noted only after metabolic activation. ANIMAL STUDIES: Dogs exposed for 1 to 1.5 hr to vapor of 1,2-dibromoethane developed clouding of corneas several hours after removal from the exposure chamber. Rats tolerated exposure to 25 ppm 1,2-dibromoethane in air over 7 hr/day for 151 days, but 63 similar exposures to levels of 50 ppm were lethal to 20-50% of animals. Deaths from acute exposure were usually due to lung congestion and hemorrhage although liver and kidney damage, as well as corneal injury, were also observed. 1,2-Dibromoethane caused tumors in rats and mice at several different tissue sites and by several different routes of exposure. Inhalation exposure to 1,2-dibromoethane caused cancer of the nasal cavity and the blood vessels in rats of both sexes and in female mice; benign or malignant lung tumors in mice of both sexes and in female rats; and benign or malignant mammary gland tumors in females of both species. It also caused testicular tumors in male rats and cancer of the subcutaneous tissue in female mice. Dermal exposure to 1,2-dibromoethane caused lung and skin tumors in female mice. In mice, administration of 1,2-dibromoethane in the drinking water caused forestomach tumors in both sexes and benign tumors of the esophagus in females. Some of the male reproductive effects of ethylene dibromide in the human have been modelled in the rabbit, although the rabbit appears not to be as sensitive, since semen parameters were affected only at doses close to the LD50 (55 mg/kg). When given ip at dose of 10 mg/kg on 5 successive days to rats it damaged spermatogenic cells. Two to three weeks after start of oral treatment of bulls with 4 mg/kg bw 1,2-dibromoethane on alternate days, abnormal spermatozoa were observed, indicating interference with spermatogenesis and with maturation of spermatozoa in epididymis. Fetal abnormalities were observed when pregnant rats and mice were exposed at 31.6 ppm 1,2-dibromoethane for 23 hr a day during the 6th-15th days of gestation. 1,2-Dibromoethane bound covalently to liver DNA of rats treated in vivo. It was selectively lethal to DNA-repair-deficient bacteria, and provoked DNA repair in cultured mammalian cells. It was mutagenic to bacteria, fungi, vascular plants, insects and cultured mammalian cells in the absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. It induced chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in cultured mammalian cells. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: 1,2-Dibromoethene showed low toxicity to most aquatic species tested. It was phytotoxic for green plants and germinating seed.",

Conjugation with glutathione (GSH) has been shown to play a role in the bioactivation of EDB. The aim of this study was to determine whether activation of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, which causes a decrease in cellular GSH levels, could modulate the nephrotoxicity of EDB. For this purpose, male ICR mice were treated with EDB and/or the alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (Pe), or the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine (Phe). Animals treated with EDB (40 mg/kg, i.p.) had a 9.3-fold increase in urinary gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGTP: EC 2.3.2.2) activity and a 38% decrease in renal non-protein bound sulfhydryl (NPSH) levels; however, animals co-treated with EDB and Pe (50 mg/kg, i.p.) exhibited a 27.8-fold increase in urinary GGTP activity and a 60% decrease in NPSH levels. The enhanced presence of urinary GGTP and decrease in cellular levels of NPSH was nearly blocked by treating animals concomitantly with EDB and Phe (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or EDB, Pe, and Phe. Histopathological examination revealed the enhanced degree of tissue damage and necrosis following treatment with EDB and Pe, and the protective effect of Phe at ameliorating EDB toxicity. These results indicate that factors that can influence alpha-adrenergic receptors may be critical in assessing dose-response data used in the risk assessment process.",

Initial medical examination: A complete history and physical examination: The purpose is to detect existing conditions that might place the exposed employee at increased risk, and to establish a baseline for future health monitoring. Examination of the nervous and respiratory systems, heart, liver, and kidneys should be stressed. The skin should be examined for evidence of chronic disorders. A 14\" by 17\" chest roentgenogram: Ethylene dibromide causes human lung damage. Surveillance of the lung is indicated. Forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume (1 sec): Ethylene dibromide is a respiratory irritant. ... Liver function tests: Ethylene dibromide may cause liver damage. A profile of liver function should be obtained by utilizing a medically acceptable array of biochemical tests. Cardiac /function/: ... An electrocardiogram should be performed on workers over 40 years of age and where indicated. Skin: Ethylene dibromide is a defatting agent and can cause dermatitis. Periodic Medical Examination: The aforementioned examinations should be repeated on an annual basis.",

Historical releases of EDB have resulted in detectable EDB in groundwater and drinking wells, and recently concentrations up to 16 ug/L were detected in ground water at two fuel spill plumes in the vicinity of the Massachusetts Military Reservation Base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Because the ground water in this area is used to flood cranberry bogs for the purposes of harvesting, the U.S. Air Force sponsored the development of aquatic screening benchmarks for EDB. Acute toxicity tests with Pimephales promelas (Fathead minnow), Daphnia magna, and Ceriodaphnia dubia were conducted to provide data needed for development of screening benchmarks. Using a closed test-system to prevent volatilization of EDB, the 48-hr LC50S (concentration that kills 50% of the test organisms) for P. promelas, D. magna, and C. dubia were 4.3 mg/L, 6.5 mg/L, and 3.6 mg/L, respectively. The screening benchmark for aquatic organisms, derived as the Tier II chronic water quality criteria, is 0.031 mg EDB/L. The sediment screening benchmark, based on equilibrium partitioning, is 2.45 mg EDB/kg of organic carbon in the sediment. The screening benchmarks developed here are an important component of an ecological risk assessment, during which perhaps hundreds of chemicals must be evaluated for their potential to cause ecological harm.",

Their toxicity to bacteria (Microtox(R)), microalgae (Chlorella sp.), cladocerans (Ceriodaphnia dubia), duckweed (Lemna sp.) and midges (Chironomus tepperi) was determined after careful optimization of the test conditions to minimize chemical losses throughout the tests. In addition, concentrations of DBE and TriBE were carefully monitored throughout the bioassays to ensure accurate calculation of toxicity values. 1,2-Dibromoethene showed low toxicity to most species, with concentrations to cause 50% lethality or effect (LC/EC50 values) ranging from 28 to 420 mg/L, 10% lethality or effect (LC/EC10 values) ranging from 18 to 94 mg/L and no-observed-effect concentrations (NOECs) ranging from 22 to 82 mg/L. 1,1,2-Tribromoethene was more toxic than DBE, with LC/EC50 values of 2.4 to 18 mg/L, LC/EC10 values of 0.94 to 11 mg/L and NOECs of 0.29 to 13 mg/L. Using these limited data, together with data from the only other published study on TriBE, moderate-reliability water quality guidelines (WQGs) were estimated from species sensitivity distributions. The proposed guideline trigger values for 95% species protection with 50% confidence were 2 mg/L for DBE and 0.03 mg/L for TriBE. The maximum concentrations of DBE and TriBE in nearby surface waters (3 and 1 ug/L, respectively) were well below these WQGs, so the risk to the freshwater environment receiving contaminated groundwater inflows was considered to be low, with hazard quotients <1 for both VOCs.",

Ethylene dibromide's former uses as a pesticide and antiknock agent in gasoline resulted in its direct release to the environment(SRC). Monitoring of ethylene dibromide in ocean water and ocean air suggests that ethylene dibromide may be formed naturally in the ocean as a result of macro algae growth. Phaeophyta (brown algae) are known to produce ethylene dibromide at 20-30 ng/g wet algal weight per day. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 11.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethylene dibromide will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethylene dibromide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 64 days. Ethylene dibromide does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethylene dibromide is expected to have high to very high mobility based upon Koc values ranging from 14 to 160. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.50X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Ethylene dibromide is expected volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process. Biotransformation lifetimes in soil can be as short as several days in surface soils and as long as many months in aquifer materials. In one laboratory screening study using 100 soils, half-lives ranged from 1.5 to 18 weeks. The field dissipation half-life has been reported to range from 28-180 days. If released into water, ethylene dibromide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Microbial degradation rates in water can vary greatly with observed half-lives ranging from roughly a week to 350 days. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.9 hours and 6.0 days, respectively. BCFs ranging from <1 to 14.9 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Ethylene dibromide hydrolyzes very slowly in pure water with half-life of 6.4 years at 25 \u00b0C. However hydrolysis catalyzed by the presence of various natural substances (such as hydrogen sulfide ion, half-life in 1-2 months) may have some importance as a degradation mechanism. Occupational exposure to ethylene dibromide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethylene dibromide is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ethylene dibromide via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

The release of ethylene dibromide by polar algae (brown, red and green) was investigated at 0 \u00b0C under a laboratory setting(3). Phaeophyta (brown algae) produced ethylene dibromide at 20-30 ng/g wet algal weight per day while red and green algae produced negligible amounts(3).",

Ethylene dibromide is used as a chemical intermediate for producing pharmaceuticals, herbicides and dyes(3). It is used as a nonflammable solvent for resins, gums and waxes(3). The largest single application of ethylene dibromide was its former use in leaded gasolines as an antiknock agent, but this use declined dramatically starting in 1974 due to regulation of lead content in gasoline by the EPA(3). The second-largest traditional use of ethylene dibromide was an insect fumigant and soil nematocide; however, in 1983, the EPA banned this use in most agricultural applications(3). Ethylene dibromide's former use as a pesticide resulted in its direct release to the environment(SRC).",

Volatilization of ethylene dibromide from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 6.50X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(2). Ethylene dibromide is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 11.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4). Biodegradation can be a primary degradation process in soil(2,5). A review of biodegradation data pertaining to ethylene dibromide concluded that ethylene dibromide can be biotransformed fairly readily in the environment(5); lifetimes can be as short as several days in surface soils and as long as many months in aquifer materials(5). Persistence can vary greatly from soil to soil. In one laboratory screening study using 100 soils, half-lives ranging from 1.5 to 18 weeks were determined(6). In one field, ethylene dibromide was detected in soil 19 years after its last known application(7); the long persistence was the result of entrapment in intraparticle micropores of the soil(7). The field dissipation half-life of ethylene dibromide has been reported to range from 28-180 days(8).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.50X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.9 hrs and 6.0 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), BCFs ranging from <1 to 14.9 (5,6), suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Degradation screening studies have demonstrated that ethylene dibromide is predominately biodegraded in aquatic conditions via comparison of sterile versus non-sterile conditions(7,8). Degradation rates can vary greatly. Three day die-away tests using Japanese river and seawater observed moderate degradation (21-35% degradation)(9). Microbial degradation in microcosms using shallow aquifer material and groundwater found ethylene dibromide degraded aerobically in all samples with half-lives ranging from 35-350 days(10). Biodegradation in a methanogenic aquifer at 17 \u00b0C (and 194 ug/L) had a half-life of two weeks with bromoethanol was detected as a metabolite(11). Ethylene dibromide hydrolyzes very slowly in pure water with half-life of 6.4 years at 25 \u00b0C(12). However hydrolysis catalyzed by the presence of various natural substances (such as hydrogen sulfide ion, half-life in 1-2 months) may have some importance as a degradation mechanism(13).",

Vapor-phase ethylene dibromide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 64 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.50X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The transformation products from the reaction of ethylene dibromide with hydroxyl radical in the atmosphere includes formaldehyde, bromoethanol, hydrogen bromide, and formyl bromide(4). Ethylene dibromide does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).

In three day die-away tests using Japanese river and seawater, ethylene dibromide was observed to have moderate degradation (21-35% degradation)(2). Low concentrations of ethylene dibromide (<100 ug/L) were biotransformed completely within 2 weeks by a reductive dehalogenation under methanogenic conditions in a continuous-flow column(3); sterile controls showed that some abiotic degradation was also occurring, but microbial degradation was dominant(3). In a microcosm study simulating methanogenic conditions found in aquifer material, ethylene dibromide was found to biodegrade relatively rapidly(4); after 16 weeks of incubation, greater than 99% of initial ethylene dibromide was transformed(4); in sterile controls, only 20% was transformed after 40 weeks(4). Biodegradation of low concentrations of ethylene dibromide in groundwater microcosms was enhanced by addition of phenol(5).",

A review of available biodegradation data pertaining to ethylene bromide concluded that ethylene dibromide is biotransformed fairly readily in the environment(2); lifetimes can be as short as several days in surface soils and as long as many months in aquifer materials(2). In about two months, ethylene dibromide was converted almost completely and quantitatively to ethylene in a soil culture at an initial concentration of 188 g/L ethylene dibromide(3). Disappearance in soil at 100 mg/kg and 20 \u00b0C under aerobic laboratory conditions: half-life =< 2.0 days(3). Ethylene dibromide, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test; however, degradation determination was affected by major removal via volatilization(4). Using a closed-bottle protocol with a non-adapted activated sludge inoculum, ethylene dibromide (at 15 mg/L) was found to be not readily biodegradable with only 4.2% degradation after 28 days of incubation(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 64 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). The neutral hydrolysis rate of ethylene dibromide was experimentally determined to be 2.1X10-7/minute at 25 \u00b0C which corresponds to a half-life of 6.4 years(3). Alkaline hydrolysis studies at 25 \u00b0C found the hydrolysis rate was determined by the neutral hydrolysis(3). An extrapolated hydrolysis half-life of 13.2 years was reported for ethylene dibromide at pH 7 and 20 \u00b0C(4). The aqueous hydrolysis rate is catalyzed by the presence of phosphate buffering agents(5); in pure distilled water at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7, the half-life is 6.0 yrs while in phosphate buffer the half-life falls to 2.0 yrs(5). The presence of naturally occurring sulfur species (HS ion) dramatically increases the aqueous hydrolysis rate from several years (in pure or buffered solution at 25 \u00b0C) to 37-70 days (in the presence of HS)(5). The UV absorption spectra of ethylene dibromide indicates it does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Ethylene dibromide did not directly photolyze when exposed to UV light between 300 and 400 nm(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The samples represent urban and rural area drinking-water wells. Ethylene dibromide was not detected in any urban wells (n = 406) and was detected in 8 of 2,542 rural wells (0.3%) at a median concentration of 0.9 ug/L. From 1971 to 1991, groundwater monitoring studies were conducted by federal state and local governments throughout the US(2). Ethylene dibromide was detected above the MCL (maximum concentration limit (MCL) = 0.05 ug/L) in 2,918 wells out of 20,221 wells sampled and analyzed for this compound. In California, 1,638 wells were sampled from 1979-89 with 45 >MCL (concentrations ranging from 0.006-4.7 ug/L); in Connecticut, 2,392 wells were sampled in 1987 with 469 >MCL and 315 wells <MCL (concentrations ranging from 0.02-8.0 ug/L); in Florida, 14,949 wells were sampled from 1979-91 with 1,552 > MCL and 411 wells <MCL (concentrations ranging from 0.01-755.0 ug/L); in Georgia, 76 wells were sampled from 1981-87 with 7 >MCL and 3 wells <MCL (concentrations ranging from 0.02-110.0 ug/L); in Hawaii, 371 wells were sampled from 1979-87 with 15 >MCL and 13 wells <MCL (concentrations ranging from 0.001-15772.4 ug/L); in Indiana, 174 wells were sampled from 1987-89 with 6 >MCL and 2 wells <MCL (concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.85 ug/L); in Massachusetts, 239 wells were sampled in 1985 with 25 > MCL and 11 wells <MCL (concentrations ranging from 0.03-6.9 ug/L); in Oregon, 161 wells were sampled from 1985-87 with 10 >MCL and 10 wells <MCL (concentrations from 0.034-0.172 ug/L; in Washington, 181 wells were sampled from 1984-89 with 21 >MCL and 2 wells <MCL (concentrations ranging from 0.018-6.3 ug/L)(2). The concentration of ethylene dibromide in groundwater has been monitored in the Fresno/Clovis CA area from 1979-1993(3). Due to extensive farming in the region, ethylene dibromide, used as a pesticide, leached into well water. The study found that the concentration of ethylene dibromide decreased in concentration in 1979-80 well water samples from 0.25 ppb to 0.15 ppb in 1992-93. During the first cycle of the National Water Quality Assessment (1992-96), groundwater in 20 of the nation's major hydrologic basins was analyzed for 90 pesticide compounds(4). Ethylene dibromide was detected in 0.27% of 1,831 sites analyzed at a maximum concentration of 1.40 ug/L. Between 1975 and 1991, the California Department of Pesticide Regulation found that ethylene dibromide had contaminated 54 wells in California at a maximum concentration of 380 ug/L and was one of the most frequently detected pesticides in groundwater(5). A Danish groundwater monitoring program conducted between 1993-2001 detected ethylene dibromide (0.01 ug/L detection limit) in 3 of 715 samples at a median concentration of 0.56 ug/L(6).",

Ethylene dibromide levels exceeding the US EPA health advisory (0.02 ug/L) were found at 18 wells. At one study site, levels as high as 6.17 ug/L were observed (308 times the US EPA health advisory level). Researchers found that the concentration of ethylene dibromide varied throughout the year, principally due to precipitation events. While the initial ethylene dibromide level was 1.69 ug/L in one well, concentrations varied significantly during the 27-month study including a high of 2.29 ug/L and a low of 0.94 ug/L(1). High precipitation created a pulse of aquifer infiltration diluting groundwater concentrations of ethylene dibromide followed by ethylene dibromide infiltration from overlying soils which tended to re-establish prior concentrations. Groundwater monitoring studies conducted in the Central Valley of California from 1984-1990 were reviewed for ethylene dibromide detections(2). A review of the papers found that ethylene dibromide was detected in 29 of 709 wells sampled. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection analyzed groundwater from Sept 1st to Dec 31st 1996, in an area of 930 sq km within the Philadelphia Metropolitan region(3). A network of 78 shallow groundwater monitoring wells was installed to assess the quality of recently recharged groundwater in the Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer system. Ethylene dibromide was not detected at a detection limit of 0.036 ug/L(3). From July 1st 1994 to June 30th 1995, the Department of Pesticide Regulation in California analyzed well water throughout the state of California for pesticides(4). Out of 1607 wells sampled, ethylene dibromide was detected 15 times (concentration ranging from 0.01-0.11 ppb). It was detected in the following counties: 5 times in Fresno, 4 times in Kern, once in Los Angeles, once in Merced, 3 times in Riverside, and once in Tulare(4).",

In the Netherlands, the maximum concentration of ethylene dibromide was 0.1 ppb(2). A study of 1926 rural private drinking water wells in the US during a time-frame of 1986-1999 found ethylene dibromide contamination in 0.19% of the wells(3). Tap water collected during 1997-1998 at Tres Rios Arizona (near Phoenix, AZ) had an ethylene dibromide concentration of 11 ug/L(4). Samples of untreated groundwater from 1255 domestic drinking-water wells and 242 public supply wells were analyzed as part of the National Water-Quality Assessment Program of the US Geological Survey between 1992 and 1999; ethylene dibromide concentration exceeded 0.05 u/L in 3 samples(5). The US EPA analyzed drinking water data from more than 20,000 public drinking water systems in a 16-state national cross section (serving more than 110 million people) and ethylene dibromide was detected above the EPA MCL (maximum contaminant level of 0.05 ug/L) in 0.72% of the systems(3).",

Toxic air contaminants were measured near a busy highway in downtown Porto Alegre, Brazil, from 3/20/96 to 4/16/97 and ethylene dibromide was not detected at a detection limit of 0.1 ppb(2). Volatile organic compound levels in breath, personal air and fixed-site (indoor and outdoor) air were sampled in 1987 and compared for a sample of 50 individuals in the Los Angeles area of California(3). Although ethylene dibromide was not detected in breath, personal air or kitchen air samples, it was detected in 11 of 459 outdoor air samples (detection limit = 0.22 ug/cu m). A critical review of Chemical Abstract files from 1967 to November 1992, National Technical Information Service files from 1964 through November 1992, and other sources of information including review articles, reference books, technical journals and the National Ambient VOC Database indicated that ethylene dibromide was not detected at 65 different urban locations in 2,201 air samples(4). The concentration of ethylene dibromide ranged from 0.001-0.17 ug/cu m in London, England and was as high as 1.2-1.8 ug/cu m on a garage forecourt(5). Outdoor air sampled at 75 residence houses in Ottawa, Canada during the winter of 2002/2003 did not detect ethylene dibromide (detection limit of 0.02 ug/cu m)(6).",

Levels of ethylene dibromide near groups of petroleum stations and along well traveled highways were around 11 ug/cu m. It has been found in concentration of ethylene dibromide of up to 96 ug/cu m up to mile away from US Dept of Agriculture fumigation center(4). Measurements were made of 1,2-dibromoethane vapor released from oranges that had been fumigated on laboratory scale (0.25 carton) on a large scale (400 cartons)(5). The decay of the outgassing rate over time was approximately first order(5). Outgassing was significantly slowed by reducing either the temperature or the air ventilation rate(5). Absorption of ethylene dibromide by the cardboard packing material reduced the amount absorbed by the oranges but did not otherwise affect outgassing behavior(5). Air concentrations of ethylene dibromide in ventilated containers dropped from several ppm immediately after fumigation to a few ppb after 5-10 days(5); levels remained between 2 and 3 ppm for 15-20 days during unventilated, refrigerated storage(5).",

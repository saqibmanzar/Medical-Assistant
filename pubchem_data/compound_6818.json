PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.4X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-ethylhexyl butyl phthalate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-ethylhexyl butyl phthalate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 25 hours. Particulate-phase 2-ethylhexyl butyl phthalate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2-Ethylhexyl butyl phthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-ethylhexyl butyl phthalate is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.5X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Based on a study using an inoculum obtained from soil and sewage sludge, 2-ethylhexyl butyl phthalate underwent >99% primary biodegradation and 87% mineralization under aerobic conditions in 28 days, indicating biodegradation in soil and water is expected to take place. If released into water, 2-ethylhexyl butyl phthalate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 32 and 240 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 50 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 640 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. However, bioconcentration studies on compounds which are structurally similar suggest that bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated by the regression-derived equations due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 4.2 years and 150 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to 2-ethylhexyl butyl phthalate may occur through inhalation of aerosols and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-ethylhexyl butyl phthalate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-ethylhexyl butyl phthalate via dermal contact with products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 32 and 240 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 50 years if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 640(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 6.5(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). However, bioconcentration studies on compounds that are structurally similar suggest that bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated by the regression-derived equations due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds(9). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process(SRC) based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 4.2 years and 150 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively(10). 2-Ethylhexyl butyl phthalate underwent 84.5% biodegradation in a semi-continuous activated sludge test under aerobic conditions in 24 hrs; complete degradation was observed in three days during an activated sludge die-away test under aerobic conditions(11).",

According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). However, bioconcentration studies on compounds which are structurally similar suggest that bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated by the regression-derived equations due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds(4).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

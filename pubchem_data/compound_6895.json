When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Fasted animals were given single doses of 10 mg/kg of the (14)C labeled isomers by gavage. Serial sacrifices were performed at 0.5, 1, and 24 hr and 1, 2, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days post administration. Radioassays utilized the liver, kidneys, spleen, brain, pancreas, lung, heart, thigh muscle, skin, perirenal fat, testes, bladder, adrenals, epididymis, seminal vesicles, prostate, gastrointestinal tract, blood, and salivary glands. The data for each tissue was fitted to a linear compartmental pharmacokinetic model. The amount of (14)C excreted in urine and feces was determined daily for 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene and 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene isomers. Radioactivity from the labeled isomers appeared in the blood and tissues within 30 min of administration, peaked at approximately 4 hr, and slowly declined to background levels. Radioactivity attributed to 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene dropped to background levels after 28 days. The bladder, kidney, fat, skin, liver, and adrenals showed high 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene activity up to 24 hr post treatment. Radioactivity due to 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene dropped to background levels after 56 days for liver, fat, and skin and 28 days for the other tissues. The highest 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene concentrations were found in liver, fat, kidney, and bladder. Significant levels of radioactivity from 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene remained in the tissues after 56 days for all tissues examined. Approx 85% of 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene and 92% of the 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene were excreted within 24 hr of dosing. Compartmental analysis showed 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene to have the highest values for the linear coefficients of exponential decay.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Thirteen groups of weanling Sprague Dawley rats were given one of the trichlorobenzenes, at concentrations of 1, 10, 100, or 1000 ppm in corn oil, or corn oil alone. After 13 wk all animals were anesthetized with ether and exsanguinated via the abdominal aorta. Clinical examination showed no signs of toxicity except reduced wt gain in some groups. High dose groups of treated males had a general trend towards lower wt gain with statistically significant wt gain suppression only seen in males treated with 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene at 10 of 1000 ppm. The liver to body wt ratios of males receiving the highest doses of the three trichlorobenzenes were significantly higher than controls. Kidney wt were higher for some groups of males. trichlorobenzene exposure did not affect serum sodium, potassium, inorganic phosphate, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transferase, total protein, calcium, cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, or any hematological or urinary parameter. Hepatic microsomal aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine demethylase activities were significantly elevated in males fed 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 1000 ppm. Aminopyrine demehtylase activity was significantly elevated in females. Histopathologic changes related to treatment were seen in liver, thyroid, and kidney for all three isomers. The changes were mild in nature and judged to be significant only at the highest dose level, but they were more severe in males than in females. Microscopic changes in the liver consisted of mild to moderate increases in cytoplasmic volume and anisokaryosis of hepatocytes. Changes in the thyroid included reduction in both follicular size and colloid density. Only 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene resulted in mild to moderate renal changes in the convoluted tubules which were characterized by eosinophilic inclusions, enlargement and anisokaryosis of the lining cells and hyperplasia of the tubular epithelial cells. Only changes associated with the 1000 ppm dose level of the isomer were considered to be biologically significant. It was concluded that the nonobservable adverse effect levels for all three trichlorobenzene isomers are 100 ppm and from data on the 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene levels found in lake trout (5 ppb) and estimated average fish consumption, that there is a 5.6x10+6 times safety factor between the potential human exposure and the effect level as seen in the rat.",

From this mixture 0.22, 2.2, or 22 mg was added per liter drinking water representing concentrations being three orders of magnitude higher than found in several water wells. Most of the changes found in body weight, hematology and pathology correlated with intercurrent diseases or were in accordance with background pathology. With respect to incidence and time of occurrence of tumors, no significant differences were found between the control and the high dose group when lifespan correction was applied. Thus it is concluded that in the present study no significant toxic or carcinogenic effects are induced by lifetime exposure of rats to a mixture of volatile halogenated hydrocarbons in the drinking water.",

Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were administered 150 and 300 mg/kg 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, or 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg of 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene or 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene. Chemicals were given by gavage on day six through day fifteen of gestation. Dams were assessed for toxic effects and distribution of chemicals in tissues, and fetuses were examined for toxic and teratogenic effects. Dams did not exhibit any signs of toxicity, although there was a tendency toward a dose related reduction in body weight. Abnormalities in pregnancy outcome and fetal development did not appear to be related to treatment. Maternal liver weights were increased by all three isomers, and other organ weights were normal. Significant dose related increases in liver aminopyrine-N-demethylase activity were found for 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. Dose related increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit occurred with all three compounds. Histology revealed maternal liver changes and eye lens lesions in 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene exposed fetuses. Mild thyroid changes were also noted in dams.",

These compounds were found to produce growth rate reduction in mosquito fish fry at concentrations as low as 0.30, 0.18, 0.025, and 0.010 umol/L for 1,4-dibromobenzene, 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene, 1,2,4-tribomobenzene, and pentachlorobenzene, respectively. The aqueous exposure concentrations causing growth rate reduction of 50 and 10% (EC50 and EC10, respectively) for the halobenzenes were 0.067-3.4 and 0.0042-0.32 umol/L, respectively. The EC50 and EC10 values are within the ranges of 5 to 8% and 0.1 to 3.9% of the LC50 values, respectively. The percentage of growth rate reduction relative to the LC50 could possibly be used to describe chronic toxicity effects of organic compounds with the aquatic organisms. The internal concentrations obtained from the analysis for the halobenzenes were generally consistent with the calculated internal concentrations. The lipid-based internal concentrations that gave 50 and 10% growth rate reductions were 8.3-27 and 0.5-1.6 umol/kg, respectively. These values have a more limited range than the corresponding external aqueous concentrations. The quantitative structure-activity relationships between the internal concentrations at 50 and 10% growth rate reduction and physicochemical parameters were found to be less satisfactory than those based on external aqueous concentrations.",

The zebrafish. Danio rerio, was used as a test organism, and the two model compounds were 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene, a non-polar narcotic, and parathion, an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. Hatching and survival after 28 days were significantly reduced in the highest 123TCB treatment (263 ug/L), but not in any of the parathion treatments. Growth of the larvae was negatively affected at parathion concentrations above 20 ug/L, while AChE was only significantly inhibited at the highest concentration, 93 ug/L. No effects on growth were found in the 123TCB treatments. In comparison with acute and chronic studies with both compounds, the ELS test turned out to be less sensitive than chronic studies and more sensitive than acute studies. The difference in sensitivity between the tests systems seems however, to depend on the mode of action of the compound.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.21 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 57 days. In the laboratory, 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene irradiated at wavelengths greater than 285 nm has been shown to undergo both direct and sensitized dechlorination and isomerization. If released to soil, 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene is expected to have low to no mobility based upon Koc values of 1380 to 7943. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.25X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 1,2,3-Trichlorobenzene is expected to biodegrade slowly in soils and water with biodegradation half-lives ranging from several weeks to several months. If released into water, 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.9 hours and 5.6 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 65 days if adsorption is considered. BCFs of 130 in carp to 245,470 in fathead minnow, suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound or other products containing 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene.

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.9 hours and 5.6 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), BCF values of 130 in carp(7) to 245,470 in fathead minnow(2), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). 1,2,3-Trichlorobenzene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Biodegradation of 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene is expected to occur slowly, with half-lives ranging from several weeks to several months(8-10).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

A grab sample test using a Nixon sandy loam showed 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene degraded at an average rate of 0.35 nmol/day(2-3). The half-life for 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene at various locations in the Rhine River was estimated at 1.9, 21 and 30 days, but this may have included other processes besides biodegradation(4). 1,2,3-Trichlorobenzene underwent detectable biodegradation to trichlorophenols within 24 hr using a soil culture adapted to benzene(5). 1,2,3-Trichlorobenzene showed a 65.5% theoretical biological oxygen demand using an activated sludge inoculum(6). 1,2,3-Trichlorobenzene did not degrade in soil studies using a pure culture seed under conditions in which the other trichlorobenzene isomers had degraded(7). 1,2,3-Trichlorobenzene was dechlorinated 0.3-50.1% after 7 days incubation in soil amended with 4 mM bromoethanesulfonate, 2 mM sulfate and 7.5 mM hydrogen(8). After 4 days of incubation, 28 uM of 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene was biodegraded to 1,2- and 1,3-dichlorobenzene(9).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

A mean BCF value of 430 was measured for mosquito fish exposed to 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene(2). Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and guppy (Poecilia reticulata) had BCFs of, respectively, 710 and 702 wet weight, but were calculated as 22,188 and 13,000 based on lipid weight(3). 1,2,3-Trichlorobenzene had a BCF of 1862(4), and a log BCF of 2.90(5) in guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Log BCFs were measured, on a whole body basis, in Atlantic croaker, blue crab, spotted sea trout, blue catfish, guppy and fathead minnow at 2.89, 2.47, 1.58, 3.01, 3.28, and 3.00-3.75, respectively, and in 2 samples of rainbow trout at 3.08 and 3.42; using lipid basis, log BCFs were 4.54, 4.77, 3.22, 4.49, 4.11, and 3.94-5.39, respectively, and 4.17, 4.48 for rainbow trout(6).

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

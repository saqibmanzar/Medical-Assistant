When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Low concentrations of the phenylurea component were detected at 6 hr, but it was not detected at 18 hr. The pyrimidone component was found at considerably higher concentrations, which increased between 6 and 18 hr. Qualitatively similar findings were obtained in rats given oral doses of 0.1, 1, or 5 mg/kg bw per day for eight days and killed 4 or 24 hr after the last dose. The blood concentrations of the pyrimidone component were dose-related, while those of the phenylurea component showed a flat response. In the latter experiment, urine collected for 5 hr after the last dose contained dose-related concentrations of each component of nicarbazin, although the concentrations of the pyrimidone were an order of magnitude higher than those of the phenylurea component",

The concentrations of both the DNC and 4,6-dimethyl-2-hydroxypyrimidine (DHP) components of the drug in eggs were proportional to feed levels. The maximum feed nicarbazin concentration of 12.1 mg/kg (8.6 mg/kg DNC and 3.5 mg/kg DHP) gave rise to mean maximum whole egg concentrations of 631 micrograms/kg DNC and 51.8 micrograms/kg DHP. After withdrawal of the experimental diet, DNC was undetectable in eggs after 12 days and DHP after 3 days. Feed contaminated with nicarbazin at concentrations greater than about 2 mg/kg gave rise to egg DNC residues at concentrations greater than the Differential Action Limit (DAL) set by the UK (100 micrograms/kg). DNC was contained almost entirely in the yolk of the egg, whereas DHP was distributed between albumen and yolk in a ratio of approximately 3:1.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The actual intakes were 0, 60, 180, or 600 mg/kg bw/day of the phenylurea component and 0, 20, 60, or 200 mg/kg bw/day of the pyrimidone component. Two animals of each sex per group were killed after one year. Clinical observations were made daily, and body weight, food consumption, and reflexes were determined weekly; water intake and urinary output were measured monthly. Hematological, clinical chemical, and urinary parameters were determined before treatment and in months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24. A wide range of tissues from all dogs was examined grossly and microscopically. ...No abnormal behavior or physical signs were seen; however, one male at the intermediate dose died of unknown causes during week 44. A green-to-yellowish hue was seen in the excreta of all treated dogs. Body-weight gain, food intake, and hematological and urinary parameters were unaffected by treatment. Serum alanine aminotransferase activity was increased in several dogs at the highest dose and in one dog at each of the lower doses, but in most cases the effects were transitory. The highest values were observed at about 12 months, and elevated activity persisted in only two animals at the high dose. Organ weights and gross pathological appearance revealed no treatment-related changes. The histopathological appearance was unremarkable, apart from slight bile-duct proliferation in one dog killed after one year of treatment with the high dose. This animal had been found to have elevated serum alanine aminotransferase activity. Although the relationship between the hepatic findings and treatment was unclear, the conservative NOEL in this study is 240 mg/kg bw day.",

The groups consisted of 50 males and 50 females for control and the high doses and 40 males and 40 females for the low and intermediate doses. Five rats of each sex from the control and high-dose groups were killed during months 6 and 18, and 10 rats of each sex per group were killed in week 56. The animals were observed daily for behavior, physical appearance, and survival. Food consumption and the efficiency of food use were assessed weekly for the first 12 weeks and then periodically on 15 animals of each sex per group. Body weight was recorded weekly for the first 12 weeks, then biweekly until week 26 and monthly thereafter. Water intake and urinary output were measured on 10 rats of each sex per group during one week per month for the first three months. Limited hematological, clinical chemical and urinary parameters were examined on 10 rats of each sex per group at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.

Changes in the kidney, such as calcareous material in the tubules, calcification in the renal pelvis, tubules, glomeruli, or medulla, and calculi, were more frequent in treated groups at 56 weeks, but the overall incidence was similar in all groups at the end of the study. The incidence of testicular atrophy was slightly elevated in some treated males at 104 weeks, but significance was not attained. Tumor incidences were unaffected. The NOEL was 400 mg/kg bw/day of the 3:1 mixture.",

Treatment was administered continuously during the production of 2 litters per generation for 3 successive generations. The initial groups of animals were paired 10 weeks after the start of treatment to produce the F1a litter and were paired again 7 days after weaning of the first litter to produce the F1b litter. At 4 weeks of age, 12 male and 12 female F1b offspring were mated according to the above schedule to produce the F2a and F2b litters, and the F2b offspring were used to produce the F3a and F3b litters. The animals were examined daily for survival, behavior, and appearance. Body weight and food consumption were measured weekly in adults. After birth, each litter was limited to 8 pups, which were weighed at birth and on postnatal days 4, 12, and 21. After the offspring had been weaned, the adult rats were autopsied, and the testes of F2 males in the control and high-dose groups were examined histopathologically. The liver, kidneys, heart, urinary bladder, and gonads from 5 male and 5 female F3b weaned pups from each group were also examined microscopically. ...Adult rats of each generation showed no effects on survival, body-weight gain, or food intake, and the results of gross autopsy and testicular examinations were unremarkable. The pregnancy rates and duration of gestation were unaffected. The body-weight gain of F1b pups at the high dose was slightly depressed during lactation, but a similar effect was not found in any other litter. In subsequent generations, the F2a and F3a litters at the high dose had slightly fewer pups, but the effect was not reproduced in the F2b or F3b litters. Histopathological examination of limited organs from F3b pups revealed no abnormalities attributable to treatment, and it was considered that there were no significant effects on reproduction. The NOEL was the highest dose tested, 400 mg/kg bw/day of the 3:1 mixture.",

Details of the method were not given in the report, but the tabulated results indicate that food and  water intake and body weights were recorded daily on gestation days 7-21. The times of sacrifice of dams and examination of fetuses were not indicated. Fetuses were subjected to external, visceral, and skeletal examinations. Since the protocol was not provided, it is not known whether a recognized test guideline was followed or if quality assurance was undertaken, and the adequacy of the study could not be determined.  Seven rats at 600 mg/kg bw per day died, mostly during the treatment period. The food intake and body-weight gain of dams at 600 mg/kg bw per day were depressed from gestation day 8. Implantations and in-utero survival were similar in all groups, while fetal body weight was lower at 600 mg/kg bw per day. The fetuses of the dams at 600 mg/kg bw per day had delayed ossification, hyperplastic and bent ribs (four fetuses), sacralization of the 6th or 7th lumbar vertebrae (two fetuses), cleft palate (two in same litter), subcutaneous edema (three in same litter), hydronephrosis (five fetuses), cryptorchismus (one fetus), and remained Merkel's diverticulum (one fetus). The NOEL for maternal and fetal toxicity was 200 mg/kg bw per day.",

Low concentrations of nicarbazin fed in the diet will adversely impact avian reproduction (which is to be expected given its mode of action). For example, significantly reduced egg production and hatchability of fertile eggs was reported at a dietary concentration of 25 ppm when fed to chickens for only four days, and eggshell pigmentation was reduced after only two days of feeding. These effects were even more pronounced at dietary concentrations of 50 and 100 ppm. In several studies, negative impacts on egg hatchability in chickens fed 20 ppm nicarbazin in the diet for only 9 to 10 days have been reported in several studies.

By the 2nd week of nicarbazin treatment, egg production was significantly reduced in birds fed 125 and 200 ppm (P<0.05). Similarly, increasing levels of nicarbazin resulted in decreasing egg weights (P<0.01) and feed intake was significantly decreased. By the 2nd week post-nicarbazin treatment, egg production, egg weight, and feed intake had returned to normal. Nicarbazin had no effect on egg shell deformation or body weight. 125 and 200 ppm reduced hatchability significantly (P<0.01) as well as producing an increased incidence of malpositions and malformations. When nicarbazin was withdrawn from the diet, hatchability returned to pretreatment values although malpositions and malformations were still in evidence.

Fecal 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) and fluorescein were evaluated as potential markers of plasma and egg DNC levels. Plasma, egg, and fecal DNC levels differed among treatment groups in a dose response relationship. There were no significant effects on the numbers of eggs laid per female per day, proportion of fertile eggs, proportion of eggs hatching, or egg yolk mottling. Hatchability was 0.55 +/- 0.1 in the control group compared with 0.26 +/- 0.1 in the 33.75 mg/kg of BW group. Degeneration of the vitelline membrane was evident at all treatment levels; severity was dose-related and greater in the outer vitelline membrane than the inner vitelline membrane. No significant health effects were observed for birds treated with NCZ. The heterophil:lymphocyte ratio was elevated during the treatment and posttreatment periods in all groups, indicating birds were experiencing stress due to handling. Fecal DNC levels did not correlate well with plasma DNC levels, likely due to NCZ being administered as a bolus dose rather than being fed ad libitum. Fluorescein correlated well with plasma DNC levels during the treatment period and can therefore be used successfully as a noninvasive marker to determine the approximate amount of NCZ a bird is consuming. ...",

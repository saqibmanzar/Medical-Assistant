ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Injection of 55 mmol 1,3-butanediol/kg body weight at 24 h of recirculation and again at 36 hr following 10 min of forebrain ischemia markedly reduced damage to CA1 neurons examined at 72 hr of recirculation compared with that in saline-treated rats. Comparable treatment with ethanol did not cause significant protection. Neuronal loss was also not reduced by 1,3-butanediol treatment when the ischemic period was extended to 15 min or by single treatments at 24 hr or 36 hr following 10 min of ischemia. However, a single treatment 5 min after reversal of 10 min of ischemia was effective in ameliorating cell loss. The difference in effectiveness of 1,3-butanediol following 10 min and 15 min of ischemia is consistent with a number of previous studies, indicating that the processes leading to loss of CA1 neurons are modified when the ischemic period is extended. Previous findings that 1,3-butanediol reduced damage in other ischemia-susceptible neuronal subpopulations but not in CA1 neurons most likely reflected the longer period of ischemia which was used. The results of the present investigation demonstrate that administration of 1,3-butanediol offers a novel approach for interfering with post-ischemic loss of CA1 neurons following a brief ischemic period which is effective even when initiated after prolonged recirculation periods.",

In the present study, we show that and the specific complex I inhibitor rotenone produces a similar neurochemical profile in the striatum, consistent with an effect of AOAA on energy metabolism. Lesions produced by AOAA were dose-dependently blocked by MK-801, with complete protection against GABA and substance P depletions at a dose of 3 mg/kg. AOAA lesions were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with either 1,3-butanediol or coenzyme Q10, two compounds which are thought to improve energy metabolism. These results provide further evidence that AOAA produces striatal excitotoxic lesions as a consequence of energy depletion and they suggest therapeutic strategies which may be useful in neurodegenerative diseases.",

To evaluate the efficacy of short-term, pre-partum feeding of 1,3-butanediol on pig and sow productivity on a large scale and low concentration was the focus of the research. The secondary objective was to determine if pre-partum feeding of 1,3-butanediol had any effect on survival rate and weight gain of lesser body weight pigs, sow body weight and subsequent sow reproductive performance. In a large commercial unit, 2537 sows were fed one of two pre-partum diets (0% or 4.55% 1,3-butanediol) on Day 108+/-3 of pregnancy. 1,3-butanediol provided 8% of the total metabolizable energy. Pigs born live in those litters were equalized by cross-fostering among sows receiving the same pre-partum diet. Pigs were weaned from the sows at 16+/-3 days post-partum and return of sows to estrus and conception rates were determined. Pre-partum feeding of 1,3-butanediol reduced (P=0.01) pre-weaning pig mortalities from 1.44 to 1.24 pigs per litter. The reduction in pig mortality was independent of length of 1,3-butanediol feeding (4 to 11 days). In a subset of 750 litters, four lesser birth-weight pigs from each litter were tagged and monitored to determine the effect of 1,3-butanediol on survival rates and pre-weaning weight gain of pigs with the greatest mortality risk. 1,3-butanediol reduced (P=0.01) pre-weaning mortality of these low birth weight pigs by 5.27%. Based on these data, short-term pre-partum feeding of 1,3-butanediol effectively improves pre-weaning pig productivity at a lower concentration than previously reported.",

Acetaldehyde conversion cannot be carried higher than 66.6% because aldol and acetaldehyde combine to yield 2,6-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-4-ol. The bound acetaldehyde is held so tenaciously that most commercial aldol is essentially equivalent to 2,6-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-4-ol: Higher condensation products are often present. It is difficult to decompose 2,6-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-4-ol into aldol without simultaneously dehydrating it to crotonaldehyde. Steam stripping is one of the most practical ways of removing the bound acetaldehyde. Aldol is led directly to a hydrogenation system where it is reduced in the presence of Raney nickel or other catalysts. Any of the acetaldehyde or 2,6-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-4-ol left is reduced to ethanol and 2,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane, both of which are efficiency losses for the process. Low-boilers are striped from the hydrogenated product and pure 1,3-butylene glycol is obtained by distillation under reduced pressure.",

The corresponding ketoacids, acetoacetate and beta-ketopentanoate, can be assayed simultaneously by pretreating the samples with NaB2H4. The assays involve spiking the samples with deuterated internal standards, deproteinization, ether extraction, and derivatization of the carboxyl groups with (R,S)-2-butanol/HCl and of the hydroxyl groups with chiral (S)-(+)-2-phenylbutyryl chloride. Mass spectrometric analysis is conducted under ammonia positive chemical ionization. We used these assays to follow the metabolism of diol enantiomers in dogs. For (R,S)-1,3-butanediol and (R,S)-1,3-pentanediol, the uptakes from dog plasma of the R and S enantiomer of each diol were identical. In contrast, the metabolism of (S)-1,2-propanediol was faster than that of (R)-1,2-propanediol. (R)-1,2-Propanediol is formed during acetone metabolism, while (R,S)-1,3-butanediol and (R,S)-1,3-pentanediol are potential nutrients.",

It is used as an intermediate in manufacture of polyester plasticizers; humectant for cellophane, tobacco; and in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry as a glycerin substitute.1,3-Butanediol also has some mold inhibiting action. It is not registered for current pesticide use in the U.S., but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: 1,3-Butanediol is not irritating to human skin or mucous membranes.  When applied to the human eye it causes immediate severe stinging, but irrigation with water brings rapid complete relief.  ANIMAL STUDIES: Eye irritation occurred in one individual, although its irritant potency in rabbits appeared low. It was of low acute oral toxicity to rodents. No treatment-related effects on mortality, body weight gain, organ weights, hematology, histopathology or neoplastic changes were observed in rats fed 1,3-butanediol in the diet at 1, 3 or 10% (~ 643, 1960 or 6230 mg/kg-bw/day for males or ~ 844, 2330 or 7300 mg/kg-bw/day for females) for two years.  Feeding studies in which 1,3-butylene glycol replaced carbohydrate as an energy source found central nervous system effects in rats, dogs and calves. 1,3-Butanediol decreased glucose and increased beta-hydroxybutyrate in lactating goats fed 1,3-butanediol in their diets.1,3-Butylene glycol was fetotoxic when fed to rats during pregnancy, and a multigeneration feeding study in rats gave some indication of reduced male fertility. No genotoxic activity (dominant lethality or chromosomal damage) was seen in rats treated orally.",

The present study provides additional information concerning the quantitative relationship between the severity of the ketotic state produced by BD and the magnitude of the potentiation observed and emphasizes the use of ketone bodies (KB) to predict the potential hazard of the BD-CCl4 interaction. Liver damage was modulated in male Sprague-Dawley rats by varying the concentration of the BD solutions ingested prior to a CCl4 challenge (0.1 ml/kg, i.p.). These data were compared to ketone bodies in plasma, hepatic tissue and urine. BD produced a dose-dependent metabolic ketosis observable at dosages between 1.1 and 9.9 g/kg per day given for 7 days. Plasma and liver data correlated well together. Concomitantly, potentiation of the CCl4-induced liver injury was also dose-related for the same dosage range; the minimum effective dosage of BD for potentiation was estimated as 1.1 g/kg per day. The linear correlations between hepatic or plasma KB values and the indices of hepatic dysfunction (ALT, OCT) were highly significant. Using a semiquantitative method, a correlation was also found for the urinary KB data. These results suggest that plasma KB concentrations might be useful for predicting possible potentiation of the hepatonecrotic effect of CCl4 by BD.",

Butanediol plus phlorizin and fasting caused 18% and 19% decreases of plasma glucose and 2.5- and 6-fold increses of free fatty acid concentrations in blood plasma. Glucose irreversible loss averaged 371, 541, and 182 g/day during control, butanediol plus phlorizin treatment, and fasting.

Standard therapy for EG intoxication in administration of ethanol (ETOH) to inhibit its metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Studies indicate 1,3-butylene glycol (BG) binds to ADH more efficiently than EG and is orally less toxic than EG or ETOH. Male rats were divided into 5 groups of 6 animals. Groups received by oral intubation a single dose of EG (32 mmole/kg), BG (39 mmole/kg) initially and every 6 hr up to 72 hr, ETOH (39 mmole/kg) initially and every 6 hr up to 72 hr, or EG initially and then either BG or ETOH every 6 hr up to 72 hr. Administration of ETOH produced hepatotoxicity and pulmonary pathology as indicated by changes in clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and histopathology, while BG did not. Neither ETOH nor BG produced any apparent nephrotoxicity. ETOH produced ataxia, lethargy and central nervous system depression while BG did not. BG produced a higher concentration of urinary EG indicating a better inhibition of ADH metabolism of EG. Ethanol produced a higher EG blood concentration than BG. Ethanol's higher EG blood concentration may be partially attributed to dehydration and a decreased urine output as well as inhibition of ADH metabolism. Ethanol produced mortality in all animals prior to 72 hr. The EG/ETOH combination produced mortality more quickly due to additive toxicity of the combination. Lack of any significant toxicity produced by BG and the production of significant toxicities by ETOH indicates that BG is potentially a better antidote than ETOH.",

In the present study, oral treatment (10 g/kg) with racemic 1,3-butanediol and each of its enantiomers (R-1,3-butanediol and S-1,3-butanediol) induced NDMA demethylase activity by approx 1.5-fold in rat hepatic microsomes obtained 12 hr later, suggesting an induction of P450IIEl, the acetone/ethanol-inducible form of p450. The results agreed with an immunochemically determined increase in the levels of this isozyme. No change in p450 content, NADPH cytochrome-c reductase, or in pentoxyresorufin dealkylase activity were detected. Blood levels of acetone were determined during a 10-hr period after 1,3-butanediol administration and showed a higher initial rate of increase by R-1,3-butanediol, possibly due to steroselective metabolic oxidative metabolism. However, no difference in the induction of NDMA demethylase activity by the enantiomers could be detected. Induction of P450IIEl probably contributes to the previously described potentiation of haloalkane-induced hepatotoxicity by 1,3-butanediol administration.",

Its former use as an aircraft de-icing agent resulted in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.02 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,3-butanediol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,3-butanediol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours. 1,3-Butanediol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,3-butanediol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. 1,3-Butanediol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the modified Sturm test, 80.5% biodegradation was reached in 28 days indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 1,3-butanediol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,3-butanediol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,3-butanediol is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,3-butanediol via ingestion of food, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 1,3-butanediol. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 1,3-butanediol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.32X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). 1,3-Butanediol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

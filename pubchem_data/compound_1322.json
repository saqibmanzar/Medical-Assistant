Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Fifteen to 30 minutes after sc administration of (3)H labeled SDMH, which induces colonic tumors, marked radioactivity was found in blood, bile, urine & in contents of all regions of gastrointestinal tract. SDMH methylated DNA, RNA and proteins of intestinal mucosa, liver and kidney to a high degree. A carcinogenic SDMH metabolite forms in the liver, a conjugate with glucuronic acid. This glucuronide enters the gut both with bile and directly via the circulation. Microbial beta-glucuronidase releases the active metabolite which, in turn, alkylates tissue macromolecules.",

Investigation has shown that study of whole liver does not localize alkylation or repair capacity in different cells types which give rise to neoplasia. Although hepatocytes account for >90% of the liver's mass, they only comprise 60-70% of its cells. The non-parenchymal cell population, which consists almost entirely of endothelial and kupffer cells, accounts for the remaining 30-40% and contains 10-20% of the DNA. The alkylation and repair of O6 and 7-methylguanine in the target and nontarget cells following oral administration of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine to rats was studied. Although initial formation of O6-methylguanine was less in DNA of non-parenchymal, removal of O6-methylguanine was significantly slower. This led to administration /of/ a 2nd daily dose. 7-methylguanine decreased at similar rates resulting in a 28 fold greater O6-methylguanine/7-methylguanine ratio in the target cell population.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Benign and malignant tumors incr by 3.4 fold, adenomas by 3.5 fold, and adenocarcinomas by 3.25 fold over the yield found in the group fed a fiber free diet. Consumption of wheat bran, after completion of carcinogen exposure, reduced the yield of benign adenomas by 71.4% when compared with the group fed the fiber free diet. Those rats fed a wheat bran supplement during carcinogen admin and then switched to a fiber free diet afterwards had the highest tumor yield, 4.5 times as many benign and malignant tumors as in those rats consistently fed the fiber free diet and greater than or equal to 6 times as many adenomas as any of the other dietary groups.",

Female rats were give 13 different doses of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (from 1.4 to 135,000 ug/kg) and the subsequent hepatic DNA damage was determined by the alkaline elution technique. DMH doses below 450 ug/kg did not significantly damage DNA; all DMH doses of 1000 ug/kg or higher damaged rat hepatic DNA (P<0.05). In this study the x values (dose) ranged over five orders of magnitude and the y values (DNA damage) ranged 30-fold. Ten different regression models (linear, quadratic, cubic, power, and six nonlinear transition models) were compared in their ability to fit the experimental data. With respect to log transformed dose, the six nonlinear transition equations fit the data considerably better than the four power type of equations. A sigmoid model fit to the log transformed dose of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine had an r2 of 0.9979, a degree of freedom adjusted r2 of 0.9969, a F-statistic of 1,457, and a fit standard error of 0.50. With respect to untransformed dose, only three equations (sigmoid, cascade and gaussian cumulative) could creditably fit the DMH data. The experimental results are interpreted with respect to hormesis, use of log transformed dose, sigmoid dose-response models, thresholds of biological response and cancer risk assessment.",

Vapor-phase 1,2-dimethylhydrazine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 3 hours. Reaction with atmospheric ozone may also be an important fate process. Although an estimated half-life is not available for the reaction of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine with ozone, half-lives ranging from 0.28 to 22 hours were estimated for monomethylhydrazine, 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, and tetramethylhydrazine. If released to soil, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine is expected to have very high mobility based on an estimated Koc of 25. 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine is a weak base with an estimated pKa of 7.9, suggesting that it will partially exist in the protonated form in water and moist soils and the protonated form may adsorb to soils more than the free base. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces will not occur for the protonated species since cations do not volatilize. Volatilization may occur for the neutral species based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.5X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilization of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine from dry soils may exist based on the vapor pressure of this compound. No soil degradation data for 1,2-dimethylhydrazine were located; however, 1,1-dimethylhydrazine was degraded 0, 11, 11, and 50% in cleaned sand (100% sand), sandy soil, organic soil, and clay soil, respectively in a 1 hour soil column study. If released to water, the neutral species of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based on the estimated Koc value; however, the protonated form may have greater adsorption. The protonated form will not volatilize, but the free base may volatilize based on the estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives from a model river and model lake were 4 and 40 days, respectively for the free base. 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine reacts directly with oxygen in water and is considered labile in water containing oxygen; the half-life for this reaction in water was estimated to be less than 10 days. In the presence of traces of metal ions commonly found in natural waters, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine is rapidly dehydrogenated to azomethane. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation or dermal contact at workplaces where 1,2-dimethylhydrazine is produced or used. Since only limited quantities of this chemical are used, the general population is unlikely to be exposed to 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 1,2-dimethylhydrazine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 3 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.3X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Reaction with atmospheric ozone is also expected to be significant. Although an estimated ozone half-life is not available for 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, half-lives ranging from 0.28 to 22 hrs can be estimated from measured rate constants for monomethylhydrazine, 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, and tetramethylhydrazine(4).",

Biodegradation may be a significant removal process at low concentrations in soils or ambient waters, but at higher concentrations hydrazines are toxic to microorganisms(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

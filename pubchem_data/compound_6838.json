PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Guinea pigs showed the most rapid excretion of N-nitrosodiphenylamine into the bile. Rabbits had the slowest excretion of N-nitrosodiphenylamine into the bile, but the most rapid elimination of the chemical from the bile. Both excretion to and elimination from bile were comparatively slow in the rat. The half-lives for N-nitrosodiphenylamine elimination from bile for these species are as follows: 95 minutes for rabbits, 240 minutes for guinea pigs, and 510 minutes for rats.",

The present study aims at investigating the role of N-nitrosamines in the alteration of homocysteine, lipid profile, oxidative stress, paraoxonase activity, antioxidant enzymes, and free radicals which are important risk factors for CVD. In addition, biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases such as creatine kinase MB activity (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as protein expression of both glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase p isozyme were assayed after treatment of rats with 0.2 mg/kg body weight of N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA), N-nitrosoethylbutylamine (NEBA), N-nitrosobutylpropylamine (NBPA), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPA) as a daily dose for two weeks. LDL levels, paraoxonase activity, reduced glutathione levels, and glutathione reductase activities were increased, whereas HDL levels decreased after treatment of rats with most of N-nitrosamines compared to control group. Moreover, levels of free radicals and catalase activity increased, whereas protein expression of both glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase decreased after treatment of rats with some N-nitrosamines. The data showed that most N-nitrosamines increased CK-MB and LDH activities. It is concluded that N-nitrosamines increased levels of free radicals, and decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes which may consequently increase the incidence of CVDs.",

The MIPs were successfully prepared using the method of precipitation polymerization and using methacrylic acid as the functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the cross-linker, and N, N-Diphenylformamide as the template molecule. The newly synthesized MIPs were characterized and used as SPE sorbents. Under the optimized conditions, the average recoveries of NDPhA spiked in ultrapure water were higher than 94% +/- 2.9% at three different concentrations and the limit of detection and limit of quantitation were 0.8?ng?L-1 and 2.4ng/L, respectively. Moreover, the high selectivity of MIPs was attained and the satisfactory recoveries of NDPhA which were spiked in to real samples were achieved in the range of 92-107% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) within 0.3-7.9%. The low levels of NDPhA were detected in the two of twelve wastewater samples with concentrations of 5.6 ng/L and 3.6 ng/L with RSDs of 5.6% and 2.8%, respectively. The developed MIP-SPE method was proved to be practically feasible for selective extraction and enrichment of NDPhA in real water samples.",

Nitrate was first removed from urine by an anion-exchange procedure that prevented the significant loss of various added reference NOC and unidentified urinary NOC. The total NOC were then determined by injecting the urine sample (nitrate content less than 1 mmol l-1) or anion-exchange eluate into refluxing ethyl acetate containing either acetic acid for determining heat and acetic acid labile thermal energy analyser responsive compounds (TAC) or into hydrogen bromide for the determination of TAC and NOC. The nitrogen monoxide levels released were measured using thermal energy analysis with chemiluminescence detection, and the differnce between the two determinations represented the concentrations of NOC. The optimum conditions for preventing artefactual nitrosation in urine samples by the addition of sodium hydroxide or sulphamic acid without decomposition of NOC were determined. The influence of time and storage conditions on NOC stability was investigated. Fifteen urine samples collected from volunteers dosed with proline were analysed for total NOC and N-nitrosamino acids revealing a preponderance of unknown NOC. The determination of total NOC in human urine using this group-selective method offers a new approach to the estimation of human exposure to NOC and to isolate hitherto unknown NOC and their metabolites. /N-nitroso cmpd/",

The most probable route of exposure to this yellow crystalline substance is by inhalation during its use in rubber processing. Effects from exposure include contact burns to the skin and eyes. In activities or situations where over exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and protective clothing. If contact should occur, immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, and remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. N-Nitrosodiphenylamine may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames; burning with a flare-like effect and the possible production of irritating or poisonous gases. Fires involving N-nitrosodiphenylamine may be extinguished with dry chemical, sand, water spray, fog, or foam. For a massive fire, use unmanned hose holders. Before shipping N-nitrosodiphenylamine, consult with the regulatory requirements of the US Department of Transportation. Small spills of N-nitrosodiphenylamine may be taken up and placed into clean, dry containers, covered, and removed from the spill area. Large spills should be wetted down and diked for later disposal. N-Nitrosodiphenylamine is a potential candidate for rotary kiln and fluidized bed forms of incineration. Before implementing land disposal of waste N-nitrosodiphenylamine, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

NDPHA is an effective radical scavenger, and can be used to stabilize monomers, polymers and petroleum products. In rubber processing, its major use is believed to be as an anti-scorching agent, or vulcanization retarder, during rubber compounding. It is also used to make p-nitrosodiphenylamine. HUMAN STUDIES: NDPHA did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in human foreskin fibroblasts treated with up to 400 ug/mL. ANIMAL STUDIES: In an acute study of hepatotoxicity, mice given 350 mg/kg/day of NDPHA for 4 consecutive days preceding, or one dose 24 hours prior to, pentobarbital administration had effects characteristic of liver enzyme induction. In another study, rats and mice were fed diets containing up to 46000 mg/kg NDPHA for seven or 11 weeks. Female rats did not survive doses greater than 16000 mg/kg of diet; female mice survived higher doses. Male rats and male mice were not killed by the highest doses tested (10000 and 22000 mg/kg of diet, respectively). Rats were exposed to NDPHA by dietary feed at concentrations of 0, 250, 1000, 2000, 3000 or 4000 ppm for 5 days, 2, 4 and 13 weeks duration. There were no NDPHA exposure-related clinical signs of toxicity. NDPHA at a dose of 250 ug/mL did not induce DNA repair in Escherichia coli in the presence of metabolic activation. In several studies, doses of up to 2500 ug/plate NDPHA did not induce reversions in Salmonella typhimunum strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1536, TA1537, TA 1538, G46, C3076 or 03052 in the presence of metabolic activation.",

N,N-Diphenylamine (DPhA), a denitrosated derivative of NDPhA, was also mutagenic to S. typhimurium TA98 when norharman was present. Twice as many revertants were induced by DPhA with norharman as by NDPhA with norharman. The comutagenic effect of norharman was also observed with N-nitroso-methylphenylamine (NMPhA), N-nitrosoethylphenylamine (NEPhA) and N-nitrosophenylbenzylamine (NPhBeA) and their denitrosated derivatives. NDPhA was converted metabolically to DPhA by S9 mix. Stoichiometric studies indicated that the mutagenicity of NDPhA in the presence of norharman was exerted through DPhA. The denitrosation eyzme activity of NDPhA was mainly recovered in the microsomal fraction, and the enzyme seemed to be a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system. Denitrosation reactions of NMPhA, NEPhA and NPhBeA were also demonstrated. The mutagenicities of these compounds with norharman are therefore suggested to be due to a mechanism similar to that of NDPhA with norharman.",

The formation of phenazine from diphenylamine (DPhA) chloramination was studied and its cytotoxicities for two human cancer cells were also investigated. Phenazine was detected synchronously with the consumption of DPhA by chloramination, which further confirmed that the new DBP phenazine can be produced along with N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA) from DPhA chloramination. The formation of phenazine had a maximum molar yield with solution pH increasing from 5.0 to 9.0, with phenazine as the main product for DPhA chloramination at lower pH, but higher pH favored the formation of NDPhA. Thus, solution pH is the key factor in controlling the formation of phenazine and NDPhA. Both the initial DPhA and chloramine concentrations did not show a significant effect on the molar yields of phenazine, although increasing the chloramine concentration could speed up the reaction rate of DPhA with chloramines. The cytotoxicity assays showed that phenazine had significant cell-specific toxicity towards T24 (bladder cancer cell lines) and HepG2 (hepatic tumor cell lines) cells with IC50 values of 0.50 and 2.04 mmol/L, respectively, and T24 cells being more sensitive to phenazine than HepG2 cells. The IC50 values of phenazine, DPhA, and NDPhA for T24 cells were of the same order of magnitude and the cytotoxicity of phenazine for T24 cells was slightly lower than that of NDPhA (IC50, 0.16 mmol/L), suggesting that phenazine in drinking water may have an adverse effect on human health.",

These effects consisted of significantly decreased pentobarbital sleeping time and increased amounts of smooth endoplasmic reticulum among granules of glycogen in the liver cell. Electron microscopy also revealed blebs, hypertrophy, and pleomorphism of the mitochondria. A NOAEL of 350 mg/kg/day was identified for hepatic effects, since light microscopy examination did not reveal hepatic lesions.",

The level of reduced glutathione decreased significantly between 37 and 70% after the treatment of male mice with ethylbutylnitrosamine (-37%), diphenylnitrosamine (-50%), propylbutylnitrosamine (-52%), diethylnitrosamine (-54%), ethylmethylnitrosamine (-55%), and dibutylnitrosamine (-70%), whereas methylpropylnitrosamine increased the level of reduced glutathione by 71%. All the N-nitrosamine compounds tested increased the activity of glutathione reductase except ethylmethylnitrosamine had no effect. The activity of glutathione S-transferase activity was inhibited after treatment of the male mice with diphenylnitrosamine (-60%), dibutylnitrosamine (-60%), and methylpropylnitrosamine (-81%), while, ethylmethylnitrosamine and ethylbutylnitrosamine had no effect on such activity. On the other hand, diethylnitrosamine increased the activity of glutathione S-transferase by 50%. It can be postulated from this study that the chemical structure of N-nitrosamines plays a significant role in the alteration of reduced glutathione level and reduced glutathione metabolizing enzymes, since the substitution of different groups on the nitroso group was found to be capable of causing an alteration in such activities.",

The present study shows the influence of N-nitroso compounds on the activities of the above-mentioned enzymes. Single-dose treatment (20 mg/kg body weight) of male mice with ethylbutylnitrosamine, propylbutylnitrosamine, or dibutylnitrosamine: increased (1) the activity of dimethylnitrosamine N-demethylase I by 108%, 104%, 51%, respectively; (2) the cytochrome P-450 content by 106%, 72%, 51%, respectively; (3) the activity of arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase by 95%, 106%, 80% respectively; (4) the cytochrome b5 content by 164%, 97%, 94% respectively; and (5) decreased the activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase by 55%, 50% and 45%, respectively. Methylpropylnitrosamine decreased the activity of dimethylnitrosamine N-demethylase I by 44% and the P-450 content by 50%. Diphenylnitrosamine also decreased cytochrome P450 by 54%, arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase activity by 64% but increased the activity of dimethylnitrosamine N-demethylase I by 42%, the cytochrome b5 content by 159% and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity by 57%. It seems from this study that the activity of arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase is dependent on P-450 content but dimethylnitrosamine N-demethylase I is not since the compounds that increased or decreased the activity of arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase had parallel effects on P-450 content. Also, the extent to which the altered activities of dimethylnitrosamine N-demethylase I, P-450, arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase, cytochrome b5 and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase depends on the type of alkyl groups linked to the nitroso group.",

Groups of 50 rats of each sex were administration N-nitrosodiphenylamine at one of two doses, either 1,000 or 4,000 ppm, for 100 wk. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated rats of each sex. All surviving rats were killed at the end of administration of the test chemical. Groups of 50 male mice were administered N-ni trosodiphenylamine at one of two doses, either 10,000 or 20,000 ppm, for 101 weeks. Groups of 50 female mice were administered the test chemical at one of two doses, initially 5,000 or 10,000 ppm, for 38 weeks. Because of excessive depression in the amount of mean body weight gained in the dosed groups, the doses for the females were then reduced to 1,000 and 4,000 ppm, respectively, and administration at the lowered doses was continued for 60 weeks. The time-weighted average doses for the female mice were either 2,315 or 5,741 ppm. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving mice were killed at the end of administration of the test chemical. Mean body weights of dosed rats and mice of each sex were lower than those of corresponding controls, and were dose related throughout the bioassay, except for those of female rats during the first part of the bioassay. Mortality was dose related in the female rats, but was not affected when the test chemical was administered to the male rats or the male or female mice. Survival at the end of the bioassay was 64% or greater in the dosed and control groups of rats and mice of each sex, and sufficient numbers of animals were at risk in all groups for the development of late-appearing tumors. Transitional-cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder occurred at incidences that were dose related (P less than 0.001) in both male and female rats, and in direct comparisons the incidences of these tumors in the high-dose groups of each sex were significantly higher (P less than or equal to 0.001) than those in the corresponding controls (males: controls 0/19, low-dose 0/46, high-dose 16/45; females: controls 0/18, low-dose 0/48, high-dose 40/49). The possible mechanism by which these tumors were induced, such as calculi formation in the bladder or nitrosation of amines present in feed to a carcinogenic nitrosoamine, is unknown. Fibromas of the integumentary system occurred in male rats at incidences that were dose related (P = 0.003), although in direct comparisons the incidences of these tumors in the individual dosed groups were not significantly higher than those in the control group (controls 1/20, or 5%; low-dose 1/50, or 2%; high-dose 10/50, or 20%). The incidence of fibromas of the integumentary system in historical-control male F344 rats at this laboratory is 6/285, or 2%. These results suggest an association of the fibromas in the male rats with the administration of the test chemical. No tumors occurred in the mice of either sex at incidences that were significantly higher in the dosed groups than in the corresponding control groups. The only changes related to compound administration were chronic inflammatory lesions in the urinary bladders of dosed mice. It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, N-nitrosodiphenylamine was carcinogenic for both sexes of F344 rats, inducing transitional-cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder, but was not carcinogenic for B6C3F1 mice of either sex.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates N-nitrosodiphenylamine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase N-nitrosodiphenylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours. Particulate-phase N-nitrosodiphenylamine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. N-Nitrosodiphenylamine absorbs minimal amounts of light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, N-nitrosodiphenylamine is expected to have low mobility based upon a reported Koc of 1200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. N-Nitrosodiphenylamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Degradation of N-nitrosodiphenylamine in soil is expected based on a studies where 68% was degraded by the end of a 30 day incubation at 30 \u00b0C in the dark. In soil amended with wheat straw, N-nitrosodiphenylamine disappeared completely by day 10 of the incubation. If released into water, N-nitrosodiphenylamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Biodegradation was fairly rapid in a static biodegradation test that used domestic wastewater as the inoculum. In a general study, it was determined that nitrosamines are rapidly decomposed by photolysis and do not persist in water illuminated in sunlight. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 43 and 320 days, respectively. A maximum BCF of 217 measured in fish suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to N-nitrosodiphenylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N-nitrosodiphenylamine is produced or used. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 43 and 320 days, respectively(SRC). N-Nitrosodiphenylamine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(5), a maximum BCF of 217, measured in bluegill sunfish(6), suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Biodegradation was fairly rapid in a static biodegradation test that used domestic wastewater as the inoculum(7). N-Nitrosodiphenylamine biodegradation in the original culture and first, second and third subcultures after 7 days incubation per culture was: (10 mg/L initial concentration N-nitrosodiphenylamine) 47, 63, 95, and 98%; at 5 mg/L initial concentration N-nitrosodiphenylamine degradation was 87, 100, 92, and 100%, respectively(7).

Vapor-phase N-nitrosodiphenylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.5X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase N-nitrosodiphenylamine may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). N-Nitrosodiphenylamine absorbs minimal amounts of light at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 16 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). N-Nitrosodiphenylamine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). The maximum adsorption of N-nitrosodiphenylamine, dissolved in methanol, in the UV spectrum was determined to be 262 nm, with limited adsorption reported up to 350 nm(3) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). N-Nitrosodiphenylamine may photo-degrade in water based on structurally similar nitrosoamines that have degradation half-lives of 12-16 hours(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

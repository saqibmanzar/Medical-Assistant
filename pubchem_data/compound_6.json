The chloride group of dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) is susceptible to nucleophilic substitution and is a target for GST-dependent glutathione conjugation in vitro; upon conjugation of the thiol group of glutathione to the DNCB substrate, there is an increase in the absorbance at 340 nm, which permits an indirect quantitation of GST activity in a sample. DNCB induces a type IV hypersensitivity reaction in most patients; therefore, exposure to DNCB can yield an indirect measurement of T-cell activity in a patient and immunocompromised patients may demonstrate decreased hypersensitivity toward DNCB. Following direct application to a wart, DNCB induces an allergic inflammatory response that may cure the viral infection that caused the wart.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

We investigated the effect of the selective TrxR inhibitor 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) on survival and redox status in neuronal cell lines. CDNB was found to cause apoptosis without depletion of glutathione or loss of mitochondrial complex I-activity. Cells treated with CDNB displayed an early increase of reactive oxygen species and rapid activation of stress inducible protein kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4). Thus TrxR inhibition by CDNB results in generation of reactive oxygen species and subsequent activation of stress-inducible kinases without impairment of the cellular antioxidant status or mitochondrial function. Inhibition of the specific kinases involved in cell death triggered by Trx/TrxR dysfunction could represent a novel and selective therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative disorders.",

Differential cytokine secretion patterns are induced rapidly in the skin following first exposure to the contact allergen 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene and the respiratory sensitizer trimellitic anhydride. Trimellitic anhydride induced early expression of IL-10, a cytokine implicated in the negative regulation of Langerhans cell (LC) migration, whereas exposure to 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene resulted in production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta. Associated with this, trimellitic anhydride provoked LC migration with delayed kinetics compared with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, and local neutralization of IL-10 caused enhanced LC mobilization in response to trimellitic anhydride with concomitant up-regulation of cutaneous IL-1beta. ... These differential epidermal cytokine profiles contribute to the polarization of immune responses to chemical allergens via effects on the phenotype of activated dendritic cells arriving in the draining lymph node. Thus, trimellitic anhydride-exposed dendritic cells that have been conditioned in vivo with IL-10 (a potent inhibitor of the type 1-polarizing cytokine IL-12) are effective APCs for the development of a Th2-type response.",

In addition, it has been shown that respiratory allergens, such as trimellitic anhydride, stimulate epidermal Langerhans cell (LC) migration with delayed kinetics compared with contact allergens, such as 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene. Experiments using anti-interleukin (IL)-10 antibodies in vivo suggest that cutaneous IL-10 may contribute to the differential regulation of LC migration by these chemicals. To investigate further the mechanistic basis for the development of polarised immune responses, we have examined the production of epidermal cytokines provoked following a single topical application to BALB/c strain mice of 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene (1%), trimellitic anhydride (25%) or vehicle (acetone:olive oil, 4:1; AOO). Skin explants were excised from mice exposed on the dorsum of both ears for various periods (30min-6hr) to chemical and were cultured on medium prior to analysis of supernatants for the presence of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70 and IL-17 using the Bio-PlexTM cytokine array system. Enhanced production of IL-1beta, a cytokine involved in the initiation of LC migration, was detected only following exposure to 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene, with 15- fold increases induced by 6hr of exposure. In addition, only exposure to 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene was associated with early (2 hr) secretion of IL-17. In contrast, up-regulation of IL- 10, a cytokine that inhibits LC mobilization, was evident only for trimellitic anhydride during the first 3 hr of exposure, with 2 to 3-fold increases in IL-10 release being induced. Small increases in IL-1alpha levels were apparent for both chemicals. No alterations in either IL-6, IL-12p40 or IL-12p70 secretion were recorded and TNF-alpha remained undetectable throughout. These data suggest that discrete epidermal cytokine secretion profiles induced following exposure to chemical contact and respiratory allergens might contribute to the polarization of immune responses, possibly through effects on LC function.",

Refluxing with hydrazine in ethanol yields 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, a reagent used for the characterization of carbonyl compounds. Reaction with ammonium thiocyanate in aqueous medium at 80 \u00b0C gives dinitrophenylrhodanate, which was used as an insecticide. Reaction with substituted anilines gives 2,4-dinitrodiphenylamine derivatives that are used as yellow disperse dyes. Reaction with pyridine gives the reactive (2,4-dinitrophenyl)pyridinium chloride, an intermediate in the preparation of pentamethine dyes.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

It is not clear how sensitization is induced by the generally low concentrations at which they occur but it might be the result of repeated exposure. To compare the strength of contact sensitization induced by a single exposure to 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (60 ug cm(-2)) or three repeated exposures to a subsensitizing dose (10 ug cm(-2)). Two groups (n = 10) of healthy adult volunteers were randomized to receive either a single patch of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene 60 ug cm(-2) or three once-weekly applications to the same site of 10 ug cm(-2) 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene. Four weeks after the last application, sensitization was quantified by measurement of responses (skinfold thickness) to a graded series of four challenge doses. All the volunteers were sensitized and the strength of the responses was virtually identical between the groups. The same degree of sensitization was induced by three exposures to 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene 10 ug cm(-2) as by one exposure to 60 ug cm(-2) of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene. Thus repeated exposure to low doses of contact sensitizers may increase the sensitizing potency.",

Sensitization of BN rats via the skin induced DNCB-specific IgG in serum, but not in all animals, and an increased number of CD4+ cells in the lung parenchyma. Subsequent inhalation challenge with DNCB did not provoke apneas or allergic inflammation (signs of respiratory allergy) in the BN rats. However, microarray analysis of mRNA isolated from the lung revealed upregulation of the genes for Ccl2 (MCP-1), Ccl4 (MIP-1beta), Ccl7 and Ccl17. Skin challenge induced considerably less skin irritation and allergic dermatitis in the BN rat than in the Wistar rat. In conclusion, the Th2-prone BN rat appeared less sensitive to DNCB than the Wistar rat; nevertheless, DNCB induced allergic inflammation in the skin of BN rats but even a relatively high challenge concentration did not induce allergy in the respiratory tract, although genes associated with allergy were upregulated in lung tissue.",

In the present study, repeated inhalation exposures to DNCB were investigated using the same protocol as the single-challenge study: female Wistar rats were dermally sensitized with DNCB and subsequently challenged by inhalation exposure to 7 or 15 mg/cu m3 DNCB twice a week for 4 weeks. Allergy-related apnoeic breathing was not observed. DNCB-specific IgG antibodies were found in the serum and--predominantly lymphocytic--inflammations were found in the nasal tissues and larynx. Similar effects were observed in animals repeatedly exposed by inhalation without previous dermal contact, indicating sensitization by inhalation. The inflammation may be the upper respiratory tract analogue of hypersensitivity pneumonitis/allergic alveolitis. Possible progression of the airway inflammation upon long-term exposure should be investigated to support or dismiss discrimination between contact and respiratory allergens in relation to respiratory allergy.",

In white sturgeon, GST activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) increased significantly (P = 0.005; n = 5) with elevated salinity, but not for the Chinook salmon (P = 0.174; n = 10). ... In conclusion, overall GST activity in white sturgeon, but not Chinook salmon, is stimulated by elevated water salinity, thus electrophilic chemicals such as pesticides may be more effectively detoxified by sturgeon as they undergo seaward migration.",

To knock down the antioxidant defenses of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, animals were pre-treated with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and further challenged with pro-oxidant menadione (MEN). CDNB pre-treatment (10uM for 18 hr) was able to consume cellular thiols in gills, decreasing GSH (53%) and decrease protein thiols (25%). CDNB pre-treatment also disrupted glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase activity in the gills, but likewise strongly induced glutathione S-transferase activity (270% increase). Surprisingly, hemocyte viability was greatly affected 24 hr after CDNB removal, indicating a possible vulnerability of the oyster immune system to electrophilic attack. New in vivo approaches were established, allowing the identification of higher rates of GSH-CDNB conjugate export to the seawater and enabling the measurement of the organic peroxide consumption rate. CDNB-induced impairment in antioxidant defenses decreased the peroxide removal rate from seawater. After showing that CDNB decreased gill antioxidant defenses and increased DNA damage in hemocytes, oysters were further challenged with 1 mM MEN over 24 hr. MEN treatment did not affect thiol homeostasis in gills, while CDNB pre-treated animals recovered GSH and PSH to the control level after 24 hr of depuration. Interestingly, MEN intensified GSH and PSH loss and mortality in CDNB-pre-treated animals, showing a clear synergistic effect. The superoxide-generating one-electron reduction of MEN was predominant in gills and may have contributed to MEN toxicity. These results support the idea that antioxidant-depleted animals are more susceptible to oxidative attack, which can compromise survival. Data also corroborate the idea that gills are an important detoxifying organ, able to dispose of organic peroxides, induce phase II enzymes, and efficiently export GSH-CDNB conjugates.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 8.5X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 750 days. 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene absorbs light greater than 290 nm and is susceptible to direct photolysis in sunlight. Particulate-phase 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene may be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is expected to have low mobility based upon a measured Koc of 501 and an estimated Koc of 575. Strong adsorption to clay surfaces may lower the mobility of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in soils rich in clay content. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur slowly based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.45X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was not biodegraded in the Japanese MITI screening test using an activated sludge inoculum. Biodegradation data on similar dinitrobenzenes suggest that 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene will be biodegraded slowly in water and soil. If released into water, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the measured and estimated Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur slowly based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 21 and 160 days, respectively. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process for 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene since this compound lacks functional groups that undergo hydrolysis under environmental conditions. Photodegradation is expected to occur in surface water; an average photolysis half-life of 32 hours in surface water exposed to sunlight has been reported for this class of compounds. A BCF range of <4.2 to <44 measured in carp suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is produced or used. (SRC)",

Adsorption to clay can decrease mobility(4). Volatilization of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur slowly(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.45X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its vapor pressure of 8.5X10-5 mm Hg(5) and water solubility of 9.24 mg/L(6). 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure. A 0% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(7) suggests that biodegradation is slow in the absence of acclimation(SRC). Biodegradation data on structurally similar dinitrobenzenes(8,9) suggest that 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene will be biodegraded slowly in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.45X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its vapor pressure of 8.5X10-5 mm Hg(5) and water solubility of 9.24 mg/L at 25 \u00b0C(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 21 and 160 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), a BCF range of <4.2 to <44 measured in carp(8) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A 0% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(8) suggests that biodegradation is slow in the absence of acclimation(SRC). Biodegradation data on structurally similar dinitrobenzenes(9,10) suggest that 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene will be biodegraded slowly in water(SRC). Photodegradation is expected to occur in surface water exposed to sunlight(SRC) since 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene absorbs light strongly above 290 nm(11,12); an average photolysis half-life of 32 hours in surface water exposed to sunlight has been reported for this class of compounds(12). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process for 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene since this compound lacks functional groups that undergo hydrolysis under environmental conditions(4).",

In aqueous solution, dinitrobenzenes have quantum yields generally greater than 0.001 at 313 nm(3) indicating that direct photolysis will occur in sunlight(SRC); an average photolysis half-life of 32 hours in surface water exposed to sunlight has been reported for this class of compounds(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Sorption to montmorillonite clay is stronger (Koc of 6000)(2). Using a structure estimation method based on molecular connectivity indices(3), the Koc of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene can be estimated to be 575(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), Koc values of 501-575 suggests that 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is expected to have low mobility in soil. It has been shown that nitrobenzenes adsorb strongly to clay surfaces and the mobility of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is expected to be low in soils rich in clay content(5,6).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Other symptoms include metallic taste, anorexia, difficulty in micturition, mydriasis, agitation, skin rashes and abdominal pain. Exposure can cause increased awareness, lessening of fatigue, exhilaration, sweating, flushing or pallor, dehydration, purposeless motions, bradycardia, extrasystoles, heart block, tachypnea, anxiety, paranoid and hostile behavior, and delirium. Chronic symptoms include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity, personality changes and psychosis. Other chronic symptoms include aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, gynecomastia and angiitis. Exposure to large doses may cause hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assualtiveness, hallucinations, panic states, hyperpyrexia, rhabdomyolysis, fatigue and mental depression following central nervous system stimulation, arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension, circulatory collapse, nausea, vomiting, convulsions, coma and death. Large doses may also cause fever or chilliness, talkativeness, disorientation and aggressive behavior. Other symptoms from large doses include acts of self-destruction and mania."

It includes the likely routes of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, skin and eye contact), and the delayed, immediate, or chronic effects/symptoms from short- and long-term exposure, and the numerical measures of toxicity [e.g., acute toxicity estimates such as the LD50 (median lethal dose, the estimated amount of a chemical expected to kill 50% of test animals in a single dose)].  This section also includes information on whether the chemical is considered as a potential carcinogen according to authoritative sources such as the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens and the International agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

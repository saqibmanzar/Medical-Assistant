For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

In the blood, malaria parasites break down a part of the red blood cells known as haemoglobin. When this happens haemoglobin is divided into two parts; haem and globin. Haem is toxic to the malaria parasite. To prevent it from being damaged, the malaria parasite produces an chemical which converts the toxic haem into a non-toxic product. Primaquine acts by interfering with a part of the parasite (mitochondria) that is responsible for supplying it with energy. Without energy the parasite dies. This stops the infection from continuing and allows the person to recover. Primaquine kills the intrahepatic form of <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> and <i>Plasmodium ovale</i>, and thereby prevents the development of the erythrocytic forms that are responsible for relapses (it also kills gametocytes). Primaquine is not used in the prevention of malaria, only in the treatment. It has insignificant activity against the asexual blood forms of the parasite and therefore it is always used in conjunction with a blood schizonticide and never as a single agent. Primaquine has gametocytocidal activity against all plasmodia, including <i>P. falciparum</i>.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

These agents appear to potentiate the normal redox reactions and are capable of overwhelming the usual protective mechanisms.

Oxidative denaturation of the globin chain decreases its affinity for the heme group, which may dissociate from the globin chain during oxidative injury ... The generation of free radicals may also lead to peroxidation of membrane lipids. This may affect the deformability of the erythrocyte and the permeability of the membrane to potassium. The alteration of the Na(+)/K(+) gradient is ... potentially lethal to the affected erythrocyte. Oxidative injury also impairs the metabolic machinery of the erythrocyte, resulting in a decrease in the concentration of ATP. Damage to the membrane can also permit leakage of denatured hemoglobin from the cell. Such free denatured hemoglobin can be toxic on its own. Free hemoglobin may irreversibly bind nitric oxide, resulting in vasoconstriction. Released hemoglobin may form nephrotoxic hemoglobin dimers, leading to kidney damage. /Oxidative hemolysis/",

HUMAN EXPOSURE: Main risks and target organs: Target organs are: cardiovascular, hematological system, and gastrointestinal. Acute, dose-dependent methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia occurs in persons with a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD); leucopenia or agranulocytosis may also occur.  Adverse effects with therapeutic doses are usually mild. Summary of clinical effects: Toxic manifestations include cardiovascular disturbances, especially ventricular dysrhythmias, abdominal cramps, vomiting, burning epigastric distress, headache, confusion, cyanosis, methemoglobinemia, leucocytosis or leucopenia, and anemia. Granulocytopenia, acute hemolytic anemia and acute hemolysis may occur in individuals who are hypersensitive to primaquine.  Contraindications: The balance of risk and benefit should be considered when primaquine is administered under the following conditions: in acutely ill patients suffering from systemic disease characterized by a tendency to granulocytopenia (for example, patients with arthritis or lupus erythematosus).  Agents capable of depressing the myeloid elements of the bone marrow (antineoplastic agents, colchicine, gold salts, penicillamine, phenylbutazone, quinacrine).  Individuals who have shown previous idiosyncratic reaction to primaquine, individuals with a history of favism or acute haemolytic anaemia.  Individuals with G6PD deficiency or NADH methemoglobin reductase deficiency; primaquine should be discontinued immediately if hemolysis occurs.  Routes of entry: Oral: Oral absorption is the only common cause of intoxication.  Absorption by route of exposure: Primaquine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  The plasma concentration peaks within 1 to 3 hr after ingestion but is negligibly low after 24 hr Considerable inter-individual variation in peak plasma concentrations of primaquine has been reported with the same dose of the drug.  Distribution by route of exposure: Primaquine is extensively distributed into body tissues.  About 75% of primaquine in plasma is bound to proteins and high concentrations occur in erythrocytes.  Primaquine crosses the placenta but it is uncertain whether significant amounts occur in breast milk.  Biological half-life by route of exposure: Primaquine has a plasma elimination half-life of 3.7 to 9.6 hr in healthy adults.  Metabolism: Primaquine is not subject to extensive first pass metabolism.  However, it is readily metabolized in the liver to three metabolites:  8-(3-carboxyl-1-methyl-propylamino)-6-methoxy-quinoline, 5-hydroxy primaquine and 5-hydroxy-6-desmethyl-primaquine.  The carboxyl derivative is the major metabolite found in plasma; it accumulates during repeated administration, when the plasma concentration greatly exceeds that of unchanged primaquine. These metabolites have appreciably less antimalarial activity than primaquine but their haemolytic activity, as assessed by formation of methemoglobin in vitro, is greater than that of the parent compound. Elimination by route of exposure: Only 3.6% of the dose of primaquine is excreted as unchanged drug. The principal metabolite is carboxyprimaquine.  Mode of action: Toxicodynamics: Primaquine may cause hemolysis and methemoglobinemia. Certain ethnic groups, especially those arising in the Mediterranean basin, are more susceptible to these effects and primaquine sensitivity occurs in persons with G6PD deficiency. G6PD deficiency is genetically acquired; there are a large number of variants in which the extent of the deficiency differs.  The sensitivity of individuals to primaquine therefore varies.  G6PD is an enzyme which protects the erythrocyte from the direct oxidative effects of some drugs and chemicals by maintaining intracellular stores of reduced glutathione. In people who are G6PD deficient, oxidation of hemoglobin leads to precipitation within the cell, producing characteristic inclusions called Heinz bodies; increased oxidation of hemoglobin also produces methemoglobinemia. There is an increase in the generation of free radicals which also contribute to cellular damage. These effects ultimately cause hemolysis. Pharmacodynamics: The exact mechanism of anti-malarial activity of primaquine has not been determined, but the drug appears to bind to plasmodial DNA and interfere with its function.  Human data: Adults: The toxicity of primaquine phosphate is dose-dependent; weekly administration (in combination with chloroquine) is less toxic than daily administration. Serious hematologic reactions may occur in some people with a G6PD deficiency even at the low weekly doses of primaquine used in combination with chloroquine for the prophylaxis of malaria.  This occurs primarily in patients with a family or personal history of favism.  Methemoglobinemia is more common in individuals with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide methemoglobin reductase deficiency.  About 10% of the black population with G6PD deficiency develop anaemia due to intravascular hemolysis at daily dose levels of 15 mg (base) and higher. Some darker-skinned Mediterranean populations are more sensitive than blacks.  Teratogenicity: No reports are available to associate primaquine with congenital defects.  Interactions: Primaquine should not be administered concurrently with any other drug that is likely to induce hemolysis or bone marrow depression (see section 4.3) as this may increase the risk of toxicity. Concurrent use of primaquine with bone marrow depressants may increase the risk of leukopenia. If concurrent use is essential, close observation for myelotoxicity should be considered.  The toxicity of primaquine appears to be potentiated by antimalarial agents that are structurally similar (for example, quinacrine). Primaquine should not be administered to patients who have received quinacrine within the previous 3 months.  Although primaquine inhibits the elimination of drugs which undergo oxidative metabolism (for example, antipyrine), therapeutic doses have no effect on paracetamol metabolism.  The combination of chloroquine and primaquine with dapsone may prevent hemolysis in G6PD deficient subjects.  The antimalarial effects of quinacrine and primaquine in various test organisms are synergistic with many antibiotics.  After administration of primaquine, the metabolism of antipyrine (calculated from 0 to 24 h) to its 3 main metabolites, 3 hydroxymethyl-antipyrine, 4 hydroxy-antipyrine and norantipyrine, is significantly reduced.  There is no selective effect on a particular metabolic pathway. Main adverse effects: Gastrointestinal tract: Dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and abdominal cramps. Hematological system: Acute hemolytic anemia occurs most frequently in G6P Ddeficient individuals.  It is usually self-limiting but in severe cases blood transfusion may be necessary.  Methemoglobinemia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia and leucopenia are also reported.  Methemoglobinemia can be severe in people who are nicotinamide dinucleotide (NADH) methemoglobin reductase deficient. Cardiovascular system: Hypertension and arrhythmias have been reported. Other: Headache, interference with visual accommodation and pruritus have been reported with primaquine.  Adverse CNS effects, including depression and confusion, can also occur.  Clinical effects: Acute poisoning: Ingestion: Toxic manifestations such as methemoglobinemia and cyanosis occur in most subjects; adverse gastrointestinal effects occur at higher doses. These doses also cause severe hematologic reactions such as leucopenia, anemia and intravascular hemolysis. Chronic poisoning: Ingestion: The adverse effects associated with chronic administration are similar to those which occur in acute poisoning. Course, prognosis, cause of death: Course: Commonly, symptoms of overdoses are nausea, abdominal pain, sometimes vomiting and jaundice.  Hemolytic anemia may occur in G6PD deficiency but is usually self-limiting. Prognosis: If patient survives for 48 h recovery is likely.  Death: Cardio-circulatory arrest may occur within 1 to 2 h of ingestion due to ventricular dysrhythmia or asystole.  Hypotension is common and may progress rapidly to cardiogenic shock with increased central venous pressure. Hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias have been reported on rare occasions.  Systematic description of clinical effects Cardiovascular: Based on its anti-arrhythmic activity in mice, primaquine is predicted to have quinidine like cardiotoxicity.  Hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias have been reported on rare occasions. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest secondary to circulatory arrest or severe shock may occur within 1 to 2 hr following overdose. Neurological: CNS: In severe cases, headache, mental depression and confusion occur, especially in persons with prior exposure to chloroquine. Gastrointestinal: Abdominal cramps and epigastric distress have been reported. Hepatic: Hepatic function is unaffected. Dermatological: Pruritus and urticaria. Eye, ear, nose, throat: local effects: Diplopia; visual disturbances; blurred vision; irreversible changes to the cornea and retina; optic neuritis. Hematological: Toxic doses of primaquine induce marked bone marrow depression, methemoglobinemia, agranulocytosis and hemolytic anemia.  Hemolytic anemia is commonest in persons with G6PD deficiency.  The effects are more pronounced in the B-type G6PD deficiency (the Mediterranean type) than in the A-type (the type mainly present among black American and African populations) Immunological: Primaquine may also cause immunosuppression Metabolic: Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Hypokalemia is common in severe intoxication.  Others: Hypo- or hyperthermia and hypo- or hyperglycemia have been reported.  Special risks: Pregnancy: Primaquine should be withheld from women with G6PD deficiency who are pregnant. If prophylaxis or treatment is essential, the possible benefits should outweigh the potential risks.      Transplacental transfer of primaquine to a fetus with G6PD deficiency may result in life-threatening anemia and methemoglobinemia in utero. Breast-feeding: It is not known whether primaquine is excreted in breast milk.  However, problems in man have not been documented. Enzyme deficiency: Primaquine should be used with caution in patients with G6PD deficiency who are receiving other drugs likely to induce hemolysis, (for example, nitrites, sulfonamides). /Primaquine phosphate/",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines state that primaquine may be used in breastfeeding mothers and infants with normal G6PD levels.

In the Mediterranean and Asian variants, hemolysis may be much more severe. Therapeutic doses may also cause abdominal pain if administered on an empty stomach. Larger doses can cause nausea and vomiting. Methemoglobinaemia may occur. Other uncommon effects include mild anemia and leukocytosis.

The denatured hemoglobin can form aggregates that bind to the cell membrane to form inclusions called Heinz bodies, a hallmark of oxidative injury to erythrocytes. Heinz bodies can be visualized by use of phase-contrast microscopy or supravital stains such as crystal violet. These membrane-associated inclusions impair the deformability of the erythrocyte membrane and thus impede movement of erythrocytes through the microcirculation and the spleen. Heinz bodies are effectively removed from the erythrocyte by the spleen, so they are not often observed in peripheral blood samples from patients despite ongoing oxidative injury. However, the culling of Heinz bodies can alter the morphology of the affected cells, giving rise to what are called \"bite\" cells and \"blister\" cells ... /which/ look as though a portion of the cytoplasm had been cut away ... /Oxidative hemolysis/",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.9X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates primaquine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase primaquine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.5 hours. Particulate-phase primaquine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Primaquine contains chromophores that may absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight, however the exact rate of this reaction is not known. If released to soil, primaquine is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 5X10+4. The pKa of primaquine is 9.9, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Cations do not volatilize from water or moist soil surfaces. Primaquine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, primaquine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. An estimated BCF of 53 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to primaquine may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where primaquine is produced or used. Exposure to primaquine among the general population may be limited to those administered antimalarial agents containing primaquine as the active ingredient. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

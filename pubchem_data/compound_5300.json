When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, among three isotopes of carbon (i.e., C-12, C-13, and C-14), the isotope atom count considers the C-13 and C-14 atoms, because C-12 is the most abundant isotope of carbon.",

The biochemical mechanism leading to mammalian cell death has not been definitely established; streptozocin inhibits cell proliferation at a considerably lower level than that needed to inhibit precursor incorporation into DNA or to inhibit several of the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis. Although streptozocin inhibits the progression of cells into mitosis, no specific phase of the cell cycle is particularly sensitive to its lethal effects.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Strains not proficient in recombinational repair which lack either RecA protein or RecBC gene products were highly sensitive to streptozotocin (1X10-4 to 1X10-6 M concn for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C). In contrast, cells that constituitively synthesize RecA protein and cannot initiate SOS repair mechanisms because of uncleavable LexA repressor (recAo98 lexA3) were resistant to this drug compared to a lexA3 strain. E coli cells lacking both 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylases I (tag) and II (alkA) also were highly sensitive to streptozotocin. DNA synthesis was most inhibited by streptozotocin in recA and alkA tag E coli mutants, but was suppressed less markedly in wild-type and recBC cells. DNA degradation was most extensive in recA E coli after streptozotocin treatment (400 ul 10-3 M for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C), while comparable in recBC, alkA tag, and wild-type cells. Although incr single-stranded DNA breaks were present after streptozotocin treatment in recA and recBC mutants compared to the wild type, no significant incr in DNA single-stranded breaks was noted in alkA tag E coli. Further, DNA breaks in recBC cells were repaired, while those present in recA cells were not.",

For inducing diabetes, a single iv injection of 60 mg streptozotocin/kg in a physiological saline solution was given at the time indicated below. Manganese was given by ip injection of 15 mg manganese chloride/kg/day in the saline solution for a period indicated in each group. Group 1 was injected with a vehicle for streptozotocin and saline solution for 2 wk (control group). Group 2 was given streptozotocin and treated with saline for 2 wk (streptozotocin group). Group 3 was given the vehicle for streptozotocin and saline for 1 wk, then received manganese for 2 wk (saline-manganese group). Group 4 was injected with streptozotocin and later treated in the same way as in group 3 (streptozotocin-manganese group). Group 5 was administered with managanese for 2 wk, given streptozotocin and followed by 1 wk saline administration (manganese-streptozotocin-saline group). Group 6 was also given manganese for 2 wk and streptozotocin but followed by manganese for 1 wk (manganese-streptozotocin-manganese group). When streptozotocin was given, the blood glucose level rose over 400 mg/dl and stabilized in a few days. The manganese content in the pancreas, spleen, and kidney of streptozotocin-manganese-treated rats were much lower than those in the tissues in group 3, whereas, those in the brain, thymus, and liver remained unchanged. The pancreas, kidney, and brain of group 6 showed more of an incr in manganese content than did those in the manganese-streptozotocin-saline group (group 5). The liver showed a slight incr in manganese content, but the thymus and spleen of group 6 had less manganese contents than did those of group 5.",

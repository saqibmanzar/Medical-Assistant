The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Evidence of liver toxicity was assessed by serum clinical chemistry tests (serum levels of total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, & gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) at least once during the study period for all 127 male workers in the two study departments & for 217 male in plant controls with no previous or current exposure to DMAC. If a worker's biomonitoring results exceeded one of two trigger values established for the study (60 mg N-methylacetamide/g creatinine or 136 mg DMAC equivalent/g creatinine), addnl serum clinical chemistry tests were conducted at weekly intervals for 3 wk. DMAC exposed workers were classified as either high exposure, if 1 or more biomonitoring result exceeded one of the trigger values, or unspecified exposure if none of them did. Control group employees were classified as no exposure. Mean DMAC in air levels for the high & unspecified exposure groups appeared to differ (geometric mean DMAC in air levels of 1.9 & 1.3 ppm 12 hr time weighted avg, respectively). No significant DMAC exposure related trends in hepatic serum clinical chemistry results were detected. Neither transient incr in serum analyte levels after a high biomonitoring result (one that exceeded a trigger value) nor an elevated mean level over the study period when compared with in plant controls were observed. These results /indicate/ that brief threshold limit value level exposures & chronic low level exposure (maximum likelihood estimate of the arithmetic mean for DMAC in air for the high exposure group over the study period was 3.0 ppm 12 hr time weighted avg) do not cause hepatotoxic clinical chemistry responses. /N,N-dimethylacetamide/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.44 mm Hg at 23 \u00b0C indicates N-methylacetamide will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase N-methylacetamide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.1 days. If released to soil, N-methylacetamide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.23X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, N-methylacetamide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. N-Methylacetamide (at 100 ppm), exposed to an activated sludge inoculum for two weeks under aerobic conditions, was categorized as biodegradable. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the slow rate of reaction for amide functional groups. Occupational exposure to N-methylacetamide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N-methylacetamide is produced or used. (SRC)",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.95 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dimethylcarbamoyl chloride will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dimethylcarbamoyl chloride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 24 hours. Vapor-phase dimethylcarbamoyl is also expected to hydrolyze in fog and rain. If released to soil or water, dimethylcarbamoyl chloride is expected to hydrolyze rapidly based on a hydrolysis half-life of 54 sec. Volatilization and adsorption are not expected to be important fate processes for dimethylcarbamoyl chloride in water and moist soil because of its rapid hydrolysis. Dimethylcarbamoyl chloride may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation and bioconcentration should also not be important processes for dimethylcarbamoyl chloride because of its rapid chemical hydrolysis. Occupational exposure to dimethylcarbamoyl chloride may have occurred through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimethylcarbamoyl chloride was produced or used.

Vapor-phase dimethylcarbamoyl chloride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 24 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 16X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) determined using a structure estimation method(3). The hydrolysis half-life for dimethylcarbamoyl chloride is 54 sec(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 12.76X10-3 sec-1(4), which suggests that vapor-phase dimethylcarbamoyl chloride will rapidly hydrolyze in fog and rain(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

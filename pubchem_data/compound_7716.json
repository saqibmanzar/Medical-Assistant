When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.28X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates decylbenzene will exist solely in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase decylbenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 22.4 hrs. If released to soil, decylbenzene is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 2.4X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.0761 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Decylbenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, decylbenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. River die-away tests have shown linear alkyl benzenes are readily biodegradable with half-lives of 7.3 and 11.4 days for C-10 isomers. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.33 and 140 hrs, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. A BCF of 35 for dodecylbenzene measured in fish suggests that bioconcentration of decylbenzene in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to decylbenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where decylbenzene is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to decylbenzene via ingestion of drinking water and use of LAS detergent products containing decylbenzene. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(2) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.0761 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(3). Volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.33 hrs and 140 hrs, respectively(SRC), using an estimation method(3). However, the volatilization half-life does not take into account the effects of adsorption. An estimated Koc of 2.4X10+5 suggests that volatilization could be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediments in water(SRC). This is apparent from the results of two EXAMS model runs, one in which the effect of adsorption was considered, yielding an estimated half-life of 57 months in a model pond 2 m deep, and one in which the effect of adsorption was ignored, yielding an estimated half-life of 65 hrs in a model pond 2 m deep(4). River die-away tests have shown linear alkyl benzenes are readily biodegradable with half-lives of 7.3 and 11.4 days for C-10 isomers(5). A BCF of 35(6) for dodecylbenzene measured in fish suggests that bioconcentration of decylbenzene in aquatic organisms is moderate(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that decylbenzene is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as approximately 4.33 hrs(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as approximately 140 hrs(SRC). However, the volatilization half-life does not take into account the effects of adsorption. An estimated Koc of 2.43X10+5(SRC), from a log Kow of 7.37(4) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests that volatilization could be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediments in water(SRC). This is apparent from the results of two EXAMS model runs, one in which the effect of adsorption was considered, yielding an estimated half-life of 57 months in a model pond 2 m deep, and one in which the effect of adsorption was ignored, yielding an estimated half-life of 65 hrs in a model pond 2 m deep(5). Decylbenzene's estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur, but adsorption may attenuate this process(SRC). Decylbenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.28X10-3 mm Hg(1).",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

(Lamiaceae) (lemon balm) is used in folk medicine for nervous complaints, lower abdominal disorders and, more recently, for treating Herpes simplex lesions. In this work the antiviral activity of a hydroalcoholic extract of lemon balm leaves against the Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) was assessed by the cytopathic effect inhibition assay on Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81), in comparison with acyclovir. The cytotoxicity of the extract on Vero cells was previously tested by evaluating the cellular death and was confirmed by the Trypan blue test. Lemon balm showed to reduce the cytopathic effect of HSV-2 on Vero cells, in the range of non-toxic concentrations of 0.025-1 mg/mL (with reference to the starting crude herbal material). The maximum inhibiting effect (60%) was obtained with 0.5 mg/mL. The viral binding assay showed that the extract does not prevent the entry of HSV-2 in the cells, thus suggesting a mechanism of action subsequent to the penetration of the virus in the cell. The extract was also chemically characterized by NMR and HPLC analysis; it showed to contain cinnamic acid-like compounds, mainly rosmarinic acid (4.1% w/w). /The/ experiments support the use of lemon balm for treating Herpes simplex lesions and encourage clinical trials on this medicinal plant.",

Six healthy men (mean age 37.2 +/- 6.2 y and mean body mass index 22.0 +/- 1.9 kg/sq m) were enrolled in the study that was a crossover design involving single intakes of PE containing 200 mg RA and placebo with a 10 day interval between treatments. Blood samples were collected before intake and at designated time intervals, while urine samples were collected over the periods 0-6 hr, 6-24 hr and 24-48 hr after intake. RA and its related metabolites in plasma and urine were measured by LC-MS. RA, methylated RA (methyl-RA), caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) and a trace of m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in the urine after intake of PE. In plasma, RA, methyl-RA and FA were detected, with maximum levels obtained 0.5, 2 and 0.5 hr after intake of PE, respectively. The majority of these components in both plasma and urine were present as conjugated forms (glucuronide and/or sulfated). The proportion of RA and its related metabolites excreted in the urine was 6.3 +/- 2.2% of the total dose, with approximately 75% of these components being excreted within 6 hr after intake of PE.",

The flux from water or alcoholic solution was 4.4 or 10 ug/sq cm/hr, and the tleg was 7.8 or 3.7 hr, respectively. After I.V. administration, RA is best described by a 2-compartment open model; t1/2 = 1.8 hr, t1/2 alpha = 0.07 hr, V tau = 2.3 L/kg, V beta = 15.3 L/kg. Upon topical administration of RA in form of a W/O ointment (25 mg/kg, 50 sq cm), the absolute bioavailability was 60%. 0.5 hours after iv administration, RA was detected and measured in brain, heart, liver, lung, muscle, spleen and bone tissue, showing the highest concentration in lung tissue (13 times the blood concentration), followed by spleen, heart and liver tissue. 4.5 hours (peak time) after topical administration of about 3 mg on the hind leg over 20 sq cm, RA was measured in blood, skin, muscle and bone tissue.",

The total cumulative amount of 1-7 excreted in the urine 48 h after the oral administration of rosmarinic acid was approximately 31.8% of the dose administered. On the other hand, the metabolites attributed to rosmarinic acid could not be found in the bile. Orally administered rosmarinic acid may thus be concluded to be excreted in the urine rather than in the bile, with cleavage of ester bonds, selective para-dehydroxylation, methylation, and sulfate-conjugation. Metabolites 2, 3, 5, and 6 were also detected in the plasma.",

A cytochrome P450 cDNA was isolated by differential display from cultured cells of Lithospermum erythrorhizon, and the gene product was designated CYP98A6 based on the deduced amino acid sequence. After expression in yeast, the P450 was shown to catalyze the 3-hydroxylation of 4-coumaroyl-4'-hydroxyphenyllactic acid, one of the final two steps leading to rosmarinic acid. The expression level of CYP98A6 is dramatically increased by addition of yeast extract or methyl jasmonate to L. erythrorhizon cells, and its expression pattern reflected the elicitor-induced change in rosmarinic acid production, indicating that CYP98A6 plays an important role in regulation of rosmarinic acid biosynthesis.",

Six healthy men (mean age 37.2 +/- 6.2 y and mean body mass index 22.0 +/- 1.9 kg/sq m) were enrolled in the study that was a crossover design involving single intakes of PE containing 200 mg RA and placebo with a 10 day interval between treatments. Blood samples were collected before intake and at designated time intervals, while urine samples were collected over the periods 0-6 hr, 6-24 hr and 24-48 hr after intake. RA and its related metabolites in plasma and urine were measured by LC-MS. RA, methylated RA (methyl-RA), caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) and a trace of m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in the urine after intake of PE. In plasma, RA, methyl-RA and FA were detected, with maximum levels obtained 0.5, 2 and 0.5 hr after intake of PE, respectively. The majority of these components in both plasma and urine were present as conjugated forms (glucuronide and/or sulfated). The proportion of RA and its related metabolites excreted in the urine was 6.3 +/- 2.2% of the total dose, with approximately 75% of these components being excreted within 6 hr after intake of PE.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

To determine the effects of rosmarinic acid on melanogenesis and elucidate the molecular events of melanogenesis induced by rosmarinic acid, several experiments were performed in B16 melanoma cells. In this study, ... the melanin content and tyrosinase expression were increased by rosmarinic acid in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, after the melanin content was increased by rosmarinic acid, it was reduced by H-89 and KT 5720, protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors, but not by SB203580, a p38mapk inhibitor, or Ro-32-0432, a PKC inhibitor, which suggests the involvement of PKA in rosmarinic acid-induced melanogenesis. Consistent with this, rosmarinic acid induced the phosphorylation of CRE-binding protein (CREB), but had no effect on the phosphorylation of p38mapk or the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. Additionally, rosmarinic acid induced the activation of cAMP response element (CRE) without having any effect on cAMP production, which suggests that rosmarinic acid-induced melanogenesis is mediated by PKA, which occurs downstream of cAMP production. This result was further confirmed by the fact that rosmarinic acid-induced phosphorylation of CREB was inhibited by H-89, but not by PD98059, a MEK1 inhibitor, or by LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. Rosmarinic acid-induced expression of tyrosinase protein was attenuated by H-89. Based on these results, ...  rosmarinic acid induces melanogenesis through PKA activation signaling.",

Rosmarinic acid has been reported to have effects on both the classical pathway C3-convertase and on the cobra venom factor-induced, alternative pathway convertase. In order to define the mechanism of inhibition, the effect of RA on classical and alternative pathway lysis, C1q binding, the classical pathway convertase, the alternative pathway convertase, membrane attack pathway lysis and the generation of fragments of C3 and C5 during activation, was tested in vitro. The results showed that RA inhibited lysis by the classical pathway more than by the alternative pathway. This effect was dose-dependent with maximum inhibition of classical pathway lysis observed at 2.6 mmoles of RA. There was little effect on C1q binding or on the classical and alternative pathway convertases. However, there was highly significant inhibition of lysis of pre-formed EA43b cells by dilutions of human or rabbit serum in the presence of RA (1 mM); this was accompanied by inhibition of C5a generation. /It was concluded/ that the inhibitory effect of RA involves the C5 convertase. Such inhibition could be advantageous to the host in disorders where the terminal attack sequence plays a role in pathogenesis.",

However, the precise mechanisms of RA have not been well elucidated in TNF-alpha-mediated anti-cancer therapy. In this study, /the authors/ found that RA treatment significantly sensitizes TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in human leukemia U937 cells through the suppression of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activation of caspases in response to TNF-alpha was markedly increased by RA treatment. However, pretreatment with the caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD-fmk, was capable of significantly restoring cell viability in response to combined treatment. RA also suppressed NF-kappaB activation through inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha, and nuclear translocation of p50 and p65. This inhibition was correlated with suppression of NF-kappaB-dependent anti-apoptotic proteins (IAP-1, IAP-2, and XIAP). RA treatment also normalized TNF-alpha-induced ROS generation. Additionally, ectopic Bcl-2 expressing U937 reversed combined treatment-induced cell death, cytochrome c release into cytosol, and collapse of mitochondrial potential. These results demonstrated that RA inhibits TNF-alpha-induced ROS generation and NF-kappaB activation, and enhances TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis.",

Previously... RosA inhibited T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)- induced interleukin 2 (IL-2) expression and subsequent T-cell proliferation in vitro. /This study/ investigated /the/ inhibitory mechanism of RosA on TCR signaling, which ultimately activates IL-2 promoter by activating transcription factors, such as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and activating protein-1 (AP-1). Interestingly, RosA inhibited NF-AT activation but not AP-1, suggesting that RosA inhibits Ca+2-dependent signaling pathways only. Signaling events upstream of NF-AT activation, such as the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and Ca+2 mobilization, and tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1) were strongly inhibited by RosA. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 is largely dependent on 3 kinds of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), ie, Lck, ZAP-70, and Itk. /Investigators/ found that RosA efficiently inhibited TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Itk but did not inhibit Lck or ZAP-70. ZAP-70-dependent signaling pathways such as the tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76 and serine/threonine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were intact in the presence of RosA, confirming that RosA suppresses TCR signaling in a ZAP-70-independent manner. .../It is concluded/ that RosA inhibits TCR signaling leading to Ca+2 mobilization and NF-AT activation by blocking membrane-proximal events, specifically, the tyrosine phosphorylation of inducible T cells kinase (Itk) and PLC-gamma 1.",

It is used for flavoring food, a beverage drink, as well as in cosmetics; in folk medicine it is used as an antispasmodic in renal colic and dysmenorrhoea, in relieving respiratory disorders and to stimulate growth of hair. Extract of rosemary relaxes smooth muscles of trachea and intestine, and has choleretic, hepatoprotective and antitumerogenic activity. The most important constituents of rosemary are caffeic acid and its derivatives such as rosmarinic acid. These compounds have antioxidant effects. ...",

The phenolic compound, rosmarinic acid, obtains one of its phenolic rings from phenylalanine via caffeic acid and the other from tyrosine via dihydroxyphenyl-lactic acid. Relatively large-scale production of rosmarinic acid can be obtained from the cell culture of Coleus blumei Benth when supplied exogenously with phenylalanine and tyrosine. Rosmarinic acid is well absorbed from gastrointestinal tract and from the skin. It increases the production of prostaglandin E2 and reduces the production of leukotriene B4 in human polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and inhibits the complement system. It is concluded that rosemary and its constituents especially caffeic acid derivatives such as rosmarinic acid have a therapeutic potential in treatment or prevention of bronchial asthma, spasmogenic disorders, peptic ulcer, inflammatory diseases, hepatotoxicity, atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, cataract, cancer and poor sperm motility.",

It was established that 12 hr after treatment with 25 mg/L vanadyl sulfate the rosmarinic acid production was increased up to 3.92 g/L (2.8 times higher compared to the control cultivation). No significant amounts of rosmarinic acid were detected in the culture medium in comparison with its intracellular content. However, it was observed that the extracellular content of rosmarinic acid is 3.3 times higher compared to the control variant (4 hr after treatment at elicitor concentration 25 mg/L).",

Identification and quantitation of the constituents responsible for their antiinflammatory activity is challenging owing to the lack of suitable chromatographic methodology. In the present research, the simultaneous quantitation of antiinflammatory constituents rosmarinic acid, oleanolic acid, and ursolic acid in mints was attained by using a unique tandem HPLC column system coupled with an electrospray ionization mass detection (MRM mode). The ion mode optimization for rosmarinic acid under negative and triterpenoid acids under positive was achieved by setting 2 time segments in a single run where the polarity mode was switched from negative (0 to 10 min) to positive (10 to 40 min). For the investigated concentration ranges of anti-inflammatory agents in mints, good linearities (r2 > or = 0.998) were obtained for each calibration curve. Validation of precision and accuracy for this method showed that intra- and inter-day repeatabilities for all analytes were less than 5.51%, and the recoveries varied from 97.8% to 99.3%. The developed LC/MS/MS assay provides a suitable quality control method for the determination of antiinflammatory constituents in Mentha spp. There is a wide range of diversity in the natural product composition for these acids across the Mentha germplasm collection evaluated. The presence of these antiinflammatory acids in post-distilled mints shows that value-added nutraceutical enriched products can be developed with proper processing and recovery systems in addition to the distillation and capture of the valuable volatile essential oils...",

Limitations and possibilities of using the various methodologies to obtain information about the reaction chemistry of polyphenols are discussed. Three different spectra were detected dependent on the pH and oxidizing agent. Feasible structures for the observed radicals were tested by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the results indicate that oxidation reactions can occur at both of the catechol groups.",

This modified biopolymer matrix (Au-BMI-PF(6)-CTN) was used as a support for the immobilization of the enzyme peroxidase (PER) from pea (Pisum sativum), and employed to develop a new biosensor for rosmarinic acid (RA) determination in pharmaceutical samples by square-wave voltammetry. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the PER catalyzes the oxidation of RA to the corresponding o-quinone, which is electrochemically reduced at a potential of +0.14 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Under optimized conditions, the resulting peak current increased linearly for the RA concentration range of 0.50 to 23.70 uM with a detection limit of 70.09 nM. The biosensor demonstrated high sensitivity, good repeatability and reproducibility, and long-term stability (15% decrease in response over 120 days). The method was successfully applied to the determination of RA content in pharmaceutical samples, with recovery values being in the range of 98.3 to 106.2%. The efficient analytical performance of the proposed biosensor can be attributed to the effective immobilization of the PER enzyme in the modified CTN matrix, the significant contribution of the high conductivity of the ionic liquid, the facilitation of electron transfer promoted by gold nanoparticles, and the inherent catalytic ability of these materials.",

This study investigated whether RA supplementation prevents cardiac abnormalities and hypertension in fructose-fed rats (FFR). Rats fed with fructose diet (60 g/100 g) for 60 days exhibited metabolic abnormalities and rise in plasma and cardiac lipids and whole body IR. The levels of cardiac antioxidants and plasma ferric reducing antioxidant power were significantly reduced in FFR concomitant with increased levels of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation products. A significant rise in troponin T, creatine kinase-MB, aspartate transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase in plasma of FFR was noted. RA supplementation to FFR (10 mg/kg from the 16th day) significantly improved insulin sensitivity, reduced lipid levels, oxidative damage, and the expression of p22phox subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced oxidase, and prevented cardiac hypertrophy. Fructose-induced rise in blood pressure was also lowered by RA through decrease in endothelin-1 and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and increase in nitric oxide levels. Histology revealed a reduction in myocardial damage in RA-supplemented FFR. These findings suggest that RA acts as a vasoactive substance and a cardioprotector through its antioxidant property. Thus, RA may be useful in reducing the cardiovascular risk associated with IR.",

DEP has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species. Intratracheal instillation of DEP induces lung inflammation and edema in mice. Rosmarinic acid is a naturally occurring polyphenol with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. /This/ investigated the effects of rosmarinic acid on lung injury induced by intratracheal administration of DEP (500 ug/body) in mice. Oral supplementation with administration of rosmarinic acid (2 mg/body for 3 d) inhibited DEP-induced lung injury, which was characterized by neutrophil sequestration and interstitial edema. DEP enhanced the lung expression of keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), interleukin-1beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, which was inhibited by treatment with rosmarinic acid. DEP enhanced expression of iNOS mRNA and formation of nitrotyrosine and 8-OHdG in the lung, which was also inhibited by rosmarinic acid. These results suggest that rosmarinic acid inhibits DEP-induced lung injury by the reduction of proinflammatory molecule expression. Antioxidative activities of rosmarinic acid may also contribute to its protective effects.",

The antigenotoxic capacity of rosmarinic acid (100 mg/kg) was tested using pre-, co- and post-treatment with ethanol (5 g/kg). Peripheral blood (1 and 24 hr) and brain cells (24 hr) were evaluated using the comet assay and bone marrow was analyzed using the micronucleus assay (24 hr). The results were compared to data of TBARS, enzymes with antioxidant activity, and DCFH-DA test. Peripheral blood and brain cells show that mean damage index (DI) and damage frequency (DF) values of ethanol with pre-treatment with rosmarinic acid group were significantly lower than in the ethanol group. In brain cells all different treatments with ethanol and rosmarinic acid showed significant decrease in DI and DF mean values when compared to ethanol group and negative control. No significant differences were observed in micronucleus frequency, activity of antioxidant enzymes and TBARS between groups. The DCFH-DA test show a reduction of 18% of fluorescence intensity when compare with ethanol group. The results show that rosmarinic acid could decrease the levels of DNA damage induced by ethanol, for both tissues and treatment periods.",

This study was performed to evaluate the effect of rosmarinic acid on atopic dermatitis (AD), one of the inflammatory disorders of the skin. Twenty-one subjects (14 women and seven men, 5-28 years of age) with mild AD participated in this study. Rosmarinic acid (0.3%) emulsion was topically applied to the elbow flexures of AD patients twice a day (once in the morning and once in the evening). All subjects were evaluated for skin conditions before treatment at the first visit, and then at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. According to local Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index results, erythema on antecubital fossa was significantly reduced at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). Transepidermal water loss of the antecubital fossa was significantly reduced at 8 weeks compared to before treatment (P < 0.05). ...",

One approach to protecting human skin against the harmful effects of UV radiation is by using herbal compounds as photoprotectants. This study evaluated the protective effects of Prunella vulgaris L. (Labiatae) and its main phenolic acid component, rosmarinic acid (RA), against UVA-induced changes in a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). Human keratinocytes exposed to UVA (10-30 J/sq cm) were treated with an extract of P. vulgaris (1-75 mg/L) or RA (0.9-18 mg/L) for 4 hr. P. vulgaris and RA exhibited ability to reduce the UVA-caused decrease in a cell viability monitored by neutral red retention and by LDH release into medium. The P. vulgaris extract and RA significantly suppressed UVA-induced ROS production, which manifests as a decrease in intracellular lipid peroxidation, elevation of ATP and reduced glutathione. Post-treatment with P. vulgaris extract and RA also significantly reduced DNA damage. In addition, UVA-induced activation of caspase-3 was inhibited by treatment with P. vulgaris and RA. The P. vulgaris extract and RA demonstrated a concentration-dependent photoprotection (maximum at 25-50 mg/L and 9 mg/L, respectively). These results suggest that P. vulgaris and RA, used in skin care cosmetics, may offer protection against UVA-induced oxidative stress and may be beneficial as a supplement in photoprotective dermatological preparations.",

RA at 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg was administered by gavage once daily for 2 consecutive days, 6 hr after carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) intoxication. CCl(4) intoxication caused hepatic necrosis and increased serum ALT activity. In the livers, oxidative/nitrosative stress was evidenced by increased 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation and a significant decrease in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. CCl(4) administration triggered inflammatory response in mice livers by activating nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which coincided with the induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). RA improved histological and serum markers of liver damage and significantly ameliorated oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammatory response in liver tissue. Additionally, RA prevented transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression, suggesting suppression of profibrotic response. Furthermore, RA significantly inhibited the CCl4-induced apoptosis, which was evident from decreased cleavage of caspase-3. The hepatoprotective activity of RA coincided with enhanced NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. The results of this study indicates that RA possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and antifibrotic activity against acute liver toxicity.",

Perilla decoction significantly suppressed PCA-reaction, and the inhibition % at the dose of 500 mg/kg was 43%. The perilla decoction contains 5.3% of luteolin 7-O-[beta-glucuronosyl(2--)1)beta-glucuronide], 1.6% of apigenin 7-O-[beta-glucuronosyl(2--)1)beta-glucuronide], 0.49% of scutellarin, and 2.5% of rosmarinic acid (weight of compound/dried weight of perilla decoction %), respectively. When these constituents were orally administered to mice at the dose equivalent to 500 mg/kg of perilla decoction, rosmarinic acid and apigenin 7-O-[beta-glucuronosyl(2--)1)beta-glucuronide] significantly suppressed PCA-reaction, and their inhibition % was 41% (p < 0.01) and 32% (p < 0.05), respectively. Since the inhibition % or perilla decoction and rosmarinic acid were nearly equal, the anti-allergic effect of perilla decoction depends primarily on rosmarinic acid. The standard Saiboku-to decoction contained 0.013% of rosmarinic acid, which was too low to exhibit anti-allergic activity in a daily dose of Saiboku-to in adults ...",

Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in to four equal groups as follows: group 1 (control), group 2 (GS 100 mg/kg/day ip), group 3 (GS 100 mg/kg/day ip + RA 50 mg/kg/day) and group 4 (GS 100 mg/kg/d ip + RA 100 mg/kg/day). Treatments were administrated once daily for 12 days. After 12 days 24 hr urine was collected, blood was sampled and kidneys were removed. Serum and kidney tissue MDA assessed by thiobarbituric acid. Kidney paraffin sections (5 um thickness) from the left kidney stained with periodic acid Schiff. Tubular necrosis was studied semiquantitatively and glomerular volume and volume density of proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) estimated stereologically. Kidney homogenize were prepared from right kidney. Serum creatinine, urea and kidney antioxidant enzymes activity were assessed by special kits. Data were compared by SPSS 13 software and Mann-Whitney test at P < 0.05. Co treatment of GS and RA (High dose) significantly decreased serum creatinine, MDA, urea, tubular necrosis (P < 0.05) and increase renal GSH, GPX, CAT, SOD, volume density of PCT and creatinine clearance significantly in comparison with GS group (P < 0.05). Treatment with RA (high dose) maintained serum creatinine, volume density of PCT, renal GSH, GPX, SOD and MDA as the same level as control group significantly (P < 0.05)...",

Rosmarinic acid was orally administered to the rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day from the day of ATS injection (day 0) to day 8 when rats were sacrificed. The degree of mesangial cell proliferation and matrix accumulation were evaluated by trichrome staining and by immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), fibronectin, type IV collagen and fibrin. Superoxide dismutase (SOD)-activity in the homogenate of renal cortex was also evaluated. The number of PCNA-positive cells, staining areas of trichrome, fibronectin, collagen IV and fibrin in the glomerulus were significantly decreased, and SOD-activity of renal cortex homogenate was significantly augmented in rosmarinic acid-treated group. /It was concluded that/ rosmarinic acid would suppress the proliferation of mesangial cells and glomerular matrix expansion in vivo by its fibrinolytic and anti-oxidative activity.",

Rosmarinic acid occurs in many common herbal plants of the Lamiaceae group including rosemary, sage, spanish sage, oregano, basil, marjoram, thyme, the mint group, lavender, perilla and lemon balm. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.1X10-13 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates rosmarinic acid will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase rosmarinic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, rosmarinic acid is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 60. The pKa of rosmarinic acid is 3.57, indicating that this compound will exist partially in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-27 atm-cu m/mole. Rosmarinic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Rosmarinic acid has a UV absorption maximum at 332 nm: therefore, it may be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, rosmarinic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Rosmarinic acid is expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment with half-lives of 26 and 2.6 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Sensitized photo-oxidation may be an important fate process for rosmarinic acid in natural waters exposed to sunlight. Occupational exposure to rosmarinic acid may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where rosmarinic acid is produced or used. The general population is exposed to rosmarinic acid via ingestion of dietary supplements and foods (herbs) containing rosmarinic acid and dermal contact with this compound in consumer products containing rosmarinic acid.

The estimated pKa of rosmarinic acid is 3.57(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Volatilization of rosmarinic acid from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-27 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Rosmarinic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 1.1X10-13 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) determined from a fragment constant method(2). Rosmarinic acid has a UV absorption maximum at 332 nm(5); therefore, it may be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-27 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Phenols can undergo sensitized photo-oxidation in surface waters exposed to sunlight via reaction with hydroxyl and RO2 radicals with half-lives on the order of days to weeks at the water surface(4); therefore, photo-oxidation may be an important fate process for rosmarinic acid in natural water(SRC). Rosmarinic acid is expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment with half-lives of 26 and 2.6 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 1.82(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2012).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to the atmosphere, 2-ethylphenol will mainly exist in the vapor phase based on a measured vapor pressure of 0.153 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 2-ethylphenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 9 hours. An estimated Koc of 530 suggests that 2-ethylphenol will have moderate to low mobility in soil. Volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces is possible, but should not be a major fate process for this compound based on values for vapor pressure and Henry's Law constant, respectively. Limited data suggests that this compound may biodegrade in both soil and water under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In water, 2-ethylphenol may adsorb to suspended matter in the water column based on its Koc value. 2-Ethylphenol may volatilize from water surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9 and 68 days, respectively. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate, not high based on an estimated BCF value of 44. Exposure to 2-ethylphenol may occur occupationally during its production or use in the manufacture of other products. The general population may be exposed via dermal contact or the inhalation of air containing this compound. (SRC)",

Limited data suggests that biodegradation of this compound under both aerobic(4) and anaerobic conditions(5) may be possible. 2-Ethylphenol's values for vapor pressure(6) and Henry's Law constant(6,7,SRC) indicate that volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces is possible, but is not likely to be a major fate process for this compound(SRC).",

Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9 and 68 days, respectively(3,SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This value indicates that 2-ethylphenol will volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 9 days(3,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 68 days(3,SRC). 2-Ethylphenol's values for vapor pressure(1) and estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2,SRC) indicate that volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces is possible, but is not likely to be a major fate process for this compound(SRC).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The latency to onset was approximately 2 weeks and the pattern of injury was mixed. There were no immunoallergic or autoimmune features and recovery was prompt once the medication was stopped. Since that report, there has only been a single mention of possible hepatotoxicity due to trimethobenzamide, a somewhat prolonged case of hepatocellular injury with a cholestatic pattern on liver biopsy despite minimal jaundice. Thus, clinically apparent liver injury from trimethobenzamide must be very rare and is generally mild and self-limited in course.",

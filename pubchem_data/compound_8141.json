When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Pigs were exposed to JP-8 soaked cotton fabrics for 1 and 4 days with repeated daily exposures.  Pre-treated and untreated skin was then dermatomed and placed in in-vitro diffusion cells.  Five cells with exposed skin and four cells with unexposed skin were dosed with a mixture of 14 different HC consisting of nonane, decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, ethyl benzene, o-xylene, trimethyl benzene (TMB), cyclohexyl benzene (CHB), naphthalene, and dimethyl naphthalene (DMN) in water + ethanol (50:50) as diluent.  Another five cells containing JP-8 exposed skin were dosed with diluent only in order to determine the residue potential of jet fuel HC in skin.  The data indicated that there was 2-3-fold and 3-4-fold increase in absorption of nonane, undecane, dodecane and tridecane through 1 and 4 days JP-8 pre-exposed skin respectively... The absorption parameters of flux, diffusivity and permeability were calculated for the studied HC. The possible mechanism of increased HC absorption in fuel pre-exposed skin may be via lipid extraction from stratum corneum as indicated by electron microscopy.  This study suggests that single dose application data for jet fuel HC cannot be used to predict the toxic potential for repeated exposures and that for certain compounds, persistent absorption may occur days post-exposure.",

The aim of this study was to determine in vitro metabolic rate constants for semivolatile n-alkanes, nonane (C9), decane (C10), and tetradecane (C14), by rat liver microsomal oxidation. The metabolism was assessed by measuring the disappearance of parent compound by gas chromatography.  Various concentrations of n-alkanes were incubated with liver microsomes from adult male F-344 rats.  Nonlinear kinetic constants for nonane and decane were V(max) (nmol/mg protein/min) = 7.26 +/- 0.20 and 2.80 +/- 0.35, respectively, and K(M) (uM) = 294.83 +/- 68.67 and 398.70 +/- 42.70, respectively. Metabolic capacity as assessed by intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(M)) was approximately four-fold higher for nonane (0.03 +/- 0.005) than for decane (0.007 +/- 0.001)... These results show a negative correlation between metabolic clearance and chain length of n-alkanes.  These metabolic rate constants will be used to update existing physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for nonane and decane as part of developing a PBPK model for JP-8.",

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 1A2, 2B6 and 2E1 metabolize nonane to 2-nonanol, whereas alcohol dehydrogenase, CYPs 2B6 and 2E1 metabolize 2-nonanol to 2-nonanone.  Nonane and 2-nonanol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of testosterone, estradiol or N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), but did inhibit carbaryl metabolism. JP-8 showed modest inhibition of testosterone, estradiol and carbaryl metabolism, but had a more significant effect on the metabolism of DEET.  JP-8 was shown to inhibit CYPs 1A2 and 2B6 mediated metabolism of DEET, suggesting that at least some of the components of JP-8 might be metabolized by CYPs 1A2and/or 2B6.",

However, metabolic interactions between these three substrates have not been described.  In this study the effect of either coincubation or preincubation of CPS with HLM or CYP isoforms with either fipronil or nonane as substrate was investigated.  In both co- and preincubation experiments, CPS significantly inhibited the metabolism of fipronil or nonane by HLM although CPS inhibited the metabolism of fipronil more effectively than that of nonane.  CPS significantly inhibited the metabolism of fipronil by CYP3A4 as well as the metabolism of nonane by CYP2B6.  In both cases, preincubation with CPS caused greater inhibition than coincubation, suggesting that the inhibition is mechanism based.",

Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. For petroleum crude oil, do not spray water directly into a breached tank car. This can lead to a dangerous boil over. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks in direct contact with flames. For massive fire, use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2024)",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Dermal exposures were carried out by occlusive application of chemicals ... for 1 hr. The expression of IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha and MCP-1 was measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and the regulatory proteins NFkappaB and IkappaBalpha were measured by Western blot analysis. The skin irritation and TEWL data indicate that the irritation was in the following decreasing order: nonane > dodecane > tetradecane. Likewise, nonane significantly increased the expression of IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha and MCP-1 in skin and blood as compared to control at different time points. Dodecane and tetradecane did not show any increase in the expression of IL-1 alpha and MCP-1 as compared to control (P>0.05), but the expression of TNF-alpha by dodecane and tetradecane was significantly higher than control at all time points. The release of cytokines by nonane exposure was further supported by activation of NFkappaB p65 and corresponding degradation of IkappaBalpha in the skin. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the biophysical parameters (TEWL and erythema scores) were correlated to the biomarker expressions after dermal exposures with nonane but not with dodecane and tetradecane. ...",

Cytochrome P-450 and free sulfhydryl contents of liver were also decreased significantly after 7 days treatment on n-octane and n-nonane. A 2- and 3- fold increase in liver lipid peroxidation estimated as TBA reactants was observed in the animals treated for 2 or 7 days with n-octane or n-nonane.",

Female albino-rats received 1.0 mL/kg n-octane or n-nonane intraperitoneally for 2 or 7 days. Rats were killed at intervals after a 20 hour fast. Blood samples were collected and serum was separated. Liver was removed, washed, and homogenized. Acetylcholinesterase, carboxylesterase, fructose-diphosphate-aldolase, and 5'-nucleotidase activities, serum total protein and albumin, total lipids, total and free cholesterol, and nucleic-acids were determined. Serum acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase activities decreased significantly and fructose-diphosphate-aldolase activity increased significantly when compared to controls. After 7 days of exposure to n-octane and n-nonane, 5'-nucleotidase activity significantly increased in the liver. Serum total protein significantly decreased by 34% and 38% for n-octane and n-nonane, respectively, when compared to controls. Albumin and serum esterified cholesterol significantly decreased by 41% and 60%, respectively, for n-octane and n-nonane when compared to controls. Total cholesterol significantly decreased by 42 and 46% for n-octane and n-nonane, respectively. In liver, esterified cholesterol significantly decreased, free cholesterol significantly increased, and nucleic acid contents were unchanged.",

The presence of n-nonane in gasoline and petroleum based products may result in its release through the use of these substances as well. n-Nonane is a constituent in the paraffin fraction of crude oil and natural gas. n-Nonane was identified as a volatile constituent in kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) flowers, in the essential oil of Common St Johnswort (Hyericum perfortum), ginger (Zingiber officale), and in the fruit of black pepper (Piper nigrum). The compound has been identified in the volatile fraction of Korean chamchwi (Aster scber Thunb). If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.45 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-nonane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-nonane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.7 days. n-Nonane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, n-nonane is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8.0X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4 atm-cu m/mole. n-Nonane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. n-Nonane is expected to biodegrade in soil based on 100% degradation after 5 and 25 days in screening tests using seawater sediment and activated sewage sludge inocula, respectively. If released into water, n-nonane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Based on 100% degradation within 25 days during aerobic biodegradation screening tests, n-nonane is expected to biodegrade in natural water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.3 hours and 4.5 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 155 days if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 12,000 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups. Occupational exposure to n-nonane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-nonane is produced or used. The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to n-nonane is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from gasoline and other petroleum products. Monitoring data also indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-nonane via ingestion of food and drinking water, although these pathways are considered minor when compared with inhalation.

Volatilization of n-nonane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 4.45 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 22 mg/L)(5). n-Nonane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). Evaporation was considered to be the primary removal mechanism during a study where n-nonane was completely removed from both sterile and non-sterile soils after 5 days(6). Under conditions where volatilization is hindered, biodegradation of n-nonane is expected to be an important fate process based on 100% degradation after 5 and 25 days in screening tests using seawater sediment and activated sewage sludge inocula, respectively(7,8), suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 4.45 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 22 mg/L)(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.3 hours and 4.5 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 155 days if adsorption is considered(7). According to a classification scheme(8), an estimated BCF of 100(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Based on 100% degradation after 5 days in water inoculated with seawater sediment(9) and 100% degradation after 25 days in water inoculated with activated sewage sludge(10), biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process for n-nonane in water(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Complete recovery was reported for all the control samples(1). n-Nonane was completely degraded after a 25 day incubation period in gasoline (400 mg/L) inoculated with activated aerobic sewage sludge (100 mg dry wt/L)(2). The initial concentration of n-nonane was not provided. The concentration of n-nonane in an abiotic flask 25 days after gasoline was added was 0.41 mg/L(2). n-Nonane degradation was observed in active and sterile sandy loam treated with JP-4 jet fuel (10 uL per gram of soil)(3). The concentration of n-nonane at 0 time was 0.118 ug/mL in the active soil and 0.110 ug/mL in the sterile soil while the concentrations in both soils were 0 ug/mL when they were tested a second time after 5 days(3). Evaporation was considered to be the primary removal process(3). Biodiesel B20 (20% soybean fatty acid methyl esters and 80% petroleum diesel) exhibited a half-life of <30 days using an acclimated aquatic inocula from a rainwater detention pond; a half-life of 2.1 days was calculated for n-nonane, a component of this fuel(4). n-Nonane, present at 1.2 ug as a component in gasoline, was incubated in a New Jersey rainwater retention pond.

The terminal methyl group is enzymatically oxidized by incorporation of a molecular oxygen by a monooxygenase producing a primary alcohol with further oxidation to an acid group, although involvement of a dioxygenase is also postulated. Once the fatty acid is produced, it is degraded into 2-carbon units via the beta-oxidation pathway. ... Another pathway for n-alkane degradation that is encountered less often is the oxidation of both terminal carbons to form a dioic acid with subsequent beta-oxidation. Subterminal oxidation of the 2-carbon atom is seen mainly in C3-C6 alkanes, although it does occur in longer chain alkanes also. ... A dehydrogenation of the n-alkane may also occur yielding an alkene which is then converted to an alcohol, although there is little evidence for this theory. Some microorganisms have been shown to have both terminal and subterminal oxidation, each having different rates of activity. The different chain lengths of n-alkanes are degraded to different extents ... . At chain lengths greater than C6 the degradability generally increases until about C11-C12. ... /n-Alkanes/",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that n-nonane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 3.3 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 4.5 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 155 days if adsorption is considered(4). n-Nonane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of n-nonane from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon the vapor pressure(1).",

The actual concentrations were not specified(4). n-Nonane has been detected in waste disposal site landfill gas in the UK; however, concentrations were not provided(5). A clay pit landfill in England that received municipal, industrial and liquid wastes emitted n-nonane gas at a concentration of 116 mg/L(4). The percentage of n-nonane in the emissions of volatile organic compounds in the UK during 1990 has been reported as 1.1%(6). The concentrations of n-nonane in the biogas released from a waste disposal site in Augsburg, Germany, a waste disposal site in Munich, Germany, and two sewage treatment plants in Munich, Germany were 14.9-18.3, 15.8-17.8, 0.8-1.3 mg/cu m, respectively(7). The concentration of n-nonane in the emissions of a municipal waste incineration plant located in Germany was 0.57 ug/cu m(8).

The average exhaust from 67 gasoline fueled vehicles was found to contain n-nonane at a concentration 0.2% by weight(2). The concentrations of n-nonane measured in the tailpipe emissions of catalyst-equipped and noncatalyst-equipped gasoline-powered motor vehicles were 430 and 45,300 ug/km, respectively(3). The concentration of n-nonane measured in the emissions of diesel-powered medium duty trucks was reported to be 160 ug/km(4). The mean concentration of n-nonane in six car exhaust samples collected in the UK was 262 ppbV(5). n-Nonane concentrations measured in the emissions of diesel engines and petrol vehicles have been reported as 17 and 520 ug/cu m, respectively(6). The concentrations of n-nonane in samples of exhaust air from the Elbtunnel in Hamburg, Germany ranged from 2.04-2.44 ug/cu m(7). Motorboats emitted n-nonane to canal water with resultant concentration ranging from 1 to 14 ng/L with an average of 6 ng/L in 8 samples(8). The average mass emission rate of n-nonane from ten four-stroke lawnmower engines was 0.50-0.58% of total organic gases(9).",

The average concentrations of n-nonane in samples collected during two flights through a summertime plume above London were 111 and 53 parts per trillionV(1). The average n-nonane concentration of air samples collected at Brunel University, England was 10.1 ppb(2). n-Nonane was also identified in the ambient air of Paris, France at concentration ranging from 2.2 to 6.5 ug/cu m(3). n-Nonane has been detected (unspecified concentrations) in the air of Bilbao, Spain(4). The concentration of n-nonane in the urban atmosphere of Barcelona, Spain has been reported to be 3.2 ug/cu m(5). In 1983-4, the respective minimum, maximum and average outdoor air concentration of n-nonane in northern Italy were less than 1, 9, and 2.1 ug/cu m(6). The same study determined the respective minimum, maximum and average indoor air concentration of n-nonane for 14 homes and an office building were less than 1, 165, and 27 ug/cu m(6). The concentration range of n-nonane measured in the atmosphere of Athens, Greece during the summers of 1993 and 1994 was 0.5-2.7 ppbV(7). The concentration of n-nonane in the downtown air of Zurich Switzerland was 1.7 ppb(8). At Deuselbach, Hunsruck in Germany, the atmospheric n-nonane concentration was less than 0.01 ppb in October, 1983(9). Reported 1990 annual averages of n-nonane in the atmosphere at several locations in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany range from 0.17-1.2 ug/cu m(10). n-Nonane was detected in Berlin air at a residential area and a street site with average concentrations of 0.56 and 0.77 ug/cu m, respectively(11). The background concentration was 0.20 ug/cu m(11). The maximum n-nonane concentration measured in the outdoor air of 300 Dutch homes was 8 ug/cu m(12). In the Netherlands, the average n-nonane concentration in ambient air were 2.2 and 0.5 ppb for 20 and 24 samples, respectively(13). n-Nonane was detected (unspecified concentrations) in the atmosphere above 6 industrialized cities of the former USSR ranging in size of population from 0.4 to 4.5 million people(14-16).",

In a separate study, the concentrations of n-nonane in an alkyd primer and three interior alkyd enamel paints were 18.4, 3.49, 7.55, and 0.79 mg/g, respectively(5). Analysis of six fine (foliar) fuels common to fire-prone US ecosystems revealed the presence of n-nonane in the primarily carbonaceous PM2.5 particulate matter as follows (biomass type (mg/kg biomass burned): in Pinaceae - loblolly pine (9.8); Western hemlock (10.0); Ponderosa pine (19.7); in mixed systems: Acereae/Fagaceae (7.1); Palmea/Pinaceae (4.4): Poceae/Pinaceae (6.6)(6). n-Nonane was present at concentrations of 1 ppmv and in biogas collected from a municipal sewage waste treatment plant in Linkoeping, Sweden(7).",

The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to n-nonane is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from gasoline and other petroleum products. Monitoring data also indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-nonane via ingestion of food and drinking water, although these pathways are considered minor when compared to inhalation(SRC).",

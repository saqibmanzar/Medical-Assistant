When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Cilostazol has been shown to induce vascular dilatation, but its efficacy in patients with VSA is unknown. Between October 2011 and July 2012, 50 patients with confirmed VSA who had >/= 1 angina episodes/week despite amlodipine therapy (5 mg/day) were randomly assigned to receive either cilostazol (up to 200 mg/day) or placebo for 4 weeks. All patients were given diaries to record the frequency and severity of chest pain (0-10 grading). The primary endpoint was the relative reduction of the weekly incidence of chest pain. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Among 49 evaluable patients (25 in the cilostazol group, 24 in the placebo group), the primary endpoint was significantly greater in the cilostazol group compared with the placebo group (-66.5 +/- 88.6% vs -17.6 +/- 140.1%, respectively, p=0.009). The secondary endpoints, including a change in the frequency of chest pain (-3.7 +/- 0.5 vs -1.9 +/- 0.6, respectively, p=0.029), a change in the chest pain severity scale (-2.8 +/- 0.4 vs -1.1 +/- 0.4, respectively, p=0.003), and the proportion of chest pain-free patients (76.0% vs 33.3%, respectively, p=0.003) also significantly favoured cilostazol. Headache was the most common adverse event in both groups (40.0% vs 20.8%, respectively, p=0.217). Cilostazol is an effective therapy for patients with VSA uncontrolled by conventional amlodipine therapy, and has no serious side effects.",

After oral administration, area under serum concentration-time curve (AUC) was about 35-fold higher in female rats than in male rats, and absolute bioavailability was about 5.8-fold higher in female rats than in male rats. Total body clearance (CL(total)) for female rats was around one-sixth of that for male rats. In vivo hepatic clearance (CL(h)) calculated based on isolated liver perfusion studies was even higher than or around 90% of the in vivo CL(total) of cilostazol for female and male rats, respectively, indicating that cilostazol is mainly eliminated by the liver in both male and female rats. In vitro metabolism studies utilizing hepatic microsomes and recombinant cytochrome (CYP) isoforms clearly indicated that major metabolites of cilostazol were generated extensively with hepatic microsomes of male rats and that male-predominant CYP3A2 and male-specific CYP2C11 were mainly responsible for the hepatic metabolism of cilostazol. Therefore, the great sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of cilostazol were mainly attributed to the large difference in hepatic metabolism. Our experimental results also suggested that the substantial metabolism of cilostazol in the small intestine and its possible saturation would be responsible for dose-dependent bioavailability in both male and female rats.",

However, the effect of cilostazol on hepatic steatosis has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the effect of cilostazol on hepatic ABCA1 expression and hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obesity mice model. Hepatic ABCA1 expression and lipid accumulation were analyzed in HepG2 cell lines treated with cilostazol. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: (1) fed normal chow diet with vehicle; (2) fed high-fat diet (HFD) with vehicle; (3) fed HFD with cilostazol. Cilostazol (30 mg/kg) was orally administered once daily for 9 weeks. Cilostazol significantly enhanced ABCA1 expression and restored ABCA1 expression reduced by palmitate in HepG2 cells. Cilostazol treatment ameliorated lipid accumulation induced by palmitate, and this effect was diminished when ABCA1 or LRP1 was silenced by small interference RNA. After silencing of LRP1, ABCA1 expression was decreased in HepG2 cells. Cilostazol significantly enhanced hepatic ABCA1 expression and decreased hepatic fat in HFD-fed mice. Hepatic expression of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP1 was also decreased in HFD-fed mice treated with cilostazol. Cilostazol ameliorated hepatic steatosis and increased ABCA1 expression in the hepatocytes. Enhancing ABCA1 expression with cilostazol represents a potential therapeutic avenue for treatment of hepatic steatosis.",

Although the mechanism of action of cilostazol has not been fully elucidated, the drug appears to inhibit activation of cellular PDE type III (PDE III), resulting in suppressed degradation, and thus increased concentrations, of cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets and blood vessels. Increased cAMP concentrations are thought to result in arterial vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation.",

As the oral drug Pletal, it is indicated for the reduction of symptoms of intermittent claudication. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose may include severe headache, diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia, and possibly cardiac arrhythmias. ANIMAL STUDIES: No cardiovascular lesions were seen in rats following 5 or 13 weeks of administration of cilostazol at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day. At this dose, systemic exposures (AUCs) to unbound cilostazol were only about 1.5 and 5 times (male and female rats, respectively) the exposure seen in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Repeated oral administration of cilostazol to dogs produced cardiovascular lesions that included endocardial hemorrhage, hemosiderin deposition and fibrosis in the left ventricle, hemorrhage in the right atrial wall, hemorrhage and necrosis of the smooth muscle in the wall of the coronary artery, intimal thickening of the coronary artery, and coronary arteritis and periarteritis. At the lowest dose associated with cardiovascular lesions in the 52-week study, AUC to unbound cilostazol was less than that seen in humans at the MRHD of 100 mg twice daily. In a rat developmental toxicity study, oral administration of 1000 mg cilostazol/kg/day was associated with decreased fetal weights, and increased incidences of cardiovascular, renal, and skeletal anomalies (ventricular septal, aortic arch and subclavian artery abnormalities, renal pelvic dilation, 14th rib, and retarded ossification). Cilostazol tested negative in bacterial gene mutation, bacterial DNA repair, mammalian cell gene mutation, and mouse in vivo bone marrow chromosomal aberration assays. It was, however, associated with a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell assay. Dietary administration of cilostazol to rats and mice for up to 104 weeks revealed no evidence of carcinogenic potential. The maximum doses administered in both rat and mouse studies were, on a systemic exposure basis, less than the human exposure at the MRHD of the drug.",

We observed that the blood glucose level varied in parallel with the heart rate immediately after starting or stopping cilostazol therapy in three patients with type 2 diabetes. This finding indicates that cilostazol induces hyperglycemia and tachycardia in a portion of diabetic patients, presumably via similar pharmacological effects on different organs. Much more attention should be paid to the possible effects of cilostazol on glycemic control, including taking into consideration the risk-benefit ratio of cilostazol use and individual circumstances.",

Cilostazol has been shown to exhibit vascular protection in ischemic diseases. Although vascular endothelium-derived prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) plays an important role in vascular protection, it is unknown whether cilostazol directly stimulates PGI2 synthesis in endothelial cells. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of cilostazol-induced PGI2 stimulation in endothelial cells. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were stimulated with cilostazol and PGI2 accumulation in the culture media was measured. Cilostazol increased PGI2 synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. Cilostazol-induced intracellular calcium also promoted PGI2 synthesis via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. Using RNAi, silencing of PDE3B abolished the induction effect of cilostazol on PGI2 synthesis and intracellular cAMP accumulation. Inhibition of the exchange protein, which was directly activated by cyclic AMP 1 (Epac-1) and its downstream signal the Ras-like small GTPase (Rap-1), abolished cilostazol-induced PGI2 synthesis, but this did not take place via protein kinase A (PKA). Inhibition of downstream signaling, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) gamma, and phospholipase C (PLC) e, suppressed cilostazol-induced PGI2 synthesis. The PDE3/Epac-1/Rap-1 signaling pathway plays an important role in cilostazol-induced PGI2 synthesis. Namely, stimulation of HAECs with cilostazol induces intracellular calcium elevation via the Rap-1/PLCe/IP3 pathway, along with MAPK activation via direct activation by Epac-1/Rap-1 and indirect activation by Epac-1/Rap-1/PI3Kgamma, resulting in synergistically induced PGI2 synthesis.",

In this study, the effects of cilostazol on lipid metabolism and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity were studied in rats. Cilostazol was administered orally at doses of 30 or 100 mg/kg twice a day for 1-2 weeks to rats. Cilostazol decreased the serum triglyceride level in normolipidemic rats. The serum triglyceride level was reduced and HDL cholesterol level was increased by cilostazol in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The disappearance of exogenous triglyceride was accelerated by cilostazol in normolipidemic rats. Cilostazol increased post-heparin plasma LPL activity but had no effect on hepatic triglyceride lipase activity in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Cilostazol also increased LPL activity in the heart in STZ-induced diabetic rats. These findings suggest that an increase in LPL activity is responsible for the serum triglyceride lowering and HDL cholesterol elevating effects of cilostazol in rats.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

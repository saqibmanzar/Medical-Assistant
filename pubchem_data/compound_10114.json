After administration, enoxolone inhibits the metabolism of prostaglandins by both 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase [NAD(+)] and prostaglandin reductase 2. Therefore, this agent potentiates the activity of prostaglandin E2 and F2alpha, which inhibits gastric secretion while stimulating pancreatic secretion and the secretion of intestinal and respiratory mucus, leading to increased intestinal motility and antitussive effects. Additionally, this agent inhibits 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and other enzymes involved in the conversion of cortisol to cortisone in the kidneys.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

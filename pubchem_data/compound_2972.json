When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Homozygous mutations in the frataxine (FXN) gene reduce expression of frataxin and cause accumulation of iron in the mitochondria. Deferiprone, an oral iron chelator, has been shown effective in cell and animal models of Friedreich ataxia. The results of a 6-month randomized, double blind placebo-controlled study suggested that deferiprone 20 mg/kg/day may reduce disease progression. The authors present their experience of 5 Friedreich ataxia patients treated with deferiprone (20 mg/kg/day), in addition to idebenone treatment, followed over a period of 10-24 months, under off-label authorization. The patients were monitored for laboratory parameters, cardiac assessment, neurological evaluations, and quality of life. The authors conclude that combined therapy of a low dose of deferiprone with idebenone is relatively safe, might improve neurological function, and seems to improve heart hypertrophy, warranting further studies.",

Low ceruloplasmin (CP)-ferroxidase activity has been identified in the SN and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with PD. The iron chelator, deferiprone, reduces the abnormally high levels of iron in the SN. In order to determine CP's involvement in iron accumulation in SN and PD progression, we aim to compare the ability of iron chelation treatment to reducing both SN iron levels and motor handicap in PD patients according to the level of ceruloplasmin activity. We used a moderate chelation protocol with deferiprone (DFP) based on a, 6-month delayed-start paradigm, randomized placebo controlled clinical trial in 40 PD patients. CP-ferroxidase activity was determined in blood and CSF together with the D544E gene polymorphism (rs701753). Iron levels were determined by R2* MRI sequence and the motor handicap by the UPDRS motor score. After 6 to 12 months of DFP treatment, greater reductions in SN iron levels and UPDRS motor scores were obtained in patients with higher serum and CSF levels of CP-ferroxidase activity. After 6 months of DFP treatment, the AT genotype group displayed greater reduction of iron level in the SN with greater CSF and serum levels of CP activity than the AA genotype group. Although most of the DFP-treated patients displayed clinical and radiological improvements, those with the lower CP activity appeared to respond better to iron chelation. Larger RCTs are now needed to establish whether pharmacological modulation of CP activity could be an innovative neuroprotective strategy in PD.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It is indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes when current chelation therapy is inadequate. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: No cases of acute overdose have been reported. However, neurological disorders such as cerebellar symptoms, diplopia, lateral nystagmus, psychomotor slowdown, hand movements and axial hypotonia have been observed in children treated with 2.5 to 3 times the recommended dose for more than one year. The neurological disorders progressively regressed after deferiprone discontinuation. At the prescribed dose, deferiprone can cause agranulocytosis that can lead to serious infections and death. Neutropenia may precede the development of agranulocytosis. Based on evidence of genotoxicity and developmental toxicity in animal studies, deferiprone can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  ANIMAL STUDIES: Single oral doses of deferiprone of up to 100 mg/kg to mice and rats produced transient hypersalivation, whereas higher doses (300-600 mg/kg) affected behavior, decreased performance and body temperature, and affected passive avoidance and motility. At doses lower than those used clinically, deferiprone has been shown to penetrate the blood brain barrier in rats, and to interfere with dopamine and serotonin metabolism through inhibitory effects on catechol-O-methyltransferase and tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases. In a 12-month rodent toxicology study, following administration of deferiprone at doses of 150 or 200 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses (75 or 100 mg/kg bid), to non-iron-loaded or iron-loaded rats, respectively, 7 of 50 non-iron-loaded and 3 of 50 iron-loaded animals were either found dead or sacrificed moribund with severe anemia and slight to moderate centrilobular degeneration and necrosis. Animals from which blood samples could be collected prior to their unscheduled termination had elevated levels of total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and/or alanine aminotransferase of up to ca. 8, 4, and 14 times their respective group mean control value. These findings could be ascribed to hypoxia due to severe anemia (hemoglobin concentration <2.5 g/dL). No findings of severe anemia with or without centrilobular degeneration and necrosis, or isolated findings of centrilobular degeneration and necrosis, were noted in non-iron-loaded or iron-loaded survivors. Relatively mild decreases in RBC and WBC counts in surviving rats partially reversed during a 4-week off-dose period following 12 months' treatment; recovery of bone marrow hypocellularity was complete in iron-loaded, but partial in non-iron-loaded, animals. The mean relative weight of the adrenal and pituitary gland was significantly greater in non-iron-loaded rats given 75 mg/kg deferiprone bid as compared to non-iron-loaded untreated rats. Skeletal and soft tissue malformations occurred in offspring of rats and rabbits that received deferiprone orally during organogenesis at the lowest doses tested (25 mg/kg per day in rats; 10 mg/kg per day in rabbits). These doses were equivalent to 3% to 4% of the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. No maternal toxicity was evident at these doses. Embryofetal lethality and maternal toxicity occurred in pregnant rabbits given 100 mg/kg/day deferiprone orally during the period of organogenesis. This dose is equivalent to 32% of the MRHD based on body surface area. A fertility and early embryonic development study of deferiprone was conducted in rats. Sperm counts, motility and morphology were unaffected by treatment with deferiprone. There were no effects observed on male or female fertility or reproductive function at the highest dose which was 25% of the MRHD based on body surface area.  Deferiprone was positive in a mouse lymphoma cell assay in vitro. Deferiprone was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration test in mice and in a chromosomal aberration test in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Deferiprone given orally or intraperitoneally was clastogenic in a bone marrow micronucleus assay in non-iron-loaded mice. A micronucleus test was also positive when mice pre-dosed with iron dextran were treated with deferiprone. Deferiprone was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation test.",

In vitro studies suggest that UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A6 is primarily responsible for the glucuronidation of deferiprone which can be reduced up to 78% in the presence of the UGT1A6 inhibitor phenylbutazone. However, the clinical significance of coadministration of Ferriprox with a UGT1A6 inhibitor (e.g. diclofenac, probenecid, or silymarin (milk thistle)) on the systemic exposure of deferiprone has not been determined. Closely monitor patients for adverse reactions that may require downward dose titration or interruption when Ferriprox is concomitantly administered with a UGT1A6 inhibitor.",

The neurological abnormalities resolved with stoppage of deferiprone. Central nervous system toxicity and lenticular opacities may be attributed to the low molecular weight of deferiprone and its ability to cross the blood-brain and blood-ocular barrier, respectively. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of neurological abnormalities that may occur during deferiprone therapy.",

The blood counts, checked weekly, dropped markedly between weeks 8 and 9. She rapidly developed a septicemia and was admitted with high fever (40.9 degrees C), white blood cell count 0.4 x 10(9)/L, absolute neutrophil count 0.1 x 10(9)/L and platelets 114 x 10(9)/L. She was administered broad spectrum antibiotics, G-CSF (10 ug/kg daily) and corticosteroids but remained neutropenic and died 6 weeks after admission. Bone marrow examination day 23 revealed areas with low cellularity (around 30%), but also areas with infiltrates of T cells; granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis were scarce. We conclude that weekly neutrophil monitoring is not sufficient to avoid fatal agranulocytosis. We suggest that deferiprone not be prescribed to DBA patients unless the clinical indications are particularly strong, and that the risk of agranulocytosis in thalassemia patients be carefully considered.",

At doses lower than those used clinically, deferiprone has been shown to penetrate the blood brain barrier in rats, and to interfere with dopamine and serotonin metabolism through inhibitory effects on catechol-O-methyltransferase and tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases.",

L1 was administered to male uremic rats by gastric intubation at 0, 20, 40, 80 or 160 mg/kg/d for 4 w. Body weight and food and fluid intake were monitored daily. Complete hematologic examinations, serum biochemical parameter determinations and histological examinations were carried out. Although body weight gain was significantly reduced at 80 and 160 mg/kg/d, there were no effects of L1 on food and fluid consumption. There were no significant differences between controls and L1-treated groups in most of the hematological and biochemical parameters analyzed. No significant dose-dependent changes in relative organ weights were noted. The non-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for L1 in uremic rats was 40 mg/kg/d. According to the results of this study, uremia did not increase the toxic effects of L1.",

The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

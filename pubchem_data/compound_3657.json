ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 2 hours and by 24 hours the serum concentrations are virtually zero. Bioavailability is complete or nearly complete in cancer patients.  After oral administration of 20 mg/kg of hydroxyurea, a rapid absorption is observed with peak plasma levels of about 30 mg/L occurring after 0.75 and 1.2 h in children and adult patients with sickle cell syndrome, respectively. The total exposure up to 24 h post-dose is 124 mg.h/L in children and adolescents and 135 mg.h/L in adult patients. The oral bioavailability of hydroxyurea is almost complete as assessed in indications other than sickle cell syndrome.  In a comparative bioavailability study in healthy adult volunteers (n=28), 500 mg of hydroxyurea oral solution was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the reference 500 mg capsule, with respect to both the peak concentration and area under the curve. There was a statistically significant reduction in time to peak concentration with hydroxyurea oral solution compared to the reference 500 mg capsule (0.5 versus 0.75 hours, p = 0.0467), indicating a faster rate of absorption.[L47137   In a study of children with Sickle Cell Disease, liquid and capsule formulations resulted in similar area under the curve, peak concentrations, and half-life. The largest difference in the pharmacokinetic profile was a trend towards a shorter time to peak concentration following ingestion of the liquid compared with the capsule, but that difference did not reach statistical significance (0.74 versus 0.97 hours, p = 0.14).",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

However, the reports of various studies in rat and human tissue cultures lend support to the hypothesis that hydroxyurea causes an immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis, by acting as a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, without interfering with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or of protein. Hydroxyurea probably acts by decreasing the rate of conversion of ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. This effect is particularly apparent in cells with a high rate of proliferation. Particularly, hydroxyurea reduces the tyrosyl free radical at the active site of the M2 via a one-electron transfer reaction through the \u2013NH2-OH moiety.  Three mechanisms have been postulated for the potentiation of the therapeutic effects of irradiation by hydroxyurea on squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinomas of the head and neck. In vitro studies utilizing Chinese hamster cells suggest that hydroxyurea is lethal to normally radioresistant S-stage cells and holds other cells of the cell cycle in the G1 or pre-DNA synthesis stage where they are most susceptible to the effects of irradiation. The third mechanism of action has been theorized on the basis of in vitro studies of HeLa cells: it appears that hydroxyurea, by inhibition of DNA synthesis, hinders the normal repair process of cells damaged but not killed by irradiation, thereby decreasing their survival rate; there is no alteration of RNA and protein syntheses.  Another proposed mechanism of action of hydroxyurea is the elevation of HbF concentrations in Sickle Cell Disease patients. HbF interferes with the polymerization of HbS (sickle haemoglobin) and thus impedes the sickling of red blood cell. Recently, hydroxyurea has shown to be associated with the generation of nitric oxide, suggesting that nitric oxide stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphates (cGMP) production, which then activates a protein kinase and increases the production of HbF. Other known pharmacological effects of hydroxycarbamide which may contribute to its beneficial effects in Sickle Cell Disease include decrease of neutrophils, improved deformability of sickled cells, and altered adhesion of red blood cells to the endothelium.",

Some studies indicate that hydroxyurea interferes with the synthesis of DNA without interfering with the synthesis of RNA or protein. Although hydroxyurea may have multiple sites of action, it appears likely that the drug inhibits the incorporation of thymidine into DNA; in addition, it may directly damage DNA. Hydroxyurea can destroy the tyrosyl free radical that is formed as the catalytic center of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reductive conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides; this conversion is a critical and probably rate-limiting step in the synthesis of DNA. The drug is an S-phase inhibitor and may cause cells to arrest at the G1-S border, decrease the rate of cell progression into the S phase, and/or cause cells to accumulate in the S phase as a result of inhibiting DNA synthesis. Animal studies indicate that the cytotoxic effects of hydroxyurea are limited to those tissues with high rates of cellular proliferation and the effects are evident only in those cells that are actively synthesizing DNA.",

Hydroxyurea inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA synthesis in activated peripheral blood lymphocytes by decreasing the amount of intracellular deoxynucleotides, thus suggesting that this drug has an antiviral effect. Hydroxyurea has now been shown to block HIV-1 replication in acutely infected primary human lymphocytes (quiescent and activated) and macrophages, as well as in blood cells infected in vivo obtained from individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The antiviral effect was achieved at nontoxic doses of hydroxyurea, lower than those currently used in human therapy. Combination of hydroxyurea with the nucleoside analog didanosine (2'3'-dideoxyinosine, or ddi) generated a synergistic inhibitory effect without increasing toxicity. In some instances, inhibition of HIV-1 by hydroxyurea was irreversible, even several weeks after suspension of drug treatment. The indirect inhibition of HIV-1 by hydroxyurea is not expected to generate high rates of escape mutants. Hydroxyurea therefore appears to be a possible candidate for AIDS therapy.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HU-mediated HbF regulation remain unclear. We previously reported that overexpression of the HU-induced SAR1 gene closely mimics the known effects of HU on K562 and CD34(+) cells, including gamma-globin induction and cell-cycle regulation. Here, we show that HU stimulated nuclear factor-kB interaction with its cognate-binding site on the SAR1 promoter to regulate transcriptional expression of SAR1 in K562 and CD34(+) cells. Silencing SAR1 expression not only significantly lowered both basal and HU-elicited HbF production in K562 and CD34(+) cells, but also significantly reduced HU-mediated S-phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in K562 cells. Inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/Jun phosphorylation and silencing of Gia expression in SAR1-transfected K562 and CD34(+) cells reduced both gamma-globin expression and HbF level, indicating that activation of Gia/JNK/Jun proteins is required for SAR1-mediated HbF induction. Furthermore, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed an association between forcibly expressed SAR1 and Gia2 or Gia3 proteins in both K562 and nonerythroid cells. These results indicate that HU induces SAR1, which in turn activates gamma-globin expression, predominantly through the Gia/JNK/Jun pathway. Our findings identify SAR1 as an alternative therapeutic target for beta-globin disorders.",

The entire replitase complex, including ribonucleotide reductase, is inactivated and DNA synthesis is selectively inhibited, producing cell death in S phase and synchronization of the fraction of cells that survive. Repair of DNA damaged by chemicals or irradiation is also inhibited by hydroxyurea, offering potential synergy between hydroxyurea and radiation or alkylating agents. Hydroxyurea renders cells sensitive to bleomycin because the quenched tyrosyl free radical no longer stabilizes the adjacent iron center, making it more susceptible to the chelating properties of bleomycin, which then produces active oxygen. Synergy has also been observed between hydroxyurea and a number of other chemotherapeutic agents, including cytarabine and etoposide. Recently, two new effects of hydroxyurea have been observed: hydroxyurea increases the level of fetal hemoglobin, leading to a reduction in the incidence of vasoocclusive crises in sickle cell anemia, and hydroxyurea selectively reduces the level of episomal DNA and thus potentially may reduce drug resistance associated with duplicated genes retained as episomes.",

FA proteins participate in the FA/BRCA pathway that plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA damage induced by crosslinking compounds. Hydroxyurea (HU) is an agent that induces replicative stress by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which synthesizes deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) necessary for DNA replication and repair. HU is known to activate the FA pathway; however, its clastogenic effects are not well characterized. We have investigated the effects of HU treatment alone or in sequential combination with mitomycin-C (MMC) on FA patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines from groups FA-A, B, C, D1/BRCA2, and E and on lymphocytes from two unclassified FA patients. All FA cells showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) in chromosomal aberrations following treatment with HU during the last 3 h before mitosis. Furthermore, when FA cells previously exposed to MMC were treated with HU, we observed an increase of MMC-induced DNA damage that was characterized by high occurrence of DNA breaks and a reduction in rejoined chromosomal aberrations. These findings show that exposure to HU during G2 induces chromosomal aberrations by a mechanism that is independent of its well-known role in replication fork stalling during S-phase and that HU interfered mainly with the rejoining process of DNA damage. We suggest that impaired oxidative stress response, lack of an adequate amount of dNTPs for DNA repair due to RNR inhibition, and interference with cell cycle control checkpoints underlie the clastogenic activity of HU in FA cells.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

It is a drug indicated for the following uses: the treatment of resistant chronic myeloid leukemia; treatment of locally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (excluding the lip) in combination with chemoradiation; the palliative treatment of sickle cell anemia generally in patients with recurrent moderate to severe painful crises occurring on at least 3 occasions during the preceding 12 months  (designated an orphan drug by the US Food and Drug Administration for this use). HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: During a 2-year period, 26 patients taking hydroxyurea for more than 6 months who had consultations at the dermatology department were systematically examined regarding cutaneous side effects. All but one had cutaneous side-effects, including dryness, moderate alopecia, increased skin pigmentation, melanonychia, cutaneous atrophy, leg ulcers, plantar keratoderma, pseudodermatomyositis, lichen planus-like eruption on the dorsum of the hands actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinomas, and mouth ulcerations. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV infection treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral drugs. Fatal hepatic failure were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine (note: hydroxyurea is not indicated for the treatment of HIV infection). In one case of an 85-year-old man taking hydroxyurea for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, severe interstitial pneumonitis was induced by the drug. Gangrene of the toes and digits is a rare but very severe complication of long-term hydroxyurea therapy. A retrospective review of four adult men who had semen analysis during hydroxyurea therapy and in three cases after its cessation, suggests that the drug generally reduces sperm counts and motility and results in abnormal morphology. Hydroxyurea induced DNA hypermethylation in normal human embryonic lung fibroblasts and their simian virus 40-transformed counterparts. While cancer has been observed in some patients receiving long-term treatment with hydroxyurea, the drug is not yet classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. ANIMAL STUDIES:  Symptoms of exposure in dogs have included vomiting, ataxia, methemoglobinemia, tachycardia, lethargy, and hypothermia. Groups of 50 mice of each sex were treated intraperitoneally with hydroxyurea starting at two days of age and then at weekly intervals for one year. The incidences of pulmonary tumors were 30/50 (60%) in control and 16/35 (46%) in treated mice.  Hydroxyurea is a swiftly acting developmental toxicant that inhibits DNA synthesis and is teratogenic in all mammals studied. Data from a study on mice suggest that hydroxyurea compromises folliculogenesis and the ability of generated embryos to develop. A group of 27 pregnant golden hamsters received an intravenous injection of 50 mg/kg bw hydroxyurea on day 8 of pregnancy. A high rate of fetal death and malformations, especially of the central nervous system, was observed. Hydroxyurea caused cell transformation in mass cultures of embryonic cells from mice, but not in cultures derived from two other strains of mice, nor in BALB/c 3T3 cells. Hydroxyurea treatment led to hypermethylation of DNA in hamster fibrosarcoma cells. Hydroxyurea was inactive as either a frameshift or base-pair substitution mutagen in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1537, TA1535, TA98 and TA100, and addition of an exogenous metabolic activation system did not affect these results. Hydroxyurea induced SOS repair in Escherichia coli K12 cells. In various Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, hydroxyurea induced mitotic crossing over, mitotic gene conversion, intrachromosomal recombination and aneuploidy, but not petite mutations. It also increased the frequency of ultraviolet-induced mitotic gene conversion and induced recombination in dividing but not G1 or G2 arrested cells of the RS112 strain of yeast. In meiotic yeast cells, hydroxyurea increased the frequency of meiotic recombination. Hydroxyurea induced micronuclei in the bone marrow of non-tumor-bearing male NMRI mice but did not induce micronucleated cells in female C57BL/6 C3H/He hybrid mice, although it produced sperm abnormalities in male mice of this strain.",

The entire replicase complex, including ribonucleotide reductase, is inactivated and DNA synthesis is selectively inhibited, producing cell death in S phase and synchronization of the fraction of cells that survive. Repair of DNA damaged by chemicals or irradiation is also inhibited by hydroxyurea, offering potential synergy between hydroxyurea and radiation or alkylating agents. Hydroxyurea also increases the level of fetal hemoglobin, leading to a reduction in the incidence of vasoocclusive crises in sickle cell anemia. Levels of fetal hemoglobin increase in response to activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) by hydroxyurea-derived NO.",

The cases of severe hepatitis attributed to hydroxyurea have been described largely in patients with HIV infection on antiretroviral regimens that include agents associated with hepatotoxicity, but the addition of hydroxyurea appeared to be responsible for the liver injury, these patients later tolerating resumption of antiretroviral therapy without recurrence.",

Some brand names for hydroxyurea are Hydrea\u00ae and Siklos\u00ae.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take your medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.People with sickle cell disease can have healthy pregnancies. Close monitoring by your healthcare team during pregnancy is important. Having sickle cell disease itself can increase the chance of pregnancy complications including the chance of miscarriage, preterm delivery (birth before 37 weeks), low birth weight (weighing less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces [2500 grams] at birth), and stillbirth. The chance of health problems that result from being pregnant and giving birth are increased in people with sickle cell disease.

Data were obtained from patients followed longitudinally by the Johns Hopkins AIDS Services. Incidence rates of development of neuropathy were calculated for each of five regimens: didanosine (+/- hydroxyurea), didanosine + stauvudine (+/- hydroxyurea), and stauvudine. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to compare the relative risk of neuropathy for each regimen adjusting for CD4 cell count, other drugs received, and time on therapy.  A total of 1116 patients received at least one of the five regimens. There were 117 cases of neuropathy. The crude incidence rate of neuropathy ranged from 6.8 cases per 100 person-years for didanosine to 28.6 cases per 100 person-years for didanosine + stauvudine + hydroxyurea. Compared with didanosine alone, and adjusting for CD4 cell counts and other variables, the relative risk of neuropathy was 1.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-2.32] for stauvudine alone, 2.35 (95% CI: 0.69-8.07) for didanosine + hydroxyurea, 3.50 (95% CI: 1.81-6.77) for didanosine + stauvudine, and 7.80 (95% CI: 3.92-15.5) for didanosine + stauvudine + hydroxyurea. Based on the data, the risk of neuropathy is additive or even synergistic for didanosine + stauvudine + hydroxyurea compared with didanosine or stauvudine alone. The combination of didanosine + stauvudine also increases the risk of neuropathy but less than when hydroxyurea is included.",

Twenty-six patients were examined. All but one had cutaneous side-effects, including dryness (n = 16), moderate alopecia (n = 2), increased skin pigmentation (n = 5), melanonychia, single (n = 1) or multiple (n = 7), cutaneous atrophy (n = 4), leg ulcers (n = 8), plantar keratoderma (n = 3), pseudodermatomyositis (n = 1), lichen planus-like eruption on the dorsum of the hands (n = 2), actinic keratosis (n = 8), squamous cell carcinomas (n = 2), and mouth ulcerations (n = 1). This study shows that the frequency of hydroxyurea cutaneous side-effects diagnosed in 95% of studied patients is underestimated. They are usually benign, but some of them, in particular leg ulcers and squamous cell carcinomas, lead to modification of the treatment (39% of studied patients).",

A group of eight sheep received 4.1 g/day of hydroxyurea for 4 to 6 days, and six sheep received two to four doses of 0.4 mg/kg of nitrogen mustard before exposure to 100% O2. A group of seven sheep breathed 100% O2 with no drug treatment. A group of five control sheep breathed compressed air for 96 hours. Hydroxyurea selectively reduced circulating neutrophils (602 + or - 245 neutrophils, 2,537 + or - 394 lymphocytes per cu mm), and nitrogen mustard decreased both circulating neutrophils (633 + or - 326) and lymphocytes (521 + or - 129). In untreated sheep breathing 100% O2, survival time was 92.6 + or - 3.4 hours and postmortem blood free lung water to dry lung ratio was 4.4 + or - 0.2. Hydroxyurea significantly delayed the onset of oxygen toxicity as measured by changes in lung lymph flow, PaO2, PaCO2, and time to respiratory failure (111.8 + or - 7.7 hours), although the degree of final lung injury was unchanged and postmortem lung water was elevated (5.3 + or - 0.3). Nitrogen mustard shortened the time to hypoxemia, and CO2 retention and decreased time to respiratory failure (84.0 + or - 4.3 hours). Neutrophils were markedly reduced but not absent in the lungs of both groups of leukocyte depleted sheep. It was concluded that neutrophils are not essential for the full expression of lung O2 toxicity in adult sheep. Secondary effects of hydroxyurea and nitrogen mustard appear to influence the rate of development, but not the outcome of oxygen toxicity, by effects independent of leukocyte depletion.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.016 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecanamine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecanamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours. If released to soil, N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecanamine is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 21,700. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.9X10-3 atm-cu m/mole; however adsorption may attenuate this process. N,N-Dimethyl-1-dodecanamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. N,N-Dimethyl-1-dodecanamine is expected to biodegrade in soils and water based on screening tests using activated sludge. If released into water, N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecanamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 6 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is estimated as 160 days if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 310 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecanamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N,N-dimethyl-1-dodecanamine is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

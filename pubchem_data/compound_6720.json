Conjunctivitis with corneal injury has been reported in humans when pentachloronitrobenzene was splashed into the eye. No information is available on the chronic (long- term), reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of pentachloronitrobenzene in humans. Chronic exposure of dogs to pentachloronitrobenzene in their diet has been observed to result in damage to the liver. Renal agenesis (failure of the kidney to develop), cleft palate, and increased fetal mortality were observed in the offspring of orally exposed mice. Hepatomas were observed in mice exposed to pentachloronitrobenzene via gavage (experimentally placing the chemical in the stomach). EPA has classified pentachloronitrobenzene as a Group C, possible human carcinogen.",

It is also used to prevent the formation of slime in industrial waters. It is either an off-white or yellow solid, depending on its purity, with a musty odor. Residual amounts of the compound and its metabolites can be found in crops. The degradation products, PCA and PCTA have been found in farming soils and in river sediments. Its mode of action is through contact and interferes with mitotic division.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Moreover the overall conclusion of this evaluation is that the information available is insufficient to satisfy the requirements set out in Annex II and Annex III Directive 91/414/EEC in particular with regard to the environmental fate and ecotoxicology of the substance and its main metabolite and with regard to certain data gaps concerning mammalian toxicology and residues. Based on the information available and the proposed conditions of use it was concluded that a risk of non-target organisms exposed to quintozene cannot be excluded and that there are concerns on the persistence of the active substance and on the safety of operators and consumers. In conclusion from the assessments made on the basis of the submitted information, no plant protection products containing the active substance concerned is expected to satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5 (1) (a) and (b) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC.",

Survival among male mice was low, not all livers were examined from dosed female mice, and the size of the control group was considered to be small. For these reasons, the NCI decided to conduct additional 13-week and 2-year studies in B6C3F1 mice. Under the conditions of the NCI studies, pentachloronitrobenzene was not carcinogenic in either Osborne-Mendel rats or B6C3F1 mice.",

At increased dosages of the components in the combinations PCNB-HgCl2 and PCNB-CdCl2, the combined lethality tended towards the sums of the effects of the individual doses.",

If a large amount of the fungicide has been ingested in the last few hours, and if copious vomiting has not already occurred, it may be reasonable to consider GI decontamination. Activated charcoal can be used along with the addition of the cathartic sorbitol to the charcoal slurry. If sorbitol is given separately, it should be diluted with an equal volume of water before administration. No more than one dose of sorbitol is recommended and it should be used with caution in children and the elderly. If contact with the toxicant has been minimal (for example, oral contamination only, promptly flushed out of the mouth), administration of charcoal without a cathartic, followed by careful observation of the patient, probably represents optimal management. /Substituted benzenes/",

Using logistic regression /the authors estimated the effect of pesticide applications by ZIP code controlling for possible confounders. ... Among long-term residents, pancreatic cancer mortality was elevated for those living in ZIP codes with the highest use of four pesticides: 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-d), captafol, pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB), and dieldrin.

Systemic poisoning has not been reported. Clearance is chiefly via the liver and biliary excretion. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, between 1993 and 1998, 41 cases of PCNB exposure were reported. There were 21 symptomatic cases, including six ranked moderate. Fifteen of the individuals reported in the 41 cases were seen in a health care facility, and one was hospitalized. The California Pesticide Illness Surveillance Program reported 30 PCNB incidents from 1982-1997, most involving PCNB in mixtures with other pesticides. Of the seven case reports for PCNB alone, most were older cases related to eye contamination. Between 1984 and 1991, the National Pesticides Telecommunications Network reported 16 human incidents and five animal incidents associated with PCNB. These numbers are relatively small compared to other pesticides for which incidents have been reported and are consistent with the low acute toxicity of PCNB.",

These doses were selected because, in 13-week studies in which the chemical was administered in feed at doses up to 20,000 ppm in male mice and up to 40,000 ppm in female mice, body weight gain depression was observed at 10,000 ppm and above in males and female and deaths occurred at 40,000 ppm in females.  The National Cancer Institute had conducted 2-year (diet) studies in B6C3F1 mice and Osborne-Mendel rats (See TR-61 reported in 1978). Survival among male mice was low, not all livers were examined from dosed female mice, and the size of the control group was considered to be small. For these reasons, the NCI decided to conduct additional 13-week and 2-year studies in B6C3F1 mice. Under the conditions of the NCI studies, pentachloronitrobenzene was not carcinogenic in either Osborne-Mendel rats or B6C3F1 mice.  In the studies reported in this Technical Report, the survival of male mice was comparable among control and dosed groups (control, 35/50; low dose, 31/50; high dose, 32/50). Final mean body weights of low dose and high dose male mice were 96% and 90% that of the controls. All groups of female mice showed evidence of bacterial infection. At week 84, survival in dosed and control female mice was 38/50; 34/50; 30/50; after week 84, survival in dosed groups decreased, with the final survival being 30/50; 20/50; 15/50. The mean body weight of high dose female mice was more than 10% lower than that of the control group after week 20 and was 21% lower than controls at week 104. The mean body weight of low dose female mice was within 10% that of the control group until week 88 and was 18% lower than controls at week 104. No compound-related neoplastic lesions were seen in either male or female mice. The nonneoplastic lesions observed in female mice were considered to be secondary to bacterial infection (primarily Klebsiella) and included hematopoiesis of the liver (9/50; 21/50; 23/50) and spleen (14/50; 23/48; 27/50), plasma cell hyperplasia of the mediastinal lymph nodes (1/44; 4/47; 9/45), and ovarian abscesses (12/49; 22/50; 29/50).  Pentachloronitrobenzene was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 in the presence or absence of Aroclor 1254-induced male Syrian hamster or male Sprague-Dawley rat liver S9 when tested according to the preincubational protocol. Pentachloronitrobenzene was not mutagenic at the TK+/- locus of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells in the presence or absence of Aroclor 1254-induced F344/N rat liver S9. In cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, pentachloronitrobenzene did not induce sister-chromatid exchanges but did induce chromosomal aberrations both with and without Aroclor 1254-induced male Sprague-Dawley rat liver S9.  An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of pentachloronitrobenzene. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations.  Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity for either male or female B6C3F1 mice receiving 2,500 or 5,000 ppm of pentachloronitrobenzene. Infection is considered to have decreased survival of the female mice and thus reduced the sensitivity for determining the presence or absence of a carcinogenic response.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.0X10-5 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates pentachloronitrobenzene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pentachloronitrobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6 years. Particulate-phase pentachloronitrobenzene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Pentachloronitrobenzene does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelngths greater than 290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pentachloronitrobenzene is expected to be immobile based upon a Koc of 20,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. An average soil half-life of 468 days suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, pentachloronitrobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Results of river: sediment biodegradation studies on pentachloronitrobenzene reveal first-order rate constants that are not that much different than those in sterile water, first order biodegradation rate constant of 0.00456-0.00481/hr vs 0.00380 for a sterile sediment:water system, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 39 hours and 17 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 44 months if adsorption is considered. A BCF range of of 238 to 1,140 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Aqueous photolysis half-lives of 2.5 days and 26.8 hours at pH 5 have been reported. Occupational exposure to pentachloronitrobenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pentachloronitrobenzene is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to pentachloronitrobenzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

Pentachloronitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 5.0X10-5 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 0.44 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 39 hours and 17 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 44 months if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values ranging from 238(8) to 1,140(9) suggesting the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). Aqueous photolysis half-lives of 2.5 days and 26.8 hours at pH 5 have been reported(10). Results of river: sediment biodegradation studies on pentachloronitrobenzene reveal first-order rate constants that are not that much different than those in sterile water, first order biodegradation rate constant of 0.00456-0.00481/hr vs 0.00380 for a sterile sediment:water system(11), suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase pentachloronitrobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6 years(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.2X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase pentachloronitrobenzene may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). Pentachloronitrobenzene does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelngths greater than 290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

In soil treated with pentachloronitrobenzene and incubated at 30 \u00b0C, 40-58% of the pentachloronitrobenzene was degraded in 18 weeks; however, no mineralization occurred(2). Pentachloronitrobenzene residues decreased from 14.6 to 2.20 ppm in 6 months in a lettuce-growing area in Germany(3). In a study conducted in Japan, 2 kg pentachloronitrobenzene/ha was applied and mixed into the top 10 cm of soil (lithosole and gray lowland soil). After 1 month, 5% of the pentachloronitrobenzene had degraded in the top 5 cm; after 8.4 months, 100% had degraded(4). Soil samples from greenhouses in which pentachloronitrobenzene had been regularly used contained pentachloronitrobenzene, pentachloroaniline, pentachlorothioanisole, tetrachloronitrobenzene, tetrachloroaniline, tetrachlorothioanisole, hexachlorobenzene, and pentachlorobenzene (unspecified concns)(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6 years at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). A neutral hydrolysis rate constant of 2.8X10-5/hr was measured for pentachloronitrobenzene at 25 \u00b0C; a half-life of 2.8 years at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C was calculated from this value(2). Sunlight had no pronounced effect on pentachloronitrobenzene upon exposure for progressively longer periods of time in solution, on thin layer plates, or on soil(3). Pentachloronitrobenzene dissolved in hexane or methanol did not degrade after 7 days of exposure to July sunlight in Davis, CA(4). Aqueous photolysis half-lives of 2.5 days and 26.8 hours at pH 5 have been reported; it is stable to soil photolysis(5). After 17 hours exposure to 290 nm light, 43.0% of the pentachloronitrobenzene on silica gel (40 ng pentachloronitrobenzene/g silica gel) was photomineralized to CO2(6).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Pentachloronitrobenzene was not detected in the 15-20 cm sediment layer until 145 weeks after application, at which time pentachloronitrobenzene conc. was 3 ppm. During the 145 week experiment, no pentachloronitrobenzene was detected (detection limit of 0.002 mg/kg) in the 20-25 cm sediment layer(1). Pentachloronitrobenzene did not move (avg Rf value = 0.00) in a soil thin-layer chromatography experiment using Hagerstown silty clay loam (2.50% organic matter, 39.5% clay, pH 6.8)(2). In a soil extraction experiment, about 75% of pentachloronitrobenzene was retained in natural soil after 3 extractions (2 days each) with excess water(3). Pentachloronitrobenzene, present in raw wastewater at a mean concentration of 60 ng/L, was detected in primary sedimentation effluent, secondary sedimentation effluent, primary sludge, activated sludge and final sludge samples at concentrations of 35, 14, 30, 30 and 20 ng/g, respectively, in a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Thessaloniki, Greece(4).",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 39 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 17 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 44 months if adsorption is considered(4). Pentachloronitrobenzene's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Pentachloronitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

In 1977, analysis of adult total diet samples from 20 cities across the US, pentachloronitrobenzene was found in 15 out of 20 oil, fats, and shortening composite samples. Eleven of these samples contained trace amounts of pentachloronitrobenzene and the remaining 4 contained from 0.001-0.005 ppm pentachloronitrobenzene. The overall average for the 20 composites was 0.0004 ppm pentachloronitrobenzene(2). Pentachloronitrobenzene was found in 1 out of 20 sugar and adjuncts composite samples at a trace concentration(2). Pentachloronitrobenzene was also found in the oils and fats food class of infant (0.002-0.008 ppm, 0.0060 ppm avg) and toddler (0.001-0.006 ppm, 0.0025 ppm avg) total diet samples(3). Pentachloronitrobenzene has been detected in cheese, large fruits, miscellaneous processed foods, and ground grains(4). Average concn (ppm) in leaf and stem vegetables (and the fiscal year for that average) were: 0.006 (1964-69), 0.047 (1970), 0.022 (1971), 0.011 (1973), 0.003 (1974), 0.0004 (1975), 0.0005 (1976), and 0.021 (1970-76)(4). Average pentachloronitrobenzene concentrations (ppm) in various foods for the fiscal years 1970-76 were: 0.0005 in domestic processed vegetable products, 0.0009 in imported processed vegetable products, 0.0003 in domestic nuts, and 0.107 in oilseed by-products(4).

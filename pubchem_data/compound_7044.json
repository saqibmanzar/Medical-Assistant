The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Additionally, a separate group of young male F344/N rats were administered either cis- or trans-decalin iv at doses up to 20 mg/kg to assess disposition of each isomer, its metabolites, and kidney alpha2u-globulin. Decalin was eliminated from blood in a dose-dependent manner, regardless of sex, age, or species. C0 and AUC infinity increased supra-proportionally with exposure concentration. Mice were more efficient in eliminating decalin than rats at lower exposure concentrations, but nonlinear elimination kinetics were more noticeable at 400 ppm. Sex differences in blood decalin elimination were observed in rats; females had a consistently higher AUC infinity at all exposure concentrations. ...",

This epoxide has the distinction of being the first arene oxide metabolite to have been isolated. Epoxide formation is an obligatory step. The epoxide can be enzymatically converted into the dihydrodiol, 1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene or conjugated with glutathione. The dihydrodiol can then be conjugated to form a polar compound with glucuronic acid or sulfate or be further dehydrogenated to form the highly reactive 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene. This too can be enzymatically conjugated with sulfate or glucuronic acid or spontaneously oxidized to form another highly reactive compound, 1,2-naphthoquinone. /Naphthalene/",

Kidney alpha2u-globulin and decalone concentrations in old male rats were substantially lower than those in young males, but were similar to those observed in all (young and old) females. Compared to old males and all females, young male rats had significantly lower urinary decalol concentrations, but higher kidney decalin, decalone, and alpha2u-globulin concentrations. Administration of decalin to male rats as either the cis or trans isomer revealed that more cis -decalone is produced per unit dose as compared to trans-decalone, and that more trans-decalin accumulated in the kidney (as alpha2u-globulin-ligand complexes) compared to cis-decalin. These patterns of isomer-specific metabolism were also reflected in the cis/trans ratios of decalin in blood, as well as urinary decalol metabolites. The ratio of alpha2u-globulin to the total amount of decalin plus decalone measured in the male rat kidney was approximately 1.0. Therefore, alpha2u-globulin was a key factor in the accumulation of decalin and decalone in kidneys of young male rats, decalin and decalone were practically absent in all females and in old males.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Also, female rats injected ip with male rat alpha 2u-globulin exhibit increased hyaline droplet formation and alpha 2u-globulin accumulation when treated with decalin. ...",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this clear, colorless, slightly menthol-smelling liquid may occur from its use as a chemical intermediate, in the manufacture of paints, lacquers, varnishes, shoe creams, and floor waxes, rubber, asphalt, and printing inks. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, irritation of the mucous membranes, defatting dermatitis and eczema (from prolonged or repeated contact), numbness, headache, CNS depression (dizziness), vomiting, and fatal chemical pneumonitis (if the liquid is aspirated). In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and chemical protective clothing. If contact should occur, immediately flush affected eyes and skin with running water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. This material may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames. Further, its heavier than air vapor may travel to a source of ignition and flash back. Containers may explode in the heat of a fire. For fires involving decahydronaphthalene, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, fog, or standard foam. Isolate for 1/2 mile in all directions if a tank car or truck is involved in the fire. Decahydronaphthalene may be shipped domestically via air, rail, road, or water. Storage should be away from sources of ignition and oxidizing materials. Also, avoid prolonged exposure of this substance to air because of the possible formation of dangerous peroxides. Take up small spills of decahydronaphthalene with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and place into containers for later disposal. Dike far ahead of large spills to prevent decahydronaphthalene from entering confined spaces such as sewers where its vapor may create an explosion hazard. Before implementing land disposal of waste decahydronaphthalene, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

SRP: /It may be helpful to empty stomach and administer dose of activated charcoal/ Examine the plasma for evidence of hemolysis: a reddish-brown tinge. Examine the blood smear for \"ghosts\" and Heinz bodies. If /hemolysis is/ present, monitor red blood cell count and hematocrit for anemia, urine for protein, and cells. Measure direct- and indirect-reacting bilirubin in the plasma. Monitor fluid balance and blood electrolytes. If possible, monitor urinary excretion of naphthol to assess severity of poisoning and clinical progress. If hemolysis is clinically significnt, administer intravenous fluids to accelerate urinary excretion of the naphthol metabolite and protect the kidney from products of hemolysis. Use Ringer's-lactate or sodium bicarbonate to keep urine pH above 7.5. Consider use of mannitol, or furosemide, to promote diuresis. If urine flow declines, intravenous infusions must be carefully monitored to avoid fluid overload. Institute hemodialysis. Consider charcoal hemoperfusion in tandem to extract naphthalene and end-products. If anemia is severe, blood transfusions may be needed. Hydrocortisone may be of some benefit if significant hemolysis is present. /Fumigant poisoning/",

Decahydronaphthalene is a natural component of petroleum naphtha. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.30 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates decahydronaphthalene will exist primarily as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase decahydronaphthalene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 hrs. Decahydronaphthalene is not expected to undergo direct photolysis in the environment due to the lack of absorption of UV light above 290 nm. If released to soil, decahydronaphthalene is expected to have slight to no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4,600. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.47 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Decahydronaphthalene was not degraded using sediment grab samples from an oiled and pristine beach areas and mud from an intertidal zone, indicating that biodegradation may not be an important fate process in soil. If released into water, decahydronaphthalene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 hrs and 5 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 28 days if adsorption is considered. Decahydronaphthalene was not degraded using marine water but was degraded in water from a stagnant pond that had been acclimated to oil indicating that biodegradation may be an important fate process in acclimated aquatic environments. BCF's of 839-2,380 for the cis-isomer and 1,170-3,050 for the trans-isomer suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to decahydronaphthalene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where decahydronaphthalene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to decahydronaphthalene via inhalation of ambient air and air in the vicinity of kerosene space heaters, ingestion of contaminated drinking water, and thru use of consumer products containing this compound.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant estimated as 0.470 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.3 mm Hg(4), and water solubility(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 hrs and 5 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 28 days if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), BCF's of 839-2,380 for the cis-isomer and 1,170-3,050 for the trans-isomer(7), suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). That decahydronaphthalene was not degraded using marine water but was degraded in water from a stagnant pond that had been acclimated to oil(8) indicates that biodegradation may be an important fate process in acclimated aquatic environments.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 3.5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 28 days if adsorption is considered(4). Decahydronaphthalene's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of decahydronaphthalene from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 2.3 mm Hg(1).",

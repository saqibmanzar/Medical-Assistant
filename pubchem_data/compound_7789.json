PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Laboratory chow accounted for 80% of each diet. The fatty acid composition of hydrogenated castor oil that was added to the diet was as follows: 86.5% 12-hydroxystearic acid, 10.3% nonoxygenated acids, and 3.2% 12-ketostearic acid. Therefore, the actual dietary concentrations of 12-hydroxystearic acid that were fed to experimental animals were 0.87% (in 1% hydrogenated castor oil diet) and 8.7% (in 10% hydrogenated castor oil diet). At 8 weeks after the initiation of feeding, half of the groups were fed a corn oil diet for the remainder of the 16-week study. ... Lipids were extracted from adipose tissue samples and carcasses (three rats on each diet) after 8, 12, and 16 weeks The number of rats on each experimental diet that were alive at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks was 33, 30, 12, and 6 rats, respectively. The number of control rats that were alive at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks was 15, 15, 12, and 6, respectively. ... 12-Hydroxystearic acid was deposited in abdominal fat, as well as other body lipids, along with its metabolites (hydroxypalmitic acid, hydroxymyristic acid, and hydroxylauric acid). The percent composition of hydrogenated castor oil-derived hydroxy fatty acids in rat lipids was 81% 12-hydroxystearic acid, 17% 10-hydroxypalmitic acid, 1.6% 8-hydroxymyristic acid, and 0.4% 6-hydroxylauric acid. The greatest content of hydroxy acids in lipids was 4.4% in abdominal fat obtained from rats after four weeks of feeding of the 8.7% 12-hydroxystearic acid diet. This concentration decreased during the following weeks, and, at 16 weeks, was less than 2% (approximately the same concentration that was detected in carcass lipids). Hydroxy acids (as % of dry carcass weight) increased during weeks 8 to 16 in rats on both diets, 0.87% and 8.7% 12-hydroxystearic acid. After the diet for half of the experimental rats was changed to corn oil (control diet) at 8 weeks, the tissue content of hydroxy fatty acids decreased rapidly.",

The test substance was dissolved in 90% ethanol and then added to the culture medium. DNA profiles obtained from flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle showed a time- and dose-dependent accumulation of cells in the G2-M phase compared to untreated exponentially growing cells. To determine if this effect was mediated by interaction of hydroxystearic acid with cyclin-dependent kinases-cyclin complexes, histone H1 kinase activity in C 108 cell crude extracts was measured. It was determined that hydroxystearic acid inhibited histone H1 kinase activity up to 95% of that noted for mitotic cells (synchronized control C108 cells).",

ATPase activity was inhibited by rutamycin (blocks phosphorylation by ATP); this effect is expected for ATP-energized mitochondrial reactions. A small, but decided, mitochondrial volume change (swelling) was also induced by 30 pM 12-Hydroxystearic acid without the aid of ATP. This effect was inhibited by the respiratory inhibitor antimycin or dinitrophenol, but not by rutamycin; therefore, this effect was dependent on oxidative phosphorylation. 12-Hydroxystearic acid-induced mitochondrial swelling was enhanced when ATP was added to the reaction mixture. The investigators concluded that 12-Hydroxystearic acid interferes with the machinery of oxidative phosphorylation in rat liver mitochondria.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation. Dataset: the integrated content containing the transformation information. Source: the entity or group that compiled the dataset containing the transformation information.",

Alkaline hydrolysis of the lactone leads to the production of Hydroxystearic acid. Acylcyclododecanones, such as 2-hexylcyclododecanone, can be obtained by the addition of cyclododecanone at the double bond of the respective 1-alkene. This reaction occurs through a radical-chain mechanism; organic peroxides are used as initiators. The catalytic hydrogenation of castor oil to 12-Hydroxystearic acid has also been reported.",

The surfactants have a hydroxy group in the hydrophobic part, which is either free or acylated using acetyl chloride, hexanoyl chloride, or myristoyl chloride. Three of the synthesized surfactants are water-soluble and are evaluated with respect to their critical micelle concentrations and hemolytic activities. The fourth surfactant has limited water solubility and is not further included in the study. The investigated surfactants are all hemolytic close to their respective critical micelle concentration indicating that their use in parenteral formulations may be limited. Nevertheless, surfactants having the proposed structure appear as promising alternatives to existing solubilizing agents for pharmaceutical applications.",

These soft solids are generally called organogels. ...This study /examined organogel prepared/ using 12-hydroxystearic acid (12-HSA) as a gelator for soybean oil and investigated its characteristics as a controlled release formulation for lipophilic compounds. The release rate of ibuprofen, a model lipophilic compound, from organogel decreased with the increase of 12-HSA concentration in the formulation; however, the difference in the concentration of 12-HSA in the formulation did not affect the diffusivity of ibuprofen in the organogel. The erosion constant of organogel in the intestinal tract was examined by using simulated gastric fluid and intestinal fluid. Regardless of 12-HSA concentration in the formulation, organogel is very stable in the simulated gastric fluid. On the other hand, the erosion constant of organogel in the simulated intestinal fluid increased with the decreasing concentration of 12-HSA. Therefore, it is speculated that the difference in the release rate of ibuprofen among organogels with various concentrations of 12-HSA was mainly caused by the difference in the erosion rate. To characterize the organogel effect in vivo, ibuprofen was orally administered to rats in an aqueous suspension or organogel. Ibuprofen concentration in plasma rapidly increased after administration with an aqueous suspension, whereas organogel suppressed the rapid absorption. In conclusion, organogel is clearly useful as an oral controlled release formulation for lipophilic compounds.",

The four formulations were applied to the back of each subject (in vertical rows over the scapulae areas) in occlusive and semiocclusive patch tests. Prior to patch application, test sites on the back were wiped with a pad containing 70% isopropyl alcohol. Each formulation was applied to a patch by wiping the antiperspirant stick across the patch approximately five times. The quantity of test material applied per patch application (occlusive and semiocclusive) was in the range of 0.05 to 0.1 g. The semiocclusive patches were applied to the left side of the back three times, each for 48 hours (total of three 48-hour applications per test site). Occlusive patches were applied to the right side of the back (total of three 24-hours applications per test site). Both semiocclusive and occlusive patches were reinforced with strips of tape. Following patch removal, subjects were instructed to rinse the test sites with warm water. Patches were also removed by laboratory personnel, and were not reapplied to anysite that was assigned a score of 2 or greater. Test sites were evaluated for skin irritation within 24 hours after patch removal according to the following scale: 0 (no visible erythema) to 3 (severe erythema, very intense redness). Reactions to semiocclusive patches were scored on days 4, 7, and 10; occlusive patch test reactions were scored on days 4, 6, and 8. ... Semioccluded patches produced reactions in as many as nine of the subjects, whereas occluded patches produced reactions in as many as 17 individuals. Only two reactions were noted in the semioccluded patch controls and only one in the occluded patch controls. Although the formulations reportedly contained the same concentration of Hydroxystearic Acid, there were small differences in the numbers of individuals reacting to each.",

He also had a positive patch-test reaction to bis-diglyceryl polyacyladipate-2, which is present in the implicated lip balm and which itself contains 12-hydroxystearic acid. He was also incidentally found to have contact allergy to ricinoleic acid and castor oil. Ricinoleic acid is the principal fatty acid in castor oil, whereas 12-hydroxystearic acid is the principal fatty acid in hydrogenated castor oil. These two fatty acids are each 18-carbon 12-hydroxylated fatty acids, differing only in degree of saturation. The lack of patch-test reactivity to the analogous nonhydroxylated fatty acids, stearic acid (C18:0), and oleic acid (C18:1) indicates that 12-hydroxylation was required for allergenicity in this patient. In addition, serial dilution testing demonstrated that saturation of the hydroxylated C18 fatty acid enhanced its allergenicity.",

The present study ... determined the structural features of the oxidized fatty acids necessary for the stimulation of these two components of mitogenesis. Compounds were instilled intrarectally in either aqueous or mineral oil vehicles and 3 hr later (ornithine decarboxylase activity) or 12 hr later (tritiated thymidine incorporation), the animals were killed and the colonic mucosa harvested for measurement of the two parameters of cell proliferation. Hydroperoxy and hydroxy fatty acids derived from oleate and stearate were studied. Ricinoleic acid and the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone derived from oleic acid were also investigated. The minimal requirement for stimulation of cell proliferation is the presence of an oxidized functionally adjacent to a carbon-carbon double bond. All active compounds studied were roughly equipotent, which suggests a common mediator may be involved. These results imply that, in addition to biliary steroids, the autoxidation products of unsaturated fatty acids may play a role in the enhancement of tumorigenesis by high levels of dietary fat. Furthermore, the data suggest a possible mechanism of action for the active compounds. /Hydroxy fatty acid from stearate/",

The rats were divided into groups of three and fed diets containing 5, 10, and 20% hydrogenated castor oil, respectively, for 90 days. Thus, the content of 12-Hydroxystearic acid in each diet was as follows: 5% diet (4.3% 12-hydroxystearic acid), 10% diet (8.7% 12-hydroxystearic acid) and 20% diet (17.3% 12-Hydroxystearic acid). The control group was fed a commercial rat diet. At necropsy, organ weights were recorded and numerous tissues were preserved for microscopic examination. Blood samples were obtained for hematological evaluation prior to necropsy. The only abnormality noted in this study was a reduced growth rate in rats fed diets containing 8.7 and 17.3% 12-hydroxystearic acid.",

Twelve ip injections were made three times per week for four weeks, and the total dose of 12-Hydroxystearic Acid that was administered was 60 mg. At 20 weeks after the last injection, the mice were killed, the lungs were excised and fixed, and the pulmonary nodules counted.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.94X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 12-Hydroxyoctadecanoic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 900. The estimated pKa of 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid is 4.75, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 93% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The estimated pKa indicates 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 56 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid via dermal contact, primarily when using hair, skin and cosmetic products that contain this compound.

Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize(SRC). 12-Hydroxyoctadecanoic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 1.94X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5). 12-Hydroxyoctadecanoic acid degraded 93% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(6), suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

An estimated pKa of 4.75(3) indicates 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 56(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 6.41(5) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). 12-Hydroxyoctadecanoic acid degraded 93% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(6), suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

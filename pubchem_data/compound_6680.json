For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This section also includes information on whether there is a potential for the chemical to persist or degrade in the environment either through biodegradation or other processes (such as oxidation or hydrolysis) as well as the concentration or amount of the chemical found in the environment (e.g., in plants, animals as well as in the atmosphere or water).",

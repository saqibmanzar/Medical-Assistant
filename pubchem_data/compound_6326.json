When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation. Dataset: the integrated content containing the transformation information. Source: the entity or group that compiled the dataset containing the transformation information.",

This type of explosive decomposition has been experienced in a 7 mile acetylene pipeline system ... Accidental local heating to 185 \u00b0C or above of part of the wall (as little as 6 sq cm may be enough) of a cylinder containing acetylene may lead to the development of an extremely dangerous situation.

Containers, pipes, valves or fittings made of copper or copper alloys (brass, bronze) should not be used. Cylinders of dissolved acetylene should be handled carefully to prevent shocks. If a gas cylinder shows signs of internal heating the valve must be closed if possible and the cylinder liberally sprinkled using a fire extinguisher. Before any repairs or adjustments are made to containers or piping which have held acetylene, they must be well purged (with nitrogen for example) and, if necessary, completely filled with water. Dissolved acetylene should not be withdrawn from the cylinder at an hourly rate greater than a value depending on the type of the cylinder and in particular its diameter. A too fast withdrawal may carry over solvent, leaving gaseous acetylene at high pressure or may cause static electricity sparks. In installations for the manufacture or use of acetylene, safety devices must be provided to reduce pressure and flashbacks and to prevent the formation of explosive mixt. Personnel should be informed about the safety rules to be followed and not depart in any way from instructions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Acetylene forms a sensitive acetylide when passed into an aqueous solution of mercuric nitrate [Mellor 4:933. 1946-47]. It reacts with silver, copper and lead to form sensitive, explosive salts. Since acetylene is endothermic and effectively a reducing agent, its reaction with oxidants can be very violent (examples: calcium hypochlorite, nitric acid, nitrogen oxide, ozone, trifluoromethyl hypofluorite, etc.). Contact of very cold liquefied gas with water may result in vigorous or violent boiling of the product and extremely rapid vaporization, due to the large temperature differences involved. If the water is hot, there is the possibility that a liquid \"superheat\" explosion may occur. Pressures may build to dangerous levels if liquid gas contacts water in a closed container [Handling Chemicals Safely 1980]. Acetylene and ammonia can form explosive silver salts in contact with Ag.

Contact with /bleaching powder may lead to formation of explosive chloroacetylenes. Finely divided /cobalt/ metal decomposes and polymerizes acetylene on contact, becoming incandescent. Copper metal forms explosive compounds with acetylene. If warmed in air or oxygen, or on impact, copper acetylides may explode in subsequent contact with acetylene. Interaction with /halogens/ can be violent or explosive. Contact of acetylene with concentrated nitric acid in presence of mercury forms explosive trinitromethane or tetranitromethane if sulfuric acid is subsequently added. Mixture with /nitric oxide products/ will ignite at +30-50 \u00b0C. Mixtures with /oxygen/ are very explosive even at very low oxygen concentrations (<2.5%). Molten /potassium/ ignites in acetylene, then explodes. /Silver/ forms explosive compounds with acetylene. Interaction with /trifluoromethyl hypofluorite/, in absence of nitrogen as diluent, is explosive on mixing.",

While setting up an AAS instrument for use with nitrous oxide-acetylene, an explosion occurred shortly after switching from compressed air to the oxide, when the flame became unstable. This was attributed to the outdoor location of the nitrous oxide cylinder (at 5 \u00b0C) and the expansion cooling (4 \u00b0C) occurring in the reducing valve, combining to reduce the oxide flow to the point of flame instability and flashback. It was proposed that in student laboratories, air-acetylene flame sources should be replaced by air-natural gas flames to improve safety aspects with very little fall-off in detection limits in instrumental AA metal determinations. Three further incidents involving explosions in AAS installations are reported, one involved accidental contamination of the acetylene inlet line by liquid acetone from an overfilled acetylene cylinder. The other explosions involved leakage of acetylene gas inside the instrument cases and ignition by the electrical controls. Fitting of acetylene sensors inside such instruments to prevent further incidents is suggested. Acetylene gas leaking from a supply tube was ignited by the source flame and a minor explosion occurred, and appears to have damaged both gas supply lines, which led to a second major explosion and fire. This involved some 6 cu m of acetylene and 18 cu m of nitrous oxide, and caused severe structural damage.",

This resulted in an explosion, which killed three workers and seriously injured a fourth. The shed was destroyed and the nearby manufacturing building severely damaged. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) issues this Safety Bulletin to focus attention on flammable gas hazards. It recommends specific actions that companies generating acetylene, and others, should take to prevent similar incidents, which include: Maintain up-to-date operating procedures and checklists for the entire operating process. Train staff on the operating procedures and require them to demonstrate their ability to correctly follow them. Relocate drains and vents connected to flammable gas-containing equipment to safe, preferably outside, locations. Ensure that buildings and enclosures that could potentially contain acetylene meet the requirements of National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 51A. Inspect, test, and maintain check valves and block valves. Provide positive isolation on lines connected to the process to ensure that back flow of explosive gases cannot occur.",

Acetylene is released from burning wood. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.65X10+4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates acetylene will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase acetylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 days. Acetylene has a calculated global lifetimes ranging from 14 to 32 days in the atmosphere. Acetylene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, acetylene is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Acetylene will volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, acetylene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.5 hours and 2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to acetylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where acetylene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to acetylene via inhalation due to the release of this substance from combustion fuels, use of acetylene torches during welding, soldering and other metal work and through inhalation of cigarette and wood smoke.

Gas-phase acetylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.15X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Acetylene has a calculated global lifetimes ranging from 14 days(4) to 32 days(5) in the atmosphere. Acetylene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of acetylene with ozone has been estimated as 3X10-20 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 382 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). Acetylene has a calculated global lifetime of 32 days in the atmosphere(3). Acetylene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Acetylene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that acetylene is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 1.5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 2 days(SRC). Acetylene's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

Acetylene was detected with a mean concentration of 40.2 mg/cu m in urban air from Porto Alegre, Brazil, March 1996-April 16, 1997(5). An observed ambient acetylene concentration of 16 ug/cu m was reported September 8-9,1993 in California south coast air(6). Acetylene was detected in 97% of the air samples taken from Washington, DC from March 1990 to March 1991 with a mean concentration of 16.1 ppbv(7). Acetylene was detected in background, residential and street site locations in Berlin, Germany from June to August 1996 in concentrations 0.47, 1.95 and 4.79 ug/cu m, respectively(8). Acetylene is labeled as one of the most prevalent non-methane organic compounds identified in urban air(9). The compound was detected at an average concentration of 4.01 ppbv in air samples from Beijing, China, sampled from June-September, 2008(10).",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

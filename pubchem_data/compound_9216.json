The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, dibenzo-p-dioxin was not carcinogenic for Osborne-Mendel rats or B6C3Fl mice. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: Mate Rats: Negative; Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Negative; Female Mice: Negative.",

A simulation of stack emissions from municipal incinerators found dibenzo-p-dioxin was contained in the fly ash. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.12X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates that dibenzo-p-dioxin will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. However, it has been shown that dibenzo-p-dioxin can become irreversibly adsorbed to incinerator stack emissions of fly ash under certain operating conditions; therefore, particulate phase dibenzo-p-dioxin may also occur in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dibenzo-p-dioxin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.3 days. Particulate-phase dibenzo-p-dioxin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, dibenzo-p-dioxin is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 5,200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. If released into water, dibenzo-p-dioxin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Although pure culture studies have shown that dibenzo-p-dioxin can be metabolized, insufficient data are available to predict the importance of biodegradation in the environment. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9 hours and 9 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 410 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Dibenzo-p-dioxin has a strong absorption maximum at 290 nm and has the potential for direct photolysis. Exposure of pure aqueous solutions of dibenzo-p-dioxin to sunlight resulted in decompositions of up to 6% in three days of exposure. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. The general population may be exposed to dibenzo-p-dioxin via inhalation of ambient air containing dibenzo-p-dioxin. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 4.12X10-4 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 0.901 mg/l(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9 hrs and 9 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 293 days if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 410(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). Exposure of pure aqueous solutions of dibenzo-p-dioxin in pyrex tubes to outdoor October sunlight resulted in decompositions of up to 6% in three days of exposure(8); however, addition of small amounts of nitrate ion to the aqueous solutions resulted in disappearances of 70% in one day and 92% in three days(8). Although pure culture studies have shown that dibenzo-p-dioxin can be metabolized(9-12), insufficient data are available to predict the importance of biodegradation in water(SRC).",

However, it has been shown that dibenzo-p-dioxin can become irreversibly adsorbed to incinerator stack emissions of fly ash under certain operating conditions(3); therefore, particulate phase dibenzo-p-dioxin may also occur in the ambient environment(SRC). Vapor-phase dibenzo-p-dioxin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.3 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 12X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4). Particulate-phase dibenzo-p-dioxin may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Dibenzo-p-dioxin has a strong absorption maximum at 290 nm  in methanol(5) and has the potential for direct photolysis in the atmosphere(SRC).",

Dibenzo-p-dioxin is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(2). Exposure of pure aqueous solutions of dibenzo-p-dioxin in pyrex  tubes to outdoor October sunlight resulted in decompositions of up to 6% in  three days of exposure(3); however, addition of small amounts of nitrate ion  to the aqueous solutions resulted in disappearances of 70% in one day and 92%  in three days(3). Dibenzo-p-dioxin has a strong absorption maximum at 290 nm  in methanol(4) and has the potential for direct photolysis(SRC). Irradiation of a methanol solution with a UV light produced  2-hydroxydiphenyl ether and 2,2-dihydroxydiphenyl as reaction products(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Lactic acid metabolism in the presence of altered gluconeogenesis, anaerobic glycolysis, and acid-base balance is a major factor in many disorders. Lactic acid can be formed only from pyruvic acid; therefore, disorders that increase pyruvate concentration, enhance lactic acid formation, or reduce lactic acid degradation cause lactic acidosis. Inborn metabolic errors that are accompanied by derangement of metabolic pathways of glucose, pyruvate, amino acids, and organic acids as well as toxic and systemic conditions that promote tissue hypoxia or mitochondrial injury result in lactic acidosis. In the presence of acquired disorders, treatment is directed initially toward modification or cure of the primary condition and then toward eliminating acidosis and other metabolic complications. Specific therapy is available for some inborn errors of metabolism.",

To perform this function, macrophages must have the capacity to monitor the functional states of their 'client cells': namely, the parenchymal cells in the various tissues in which macrophages reside. Tumors exhibit many features of abnormally developed organs, including tissue architecture and cellular composition. Similarly to macrophages in normal tissues and organs, macrophages in tumors (tumor-associated macrophages) perform some key homeostatic functions that allow tumor maintenance and growth. However, the signals involved in communication between tumors and macrophages are poorly defined. Here we show that lactic acid produced by tumor cells, as a by-product of aerobic or anaerobic glycolysis, has a critical function in signalling, through inducing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and the M2-like polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this effect of lactic acid is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha). Finally, we show that the lactate-induced expression of arginase 1 by macrophages has an important role in tumor growth. Collectively, these findings identify a mechanism of communication between macrophages and their client cells, including tumor cells. This communication most probably evolved to promote homeostasis in normal tissues but can also be engaged in tumors to promote their growth.",

The fermentation process requires carbohydrates, nutrients, and a microorganism to produce lactic acid via fermentation. The carbohydrates used in fermentation consist predominantly of hexoses or compounds which can be easily split into hexoses, e.g., glucose, corn syrups, molasses, sugar beet juice, whey, as well as rice, wheat, corn, and potato starches. ... The nutrients required by the microorganisms include soluble peptides and amino acids, phosphates and ammonium salts, and vitamins. In many cases, the peptides and amino acids are a complex nitrogen source such as yeast extract paste, corn steep liquor, corn gluten meal, malt sprouts, soy peptone, and meat peptone. Only a minimal amount of these complex nitrogen sources are used in order to simplify purification of the lactic acid.  During fermentation, the pH of the broth must be controlled between 5.0 and 6.5. Lime (calcium hydroxide), calcium carbonate, ammonium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide are typically used to neutralize the lactic acid made in the broth to maintain constant pH. Thus, calcium lactate, ammonium lactate, or sodium lactate salts are formed in the fermentation broth. ... Lactic acid yields are between 85 and 95% based on fermentable sugars. Typical fermentation byproducts, such as formic acid and acetic acid, are found in concentrations of less than 0.5 wt%. \"Homofermentive\" bacterial strains are typically used as they produce the least amount of byproducts. ... After fermentation, the lactic acid broth needs to be purified for its intended use.",

It involves base-catalyzed addition of hydrogen cyanide to acetaldehyde to produce lactonitrile. This is a liquid-phase reaction and occurs at atmospheric pressures. The crude lactonitrile is then recovered and purified by distillation and is hydrolyzed to lactic acid using either concentrated hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, producing the corresponding ammonium salt as a by-product. This crude lactic acid is esterified with methanol, producing methyl lactate. The latter is recovered and purified by distillation and hydrolyzed by water under acid catalysts to produce lactic acid, which is further concentrated, purified, and shipped under different product classifications, and methanol, which is recycled",

When fermentation is complete, as indicated by failure of the liquid to give a test for glucose, the solution is filtered, concentrated, and allowed to stand. The calcium lactate that crystallizes is decomposed with dilute sulfuric acid and filtered with charcoal. The lactic acid in the filtrate is extracted with ethyl or isopropyl ether, the ether is distilled off, and the aqueous solution of the acid is concentrated under reduced pressure.",

The benefits or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Carboxylic acids with six or fewer carbon atoms are freely or moderately soluble in water; those with more than six carbons are slightly soluble in water. Soluble carboxylic acid dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Many insoluble carboxylic acids react rapidly with aqueous solutions containing a chemical base and dissolve as the neutralization generates a soluble salt. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Insoluble carboxylic acids react with solutions of cyanides to cause the release of gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymerization reactions; like other acids, they often catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions. Slowly corrodes most metals (USCG, 1999).",

It has multiple uses in dyeing baths, as mordant in printing woolen goods, solvent for water-insoluble dyes. It is also used for reducing chromates in mordanting wool, in manufacture of cheese, confectionery. Lactic acid is a component of  babies' milk formulas; acidulant in beverages; also used for acidulating worts in brewing. It is used in prepn of sodium lactate injections, and as ingredient of cosmetics, component of spermatocidal jellies. Other uses: for removing Clostridium butyricum in manufacture of yeast; dehairing, plumping, and decalcifying hides, solvent for cellulose formate, flux for soft solder. Lactic acid is used to manufacture lactates which are used in food products, in medicine, and as solvents. It is also a plasticizer, catalyst in the casting of phenolaldehyde resins. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Its effect on eye is similar to that of other acid of moderate strength, causing initial epithelial coagulation on cornea and conjunctiva, but having good prognosis if promptly washed off with water. In man, accidental intraduodenal administration of 100 mL 33% lactic acid was fatal within 12 hours. Hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis are among the most dangerous and life-threatening side effect that occurs during therapy with some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Lactic acidosis is associated with both inherited and acquired metabolic diseases. Lactic acid metabolism in the presence of altered gluconeogenesis, anaerobic glycolysis, and acid-base balance is a major factor in many disorders. Lactic acid can be formed only from pyruvic acid; therefore, disorders that increase pyruvate concentration, enhance lactic acid formation, or reduce lactic acid degradation cause lactic acidosis. Inborn metabolic errors that are accompanied by derangement of metabolic pathways of glucose, pyruvate, amino acids, and organic acids as well as toxic and systemic conditions that promote tissue hypoxia or mitochondrial injury result in lactic acidosis. ANIMAL STUDIES: Applied to rabbit eyes in a standard manner, the reaction at twenty-four hours has been graded 8 on scale of 1 to 10. If allowed to remain on rabbit eyes, both the full strength acid and a 50% solution in water have caused corneal necrosis and persistent stromal scarring. Groups of male rats, five per group, were dosed with 0.5 mL of 130, 650, or 1300 mg/2000 kg body wt lactic acid via stomach tube; the control group received the same volume of water. Two rats of the 650-mg group and one rat of the 1300-mg group died within 24 hr of dosing. The rats were dosed with the same amounts of lactic acid after 8 days. Two rats of the 1300 mg group died; dyspnea, snivel, vomiting, and abdominal inflation were observed in these animals immediately after dosing. No overt toxic effects were observed in pigs given approximately 3.6-18 g/kg lactic acid in feed or water for up to 5 months. Drunken lamb syndrome has been described as lamb D-lactic acidosis syndrome. In developmental study, twelve mice were dosed daily with 570 mg/kg lactic acid by gavage on days 6 to 15 of gestation; a control group of 13 mice received distilled water. All dams were killed on day 18 of gestation. No significant difference was observed in gestational body weight gain between test and control animals, but feed consumption was significantly decreased as compared to control values. Also, relative maternal liver weight was significantly decreased as compared to controls. The only observed effect on the fetus was a statistically significant increase in delayed ossification of the parietal bones. Female rabbits were dosed orally with 0.1 - 0.2 g/kg lactic acid in 100 -150 mL water twice daily for 5 months, and five female rabbits were dosed orally with 0.1 - 0.7 g/kg lactic acid in 50 - 100 mL water twice daily for 16 months (13 months actual treatment). No tumors were reported after 5 or 16 months, respectively. Negative results were obtained when the mutagenic potential of lactic acid, 90.5% pure, in phosphate buffer was assayed in an Ames test using S. typhimurium strains TA92, TA1535, TA100, TA1537, TA94, and TA98 with metabolic activation. Negative results were obtained in an Ames test for 1000 ug/mL 11 mM lactic acid using a clonal subline of Chinese hamster fibroblasts derived from lung tissue in the absence of metabolic activation. Lactic acid was negative for chromosomal aberrations. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Feeding of 10% lactic acid to birds has been blamed for the development of polyneuritic crises resembling B1 deficiency on diets rich in carbohydrates, proteins or fats.",

We randomly divided 108 rats into 6 groups: sham, reperfusion injury, postconditioning (Post), lacticacid (Lac), low-dose edaravone (Eda), and lactic acid + low-dose edaravone (Lac+Eda). The left coronary arteries of the rats were occluded for 45 minutes, before the administration of the treatments. The rats were euthanized at different time points to examine the infarct size and serum markers of myocardial injury and apoptosis and measure the expression of signal pathway markers. We found that the infarct areas caused by ischemic-reperfusion injury were reduced largely by postconditioning and Lac+Eda injection; a similar trend was observed for serum markers of myocardial injury, apoptosis, and hemodynamic parameters. Compared with the Post group, the Lac+Eda group had similar blood pH values, levels of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial absorbance, and levels of signal pathway marker. The Lac and Eda groups partly mimicked the protective role. These data suggest that local myocardial administration of lactic acid and low dose of edaravone initiates protective signal pathways of mechanical postconditioning and replicates the myocardial protection.",

This study investigated upwind responses of Anopheles stephensi, mysorensis form, an important malaria vector in Asia, to carbon dioxide and L-lactic acid under laboratory conditions. While a minimal dose of carbon dioxide (90 ppm) activated the mosquitoes, 10 times this amount suppressed them. L-lactic acid alone did not produce a significant effect by itself, but addition of 6 ug/min of L-lactic acid to a range of 90 to 410 ppm carbon dioxide resulted in attraction. The results provide further support for the hypothesis that CO2 plays an important role in the host-seeking behavior of zoophilic mosquitoes, and suggests that L-lactic acid might play a more critical role than CO2 in the attraction of An. stephensi.",

The mean rating of burning/stinging reported for lactic acid cream 10% with strontium and cetearyl alcohol lotion was lower than ammonium lactate lotion 12% (P<.0001).

The most rational therapy for these patients, the sodium bicarbonate administration, cannot prevent those accompanying deficiencies and may actually be harmful. In addition, tromethamine adjusts the blood pH, it does not affect the lactate accumulation. Therefore, discovery of a therapeutic agent is still a major unsolved problem. In this study, the rats were divided into different groups and lactic acidosis type B was induced in them. Then, the effect of different injection doses of spermidine (0-20 nmol) on lactic acidosis was analyzed by measuring the lactate level and pH in the rat blood samples. The results showed that spermidine effectively and simultaneously inhibited the lactate and pyruvate accumulations, and also adjusted the pH of bloodstream. On the other hand, it has been shown that spermidine increases the activity of phosphatase, leading to prevention of lactate accumulation. The results indicate that administration of only nanomole level of spermidine may be the best treatment in the liver transplant and other patients suffering from lactic acidosis type B.",

On withdrawing lactic acid from the diet the level of lactic acid excreted in the urine returned to normal. Since the racemic mixture used consisted of 80% of the L(+) and 20% of the D(-) forms it seems that the metabolism of the D(-) form by the young full-term baby is more difficult than the L(+) form. The increase in the urinary excretion of either form of lactic acid indicated that the young infant cannot utilize lactic acid at a rate which can keep up with 0.35% in the diet. A number of babies could not tolerate lactic acid. In such cases there was rapid loss of weight, frequent diarrhoea, reduction of plasma bicarbonate and increased excretion of organic acids in the urine. All these effects were reversed on withdrawing lactic acid from the diet",

The undiluted test materials and the positive control, 8-methoxypsoralen (1/128% in ethanol), were applied to the shaved left side of the back and allowed to penetrate for 30 min; one application/animal was made in all tests except one (test 3) in which two applications/animal were made. The backs of the animals were irradiated with a UV light source (FL40-BL, >320 nm) placed 8 inches above the midline. In tests 1 and 4, there was one 1-hr irradiation period; in test 2, there was one 1-hr and one 2-hr irradiation period; and in tests 3 and 5, there was one 2-hr irradiation period. Following irradiation, the test materials were applied to the shaved right side of the back in the same manner. Test sites were scored using the Draize scale for erythema and edema at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr after application. Upon examination of all results, it was concluded that the face cream containing 0.25% of 85% aq. lactic acid was a \"weak phototoxin.\"",

Lactic acid is a principal metabolic intermediate in most living organisms and also occurs in sour milk, foods, and some higher plants. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.0813 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates lactic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase lactic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.7 days. Lactic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, lactic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon experimental Koc values ranging from <0.08 to <20.9. The pKa of lactic acid is 3.86, indicating that this compound will exist partially to almost entirely as an anion in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.6X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Lactic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 76% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, lactic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Various screening tests have found lactic acid to biodegrade readily. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to lactic acid may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where lactic acid is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to lactic acid via ingestion of food and drinking water and dermal contact with consumer products containing lactic acid. (SRC)",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2.7 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solutions at pH 1 is 4.8X10+8 L/mol-sec(2); this corresponds to an aquatic half-life of about 4.6 years at an aquatic concentration of 1X10-17 hydroxyl radicals per liter(3). Lactic acid is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Laboratory studies found aqueous solutions of lactic acid to be very stable with an estimated shelf-life of 70 years(5). Lactic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Nine postpartum women exercised on a treadmill up to maximal oxygen uptake (100% of VO2max) on the first laboratory visit, for 30 minutes on two subsequent occasions (50% and 75% of VO2max) and also performed a nonexercise control session. Blood and breast milk were collected prior to exercise, immediately after exercise, and at 30, 60, and 90 minutes postexercise. Blood samples were analyzed for lactic acid (LA) while milk samples were analyzed for LA, pH, lipid, ammonium, and urea. Milk LA after the 100% intensity session was significantly elevated through 90 minutes postexercise, while there was no significant increase in milk LA at any collection time after the 50% or 75% intensity sessions. There were no significant differences in milk pH, lipid, ammonium, or urea measurements after any of the exercise sessions. These data show that unlike maximum intensity exercise, moderate intensity exercise does not increase breast milk LA content.",

Twenty-six lactating postpartum women exercised to maximum (maximum oxygen consumption = 35.1 +/- 9.2 [SD] mL min-1 kg-1) on a treadmill. Breast milk was collected via self-expression at rest before exercise and at 10 and 30 minutes postexercise and analyzed for lactic acid by enzymatic methods. Following exercise, infants were presented with their mothers' pre-exercise and postexercise milk in a double-blind design. The mother rated the infant's acceptance of the milk samples. There was a significant difference in acceptance of pre-exercise and postexercise milk as analyzed by analysis of variance. Maximal exercise resulted in a significant increase in lactic acid concentration in breast milk that may be high enough to affect the taste of the milk. The decreased acceptance of postexercise milk was associated with increased lactic acid concentration. Suggestions to circumvent the decreased acceptance are offered.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Combining the two chlorinators at 2, 6, 12, or 18 g of each produced a progressive increase in gas production from 234 to 1422 mL. The temperature increased from 30 degrees C at 2 g to 63 degrees C at 18 g. The time to complete the reaction decreased from 6.2 minutes at 2 g to 3.8 minutes at 18 g. The third run at the 18 g level resulted in an explosion. The results indicate that gas generation is dependent on both products.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Personal breathing zone sampling and medical interviews were performed. Particulate concentrations ranged from 0.11 to 38 mg/cu m. About 60% of the dust near the packaging areas was within the respirable size range. No OSHA standards for exposure to any chlorinated isocyanurates have been developed. Workers used respirator facepieces with high efficiency particulate filters. All production workers reported one or more work related symptoms. The most common symptoms were eye irritation and cough. 78% of the women interviewed reported problems or changes in their menstrual cycle since beginning work in the packaging area.",

Three groups of mice, each consisting of 25 males and 25 females, received the test article at dosage levels of 896, 1792, and 5375 ppm NaCy respectively. A fourth group with the same number of animals received sodium hippurate (NaHip) at a dosage of 7769 ppm (which provided the same level of sodium as the high (5375 ppm) dose of NaCy). A fifth group, also with 25 animals of each sex, received only tap water and served as the untreated control. After 6 wk of treatment, five animals of each sex were sacrificed. Criteria evaluated for compound related effects included: survival, clinical observations, bw gains, food and water consumption, clinical pathology, absolute and relative organ wt, and gross and microscopic pathology. Consistently high water consumption was noted in the high dose (5375 ppm NaCy) males and females ... No other compound related effects were noted in this study during the in-life phase. Dose-related increases in absolute and relative ovarian wt were noted after 13 wk of treatment. This difference was significant for the high dose group (5375 ppm NaCy) and for the sodium control group (7769 ppm NaHip). Since this finding was significant for both of these groups, this finding may be related to increased sodium intake. Microscopic evaluation of tissues taken after 6 wk of treatment did not reveal any treatment related changes. In the tissues examined after 13 wk of treatment, no test article related histomorphologic alterations were noted, with the exception of changes in the urinary bladder resulting from the presence of calculi in two males from the high dose group (5375 ppm NaCy). A variety of spontaneous disease lesions and incidental findings were noted with essentially comparable incidence and severity in the control and in the treated groups without relationship to treatment. /Monosodium cyanurate/",

The 24-hr median lethal concentration (LC50) values for these biocides with respect to 24-, 48-, and 72-hr-old Artemia, determined by static bioassays, showed the following rank order of toxicity: THPC < TCIC < NaBr. An age-dependent increase in sensitivity was seen for each compound. All three biocides reduced the phototactic response of 24-hr-old Artemia larvae in 24-hr static bioassays; the median inhibitory concentration ratios obtained were 30 to 40 times lower than their respective 24-hr LC50 values. The results suggest that phototaxis bioassays could provide the speed and simplicity required for screening many potential pollutants for harmful effects. The bioconcentration factors obtained for Artemia larvae exposed to 10% LC50 for 168 hr in renewal assays were 93.75, 1.67, and 0.23 for THPC, TCIC, and NaBr, respectively. This shows these biocides pose no bioaccumulation risk in this organism, although the value of 93.75 obtained for THPC is close to the threshold above which such a risk is considered to exist.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.6X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates trichloroisocyanuric acid will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase trichloroisocyanuric acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Trichloroisocyanuric acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, trichloroisocyanuric acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 25. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.2X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Trichloroisocyanuric acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data for trichloroisocyanuric acid in the terrestrial environment were not available. If released into water, trichloroisocyanuric acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, trichloroisocyanuric acid reacted with water to form isocyanuric acid, which is confirmed to be biodegradable. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound contains functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to trichloroisocyanuric acid may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where trichloroisocyanuric acid is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to trichloroisocyanuric acid via dermal contact with consumer products containing trichloroisocyanuric acid. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.2X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3.1(SRC), from its water solublity(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Trichloroisocyanuric acid is expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment since this compound contains functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Biodegradation data for trichloroisocyanuric acid in the aquatic environment were not available(SRC,2009). However, in the Japanese MITI test, trichloroisocyanuric acid reacted with water to form isocyanuric acid, which is confirmed to be biodegradable(8).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

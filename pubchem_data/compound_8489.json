When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Urine was collected over 24-hr periods until metabolites were no longer excreted (usually after 48 hr). The main metabolic processes were reduction and hydroxylation. For each isomer, nearly the entire dose was excreted in urine as the chloroaniline or derivatives of phenolic metabolites. For all three isomers, about 10% of the administered dose was excreted as chloroaniline. The phenols formed were excreted mainly as conjugates with sulfuric and glucuronic acids (66% of the administered dose for 2-chloronitrobenzene, 51% for 3-chloronitrobenzene and 40% for 4-chloronitrobenzene).",

It is also produced as a minor by-product during the production of o- and p-chloronitrobenzenes which are used in the manufacture of dyes. 1-Chloro-3-nitrobenzene can also enter the environment through the chlorination of drinking water and sewage effluent if nitrobenzene is present. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.097 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 134 days. 1-Chloro-3-nitrobenzene was shown to undergo photolysis in pure water and river water when exposed to natural outdoor sunlight, suggesting photolysis in air is possible. If released to soil, 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene is expected to have moderate mobility in soil based on an estimated Koc value of 310. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur given a Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Chloro-3-nitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The biodegradation half-life of 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene was >64 days in solutions using microorganisms derived from a soil inoculum. If released into water, 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 56 hours and 30 days, respectively. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Biodegradation may occur quickly under anoxic conditions based on a biodegradation half-life of 3.2 days in anaerobic estuarine sediment. 1-Chloro-3-nitrobenzene was shown to undergo photolysis in pure water and river water when exposed to natural outdoor sunlight, suggesting photolysis in sunlit surface water is possible. BCF values of 77-91 measured in fish, suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene or other nitrobenzene isomers are produced or used. (SRC)",

According to a classification scheme(5), BCF values of 77-91 measured in fish(6), suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Screening tests using river water(7) suggest biodegradation of 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene proceeds slowly under aerobic conditions in water. Degradation may proceed more quickly under anaerobic conditions given a biodegradation half-life of 3.2 days in anaerobic estuarine sediment(8). 1-Chloro-3-nitrobenzene was shown to undergo photolysis in pure water and river water when exposed to natural outdoor sunlight(9), suggesting photolysis in sunlit surface water is possible(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

A lack of significant ring cleavage by day 64, as measured by UV spectroscopy, showed that 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene at 10 ug/mL did not degrade readily in aqueous suspensions of Niagara silt loam(2). This analytical method was not selective enough however, to determine whether biotransformations not involving aromatic ring cleavage may have taken place(2). Information from studies to determine the effectiveness of various drinking water purification methods in the Netherlands suggests that 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene may be biodegraded in soil(3). The removal of 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene from bank-filtered water that was observed in these studies, may have been due partly to biodegradation; however, the contribution of other processes such as adsorption was not determined. In an earlier study, 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene was measured in bank-filtered Rhine River water retained for a time of >1 year(4).  The biodegradation half-life of 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene was >64 days in solutions using microorganisms derived from a soil inoculum(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 134 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 1-Chloro-3-nitrobenzene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). The irradiation of 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene from 1 to 5 hours using a xenon arc lamp in air free from nitrogen oxides resulted in the formation of 3-chloro-2-nitrophenol, 3-chloro-6-nitrophenol, and 3-chloro-4-nitrophenol(3). 89% of 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene irradiated in air in a quartz vessel disappeared with 3.6% of the reaction product as 3-chloro-2-nitrophenol, 1.1% as 3-chloro-6-nitrophenol, and 23% as 3-chloro-4-nitrophenol(3). The irradiation of 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene in nitrogen without nitrogen oxides present resulted in m-chlorophenol formation(3). In a quartz vessel, 98% of the 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene disappeared with 12% of the reaction product appearing as m-chlorophenol(3). 1-Chloro-3-nitrobenzene was shown to undergo photolysis in pure water and river water when exposed to natural outdoor sunlight(4).",

Under reducing conditions and in the presence of natural organic matter (66 mg C/L in aqueous solution, 5 mM H2S, Eh<-0.2 V) 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene is reduced abiotically mainly to 3-chlorophenylhydroxylamine and 3-chloroaniline. Using NOM from bog water from Hyde County NC, the 2nd order, carbon normalized rate constants for solutions containing 80 uM 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene were recorded as 8X10-5 L/hr-mg C at pH 5.5, 8.1X10-4 L/hr-mg C at pH 7.2 and 2.2X10-3 L/hr-mg C at pH 8.6(1). The results from this study demonstrate that natural organic matter mediates the reduction of substituted nitroaromatic compounds in reducing environments. It is suggested that quinone-type species play a predominant role in natural organic matter mediated reductions of 1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene(1). Quinoid-type compounds and iron porphyrins were shown to be effective mediators for the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds, including chloronitrobenzenes(2). Reaction conditions are homogeneous aqueous solutions (pH 6.8-7.0, 5 mM H2S) containing reduced sulfur species as bulk electron donors(2). Therefore, the reduction of chloronitrobenzenes in the environment may occur under reducing conditions in the presence of electron transfer mediators(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

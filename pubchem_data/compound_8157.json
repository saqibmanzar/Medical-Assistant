PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Based on a scenario where the chemical is spilled into an excess of water (at least 5 fold excess of water), half of the maximum theoretical yield of Hydrogen Chloride gas will be created in 2.8 minutes. After mixing particular chemicals into water, there may be a delay of 1-10 minutes before gas generation may be observed. For this chemical, a 420 second induction time was observed.

If the eyes have come in contact with dimethyldichlorosilane, irritation, pain, swelling, corneal erosion, and blindness may result. Dermatitis (red, inflamed skin), severe burns, pain, and shock generally follow dermal exposure. Inhalation irritates mucous membranes. Severe gastrointestinal damage may occur. Vapors cause severe eye and lung injury. Upon short contact, second and third degree burns may occur. Signs and symptoms of acute ingestion of dimethyldichlorosilane may be severe and include increased salivation, intense thirst, difficulty swallowing, chills, pain, and shock.

These data suggest that the acute toxicity of chlorosilanes is due to the hydrogen chloride hydrolysis product; acute toxicity of the chlorosilanes is both qualitatively (based on clinical signs) and quantitatively (based on molar equivalents of hydrogen chloride) similar to that of HCl. Complete hydrolysis of one mole of a monochlorosilane would yield a maximum of one mole of hydrogen chloride. Complete hydrolysis of a dichlorosilane would yield a maximum of two moles of hydrogen chloride, complete hydrolysis of a trichlorosilane would yield a maximum of three moles of hydrogen chloride, and complete hydrolysis of tetrachlorosilane would yield a maximum of four moles of hydrogen chloride. /Chorosilanes/",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

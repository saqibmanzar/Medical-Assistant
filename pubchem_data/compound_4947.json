Indirect food additive arising from paper or board packaging, adhesives and food contact polymers Propyl gallate is an anti-oxidant. It protects against oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and oxygen free radicals, in a catalytic manner similar to superoxide dismutase. Propyl gallate, or propyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate is an ester formed by the condensation of gallic acid and propanol. It is an antioxidant added to foods containing oils and fats to prevent oxidation.[citation needed] As a food additive, it is used under the E number E310.\n\nPropyl gallate has been shown to exhibit pro-oxidant and radical scavenger functions (A7908, A7909).",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

One mechanism of protection against phosgene-induced lung injury may involve the use of antioxidants. The present study focused on dietary supplementation in mice using n-propyl gallate (nPG)--a gallate acid ester compound used in food preservation--and vitamin E. Five groups of male mice were studied: group 1, control-fed with Purina rodent chow 5002; group 2, fed 0.75% nPG (w/w) in 5002; group 3, fed 1.5% nPG (w/w) in 5002; group 4 fed 1% (w/w) vitamin E in 5002; and group 5, fed 2% (w/w) vitamin E also in 5002. Mice were fed for 23 days. On day 23 mice were exposed to 32 mg m-3 (8 ppm) phosgene for 20 min (640 mg. min m-3) in a whole-body exposure chamber. Survival rates were determined at 12 and 24 hr. In mice that died within 12 h, the lungs were removed and lung wet weights, dry weights, wet/dry weight ratios, lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) and glutathione (GSH) were assessed. Vitamin E had no positive effect on any outcome measured. There was no significant difference between 1.5% nPG and any parameter measured or survival rate compared with 5002 + phosgene. However, dietary treatment with 0.75% nPG significantly increased survival rate (p </= 0.002) and lowered TBARS (p </= 0.05) compared with 5002 + phosgene at 12 hr after exposure. Mice fed 0.75% nPG had a lower wet/dry wt ratio compared with those fed 1.5% nPG and a significantly increased lung tissue GSH 36%, compared with the 5002 + phosgene group. In conclusion, dietary treatment with a low level of the antioxidant nPG protected mice by decreasing lipid peroxidation and increasing lung tissue GSH. The higher level of nPG and both levels of vitamin E diets were ineffective, suggesting that a ceiling threshold level of antioxidants in lung tissue is required for survival against phosgene-induced lung injury.",

In the present study we explored the role of oxidants present in ambient particles in causing damage to the mucociliary epithelium. We explored the protective effects of pretreatment with three substances (n-propyl gallate, DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate, and EDTA) on the frog palate exposed to residual oil fly ash (ROFA). The parameters analyzed were mucociliary transport (MCT) and ciliary beating frequency (CBF) after 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 120 min of exposure. MCT was decreased significantly by ROFA (p<0.001), with a significant interaction effect (p=0.02) between the duration of exposure and treatment with antioxidants. The inhibitory effects on MCT of the substances tested were significantly different (p=0.002); vitamin E was similar to control (Ringer) and different from all other groups. CBF showed no significant effect of duration of exposure (p=0.465), but a significant interaction between duration of exposure and treatments was observed (p=0.011). Significant differences were detected among treatments (p<0.001), with ROFA and n-propyl gallate at concentrations of 50 uM presenting a short-lived increase in CBF, which was not observed in the remaining groups. The results showed that both MCT and CBF were affected within a short period (100 min) of exposure to ROFA and that the presence of antioxidant substances, such as vitamin E (4 mg/mL) and n-propyl gallate (300 uM), protected against the mucociliary impairment induced by ROFA on the frog palate.",

To find a novel Ca(2+) sensitizer, we have screened a group of phenolic compounds by examining their effects on the Ca(2+)-dependent force generation in cardiac muscle fibers. We found that propyl gallate, a strong antioxidant, increased the Ca(2+) sensitivity of cardiac myofilament in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. The present study indicates that propyl gallate is a novel type of Ca(2+) sensitizer with antioxidant activity, which might be more beneficial for the treatment of congestive heart failure associated with oxidative stress than existing Ca(2+) sensitizers.",

All test substances were extensively metabolized by the homogenate of the intestinal mucosa. ... Furthermore, the caecum and colon contents also showed a high metabolic capacity, especially towards propyl gallate. The amt of gallic acid detected in the incubations was always much smaller than the total decrease of the amt of ester.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It suppressed production of nitric oxide and induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It was able to diminish reactive oxygen species level elevated in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It also suppressed gelatinolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 enhanced in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It inhibited inhibitory kappaB-aplha degradation and enhanced NF-kappaB promoter activity in the stimulated macrophage cells. It was able to suppress phosphorylation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) and activation of c-Jun promoter activity in the stimulated macrophage cells. In brief, n-propyl gallate possesses anti-inflammatory activity via down-regulation of NF-kappaB and JNK pathways.",

PG activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), inhibited nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and induced intracellular glutathione (GSH) depletion. In addition, PG increased superoxide dismutase-1 expression and decreased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species.

The determination of these compounds involves two different and independent reactions. On the one hand, PG determination is based on an energy transfer process that involves the formation of a lanthanide chelate with terbium in the presence of Triton X-100 and tri-n-octylphosphine oxide. On the other hand, BHA is determined using a reaction between the oxidized form of Nile Blue and the antioxidant. Both systems are excited at the same excitation wavelength (310 nm), and the emission wavelengths are 545 and 665 nm for PG and BHA, respectively. The absence of overlap in the emission spectra makes it possible to measure separately the analytes in each channel of the instrument. Initial rate and equilibrium signal are used as analytical parameters and measured in 0.1 and 1 s for PG and BHA, respectively. Calibration graphs are linear over the range 0.09-3.5 ug/mL for PG and 0.3-15 ug/mL for BHA. The relative standard deviations of both systems are close to 2%. The proposed method is applied to the determination of these two antioxidants in several commercial food samples with recoveries ranging between 94.8 and 102.9% for PG and between 94.1 and 102.1% for BHA.",

The methods are based on the transient retention behavior of these compounds in a flow-through cell packed with C-18 silica using ethanol-water mixtures as a carrier, and on the intrinsic absorbance monitored at 290 and 283 nm, respectively. After recording the analytical signal, the antioxidants were easily and quickly desorbed from the solid support by the same carrier. For BHA, calibration graphs were linear over the range 1.0-300.0 mg/L using area as the analytical parameter. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was between 0.5 and 1.6%. For n-PG, calibration graphs were linear over the range 1.0-300.0 mg/L in area and the RSD was between 1.4 and 1.5%. The methods were applied to the determination of these antioxidants in several food and cosmetics samples, and were validated using the standard additions method and an HPLC reference method.",

The antioxidants in edible oil were isolated directly with acetonitrile saturated with n-hexane. The antioxidants in food were extracted with ethyl acetate and the extract was concentrated under vacuum. They were isolated from the residue with acetonitrile saturated with n-hexane. The acetonitrile layer was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min. The HPLC separation was performed on a Symmetry C18 column (3.5 microns, 4.6 mm i.d. x 150 mm) using a mixture of 5% acetic acid-acetonitrile-methanol (4:3:3, v/v/v) as the mobile phase and monitored by using a fluorescence detector with time programming. Sample peaks were identified by comparison of the fluorescence spectra with those of antioxidant standards. Average recoveries of fortified antioxidants at 100 micrograms/g were 72.1-99.6%. Coefficients of variation were 0.7-7.2%.",

It is used as an antioxidant for foods and cosmetics; especially fats, oils, emulsions, and waxes. It is used in transformer oils and as a stabilizer for synthetic vitamin A. It is also used as experimental medication. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Statistically significant increase in propyl gallate-positive rates on patch testing over the last decade have been reported. Propyl gallate produced contact dermatitis in 5 of 10 patients. Patients applied 20% in 70% ethyl alcohol to forearm daily for 24 days. 5 patients complained of pruritus and erythema. Propyl gallate was investigated in vitro at concentration of 0.5, 5.0 and 50 ug/mL employing WI-38 human embryonic lung cells for anaphase abnormalities. Propyl gallate was not mutagenic. ANIMAL STUDIES: In a 4-week oral toxicity study, rats ingested 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, or 2.5% propyl gallate in feed. In rats ingesting the highest dose, a decrease in weight gain of more than 10%, dirty tails, thickening of the stomach wall, necrosis, and ulceration of the stomach mucosa, a moderate to severe granulomatous inflammatory response in the submucosa and muscular wall of the stomach, anemia, hyperplastic tubuli in the outer medulla of the kidneys, and increased activity of several microsomal and cytoplasmic drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver were observed. Increased activity of hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes was also noted in rats treated with 0.5% propyl gallate. No effects were noted in those ingesting 0.1%. Guinea pigs fed 0.02% propyl gallate in the diet for 14 months and dogs fed 0.01% for a year showed no signs of toxicity. Administration to rats of 2.5% propyl gallate in the diet caused maternal toxicity and slight retardation of fetal development, but no teratogenic effects. In dose levels up to 250 mg/kg/day, propyl gallate had no effects on organogenesis in rabbits. At a concentration of 0-0.1 mg/plate, propyl gallate was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strain TA102, in the presence, but not the absence, of metabolic activation. An intraperitoneal injection of 900 mg/kg propyl gallate caused a positive result in a mouse micronucleus test. Propyl gallate was found to be negative when tested for mutagenicity using the Salmonella/microsome preincubation assay with 5 Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA97, TA98, and TA100) in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: The toxic effects of propyl gallate on aquatic organisms were investigated, using five model systems from four trophic levels. The most sensitive system was the hepatoma fish cell line PLHC-1 according to total protein content, with an EC(50) of 10 uM and a NOAEL of 1 uM at 72 hours, followed by the immobilization of Daphnia magna, the inhibition of bioluminescence of Vibrio fischeri, the salmonid fish cell line RTG-2 and the inhibition of the growth of Chlorella vulgaris.",

This was measured by the thiobarbituric acid assay (TBA assay) and by detection of accumulating fluorescent products after a 1-hr treatment of cells with CuCl2/PG at concentrations higher than 0.125 mM. PG alone led to a significant reduction of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) demonstrating its antioxidative properties. Time course studies of lipid peroxidation by PG/Cu(II) showed that formation of TBARS was preceded by a lag phase of 60 min. Thereafter, the TBARS value increased rapidly for 1 hr and then reached a constant maximum or slightly decreased. The induction of lipid peroxidation by PG/Cu(II) is probably due to the formation of reactive species like reactive oxygen species (ROS), Cu(I) and semiquinone radicals which are able to participate in initiation and propagation of lipid peroxidation. Combination effects of PG/Cu(II) were demonstrated also on inhibition of membrane-bound succinate dehydrogenase. Cytosolic esterases were affected only slightly. The greater susceptibility of membrane-bound enzymes is in accordance with the lipid peroxidation-inducing effects of PG/Cu(II).",

The objectives were to assess the prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis to propyl gallate in our center from 1988 to 2005. From 1988 to 2005, 9529 patients were patch tested to the face series, 6973 were females and 2556 were males. Patch tests were read at 2 D and 4 D. Positive reactions were scored as per International Contact Dermatitis Research Group recommendations as negative, +, ++, and +++ reactions. Propyl gallate was used at a 1% petrolatum (pet.). A total of 55 patients had positive reactions to propyl gallate 1% pet. (0.57%), 46 were female (0.65%) and 9 were male (0.33%). Using chi-square, there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in the positivity rates between the 1988-96 period (0.45%) and the 1997-2005 period (0.77%). A review of our face series performed in the last 18 years has shown a statistically significant increase in propyl gallate-positive rates on patch testing over the last decade. An increase in its use in the cosmetic industry may well be the explanation for this. Nevertheless, a concomitant reduction of propyl gallate as an antioxidant in food, with oral tolerance being less likely to develop, may also be a contributing factor in the increasing trend of allergic contact dermatitis caused by propyl gallate.",

The toxic effects /of propyl gallate on aquatic organisms/ were investigated, using five model systems from four trophic levels. The most sensitive system was the hepatoma fish cell line PLHC-1 according to total protein content, with an EC(50) of 10 uM and a NOAEL of 1 uM at 72 hr, followed by the immobilization of Daphnia magna, the inhibition of bioluminescence of Vibrio fischeri, the salmonid fish cell line RTG-2 and the inhibition of the growth of Chlorella vulgaris. Although protein content, neutral red uptake, methylthiazol metabolization and acetylcholinesterase activity were reduced in PLHC-1 cells, stimulations were observed for lysosomal function, succinate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activities. No changes were observed in metallothionein levels. The main morphological observations were the loss of cells and the induction of cell death mainly by necrosis but also by apoptosis. The protective and toxic effects of propyl gallate were evaluated. General antioxidants and calcium chelators did not modify the toxicity of propyl gallate, but an iron-dependent lipid peroxidation inhibitor gave 22% protection. The results also suggest that propyl gallate cytotoxicity is dependent on glutathione levels, which were modulated by malic acid diethyl ester and 2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid. According to the results, propyl gallate should be classified as toxic to aquatic organisms.",

Propyl gallate's use as an antioxidant in pesticide formulations will result in its direct release to the environment. Propyl gallate has been detected in corn seed. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.6X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propyl gallate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase propyl gallate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.2 hours. Particulate-phase propyl gallate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Propyl gallate absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, propyl gallate is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 490. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Propyl gallate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Propyl gallate is reported to be biodegradable in the environment with ultimate aerobic degradation estimated to be weeks and primary degradation in days. If released into water, propyl gallate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis half-lives of 12 and 1.2 years have been estimated at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively, at 25 \u00b0C. Photo-oxidation may have some importance in surface waters exposed to sunlight. Occupational exposure to propyl gallate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propyl gallate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to propyl gallate via ingestion of food and dermal contact with consumer products containing propyl gallate. Propyl gallate is used as an antioxidant in a reported 167 cosmetic products. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase propyl gallate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.2 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 9.2X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase propyl gallate may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

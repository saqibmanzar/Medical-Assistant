PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

If released to soil, triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate) will have moderate mobility based on an estimated Koc value of 240. Volatilization of triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate) should not be important from moist soil surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected either based on an estimated vapor pressure of 9X10-5 mm Hg. According to a biodegradation study, triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate) will biodegrade quickly in soil and water. If released to water, triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate) may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate) will be essentially non-volatile from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. An estimated BCF value of 31 suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate, not high. Triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate) has estimated based-catalyzed hydrolysis half-lives of 2.9 years at a pH of 8 and 29 years at a pH of 7. If released to the atmosphere, triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate), which has an estimated vapor pressure of 9X10-5 mm Hg, will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate) is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 10 hours. Particulate-phase triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate) may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate) is produced and used. (SRC)",

Triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate) will be essentially non-volatile from water surfaces(1,SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(3).

Base-catalyzed hydrolysis half-lives for triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylbutyrate) have been estimated(SRC), through a structure estimation method(5), to be 2.9 years and 29 years at pHs of 8 and 7, respectively(5,SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Median subcutaneous lethal doses (LD 50) were determined in mice following acute toxicity tests. Inhalation and dermal toxicity in mice and rabbits, respectively, also were evaluated. LD50s for CD and TCD were >10,000 mg/kg... . Inhalation toxicity tests after one 8 hour exposure to CD, TCD, PZ, or NP revealed increased breathing rate and inertia in the mice, but no mortality occurred. Three test animals died after repeated exposures to TCD and CD continuously for 2 weeks. ...The repeated application of CD to rabbit skin caused only small red spots in some areas. The authors conclude that the toxicities of CD and TCD are lower than the toxicities of NP and PZ.",

Methods of arginase activity determination were not specified. Arginase activity in untreated skin was 15.91 uM of urea per 100 mg. Arginase activity after exposure to ... cyclododecane, ... was ... 23.9 ... uM of urea per 100 mg. Epidermal thickening caused by C5 to C8 cycloalkanes was related to the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. Increases in arginase activity were also related to molecular weight. Changes in epidermal morphology were more pronounced than changes in arginase activity. The authors note that these results are the reverse of those previously reported for linear hydrocarbons, which cause greater changes in arginase activity than in epidermal morphology.",

We initially made a provisional hazard ranking based on available published and unpublished information on aquatic toxicity, bioaccumulation, occurrence and sources. Acute toxicity tests with Daphnia pulex at 17 \u00b0C in reconstituted hard water were performed with 30 compounds representative of the 19 classes that were highest in the provisional ranking. The resulting toxicity data, along with information on the compounds' occurrence in Great Lakes fish and their sources, were ranked and weighted and then used in calculating the revised hazard ranking. The 10 most hazardous classes, in descending order, are as follows (values shown are mean 48-hr EC50s, in ug/mL): arene halides (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls, DDT), 0.0011; phthalate esters, 0.133; chlorinated camphenes (toxaphene), 0.0082; polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; e.g., dimethyl-naphthalene) and reduced derivatives, 1.01; chlorinated fused polycyclics (e.g., trans-nonachlor), 0.022; nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., O-methylhydroxylamine), 1.35; alkyl halides (e.g., (bromomethyl)cyclohexene), 10.1; cyclic alkanes (e.g., cyclododecane), 20.9; silicon-containing compounds (e.g., dimethyldiethoxy silane), 1.25; and heterocyclic nitrogen compounds (e.g., nicotine), 2.48. We recommend that chronic bioassays be conducted with fish and invertebrates to determine the sublethal effects of the following classes of compounds, for which few toxicity data are available: PAHs, heterocyclic nitrogen compounds, other nitrogen-containing compounds, alkyl halides, cyclic alkanes and silicon-containing compounds. Information from these types of studies will aid researchers in determining the possible causal role these contaminants play in the decline and reproductive impairment of Great Lakes fish.",

Its use as a mothproof agent will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.029 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cyclododecane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase cyclododecane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 23 hours. Cyclododecane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, cyclododecane is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 5,300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.54 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. A 6% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test, suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, cyclododecane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours 5 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 9 years if adsorption is considered. A BCF range of 1,100 to 14,400 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to cyclododecane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyclododecane is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.54 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 9 years if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF range of 1,100-14,400(7) suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). A 6% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(7), suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that cyclododecane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 9 years if adsorption is considered. Cyclododecane's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Cyclododecane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 0.029 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(4).",

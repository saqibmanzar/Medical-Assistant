PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

The %s of positive reactions to the preservatives studied are as follows, in descending order: formaldehyde 5.7%, benzalkonium chloride 5.5%, Kathon CG 5.5%, thimerosal 4.2%, chlorhexidine digluconate 2.0%, DMDM hydantoin 1.7%, paraben mix 1.7%, chloroacetamide 1.5%, Bronopol 1.2%, imidazolidinyl urea 1.0%, quaternium 15 1.0%, triclosan 0.8%, 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol 0.4%.

After 24 hours, the eye was rinsed out thoroughly with physiological saline solution. The damage to the eye was assessed 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours following application. The right eye served as the control. After 1 to 7 hours the animals displayed severe reddening and swelling of the conjunctiva. In addition, corneal clouding was seen. The effects cleared up only slowly but were reversible after 21 days following instillation. Accordingly, the authors evaluated chloroacetamide as irritating to the eye.",

A single intraperitoneal dose of 3.75 mg/kg chloroacetamide, dissolved in a 0.9% NaCl solution, had no apparent effect on the lipid peroxidation or hepatic morphology. ... The dose selected for this study was 75 mg/kg because it was nonlethal but induced morphological and biochemical changes. There was a rapid drop in hepatic glutathione concentration during the first hour after administration of the chloroacetamide. Lipid peroxidation, measured by the thiobarbituric acid method, increased after 3 hr and reaches a peak by 24 hr after the dose. Swelling, hydropic degeneration, and single, necrotic hepatocytes were seen by light microscopy in the livers of rats treated with the 75 mg/kg dose. These alterations diffused after 3 hr but were accentuated in the peripheral and midzonal areas after 6 and 8 hr. After 8 hr, Kupffer cell proliferation was noted, although no infiltration of leukocytes could be seen. There were faint signs of hydropic degeneration in the peripheral two thirds of the lobule 1 week after the single dose of 75 mg/kg was administered.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.1X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chloroacetamide will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase chloroacetamide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days. Chloroacetamide does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, chloroacetamide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4.2. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.9X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Chloroacetamide may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Zahn-Wellens test, 90% biodegradation was reached in 6 days indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, chloroacetamide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A hydrolysis half-life of 53 days at pH 8 suggests that hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate process for chloroacetamide in alkaline waters. Occupational exposure to chloroacetamide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chloroacetamide is produced or used. The general population may have been exposed to chloracetamide via dermal contact due to its former use in cosmetic products. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

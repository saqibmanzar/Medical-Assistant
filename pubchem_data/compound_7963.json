When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Unmetabolized gamma-picoline was identified in both expired air and 24 hour urine; excreted amounts were approx 2.5% in each. The mass spectral characteristics of gamma-picoline-N-oxide, methylisonicotinate and methylisonicotinurate in the urine were examined; excreted amounts were 1.5%, 50% and 5% respectively. The /results suggest/ that two metabolic pathways for gamma-picoline are observed: N-oxidation leads to the formation of N-oxide; and methyloxidation leads to the formation of isonicotinic acid excreted mainly unchanged and partly as the glycine conjugate isonicotinuric acid.",

It is used as a solvent in synthesis of pharmaceuticals, resins, dyestuffs, rubber accelerators, and pesticides.It is also used in the production of antituberculosis agent, isoniazid; waterproofing agents fo fabrics; as a laboratory reagent, catalyst, and curing agent. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Symptoms include occasional diarrhea, weight loss, anemia, and ocular and facial paralysis. 4-Methylpyridine induced a dose-related increased frequency of sister chromatid exchange in human lymphocyte cultures from three individuals. Chromosomal aberrations induced by 4-methylpyridine included: chromatid breaks; centromeric, intermediate and terminal chromosome breaks; terminal and interstitial deletions; translocation; dicentric chromosomes;  and isochromosomes. ANIMAL STUDIES: 4-Methylpyridine was severely irritating in rabbit skin tests. It is a potent inhibitor of red cell cholinesterase and an effective miotic inhibitor in mice and rabbits. Adrenal cortisol production also is inhibited by 4-methylpyridine treatment. In neurophysilogical tests in rats 3-methylpyridine and 2-methylpyridine affected electrophysiological parameters more than did 4-methylpyridine. 4-Methylpyridine was not mutagenic in Chinese hamster lung cells, and it was not mutagenic when tested with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102.",

Following either 7 or 14 days the rabbits were killed & histological exams were conducted on the eyes. Eye irritation, caused by these exposures, was characterized by ocular irritation indice (OII). Eye irritation assessments showed that irritation was maximal either 1 hr or 1 day after exposure. Based upon ocular irritation indice values, 2-picoline, 3-picoline & pyridine were classified as \"irritating\", while 4-picoline was classified a \"severely irritating\". ... Over longer periods of time, which included recovery, all four of these cmpds were determined to be \"severely irritating\". Histological exam of the eyes showed similar effects for all 4 cmpds considered. These effects included keratitis lesions in corneal epithelial tissue, fibrillary edematous lamallae dissociation, & cellular inflammatory infiltration. Skin irritation was characterized by the cutaneous primary irritation index (PII). 2-Picoline, 3-picoline, & pyridine had PII values of 5.8, 6.8, & 4.8 respectively, while 4-picoline showed such high percutaneous toxicity that a primary irritation index value could not be determined. Overall results on skin irritation suggested that 2-picoline & 3-picoline should be classified as \"severely irritating\" with pyridine being classified as \"irritating\". Histological exam of the skin provided evidence for necrosis, ulceration, & regeneration.",

The tests contained measures of sensory function (paired pulse flash evoked potentials, pattern reversal evoked potentials, and brainstem auditory evoked responses) and cerebral excitability (pentylenetetrazol seizures and hippocampal afterdischarges). In general, rats treated with 2- and 3-methylpyridine were more affected than those treated with 4-methylpyridine. The changes observed were in many ways similar to those seen following administration of depressant compounds: increased latency of evoked potentials and increased latency to pentylenetetrazol seizures. ... Controls were treated with saline. The LD50s were 200 mg/kg for 2-methylpyridine, 150 mg/kg for 3-methylpyridine, and 162 mg/kg for 4-methylpyridine. Death occurred within 24 to 48 hours after treatment. All of the methylpyridines produced a mild hypothermia. 3-Methylpyridine and 2-methylpyridine affected electrophysiological parameters more than did 4-methylpyridine. /Results indicate/ that all three compounds produce dysfunctions that only vary in magnitude.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.77 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-methylpyridine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-methylpyridine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6 days. 4-Methylpyridine does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 4-methylpyridine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 115. The pKa of 4-methylpyridine is 5.98, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Koc can vary with pH with lowest adsorption occurring in the non-ionized form. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 4-Methylpyridine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 4-Methylpyridine may biodegrade fairly rapidly under aerobic conditions in both soil and water. 4-Methylpyridine is expected to be resistant to biodegradation under some anaerobic conditions. Acclimation of microbes may be important as demonstrated by complete degradation of 4-methylpyridine in 2 weeks in polluted soil versus 3 months in unpolluted soil. If released into water, 4-methylpyridine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc value. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 and 47 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. In water, 4-methylpyridine was rapidly biodegraded in acclimated aerobic natural waters with complete removal within 2 to 4 days. In sulfidogenic estuarine sediments, however, 4-methylpyridine was not biodegraded over 200 days. Occupational exposure to 4-methylpyridine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-methylpyridine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 4-methylpyridine via inhalation of ambient air, and ingestion of food and drinking water. Since 4-methylpyridine has been identified as a component of cigarette smoke, people who smoke or inhale second-hand smoke may be exposed to higher levels of 4-methylpyridine than the general population.

The pKa of 4-methylpyridine is 5.98(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Soil studies with 2-methylpyridine(5), a compound expected to have similar sorption properties as 4-methylpryidine(SRC), demonstrated that Koc can vary with pH with lowest adsorption occurring in the non-ionized form(5). Volatilization of 4-methylpyridine from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 6.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(6). 4-Methylpyridine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 5.77 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(7). 4-Methylpyridine may biodegrade fairly rapidly in aerobic soil; however, under anaerobic conditions, this compound is expected to be persistent(8,9). 71.7 and 100% of the available nitrogen was released as inorganic nitrogen within 16 and 32 days following the incubation of 4-methylpyridine in aerobic Fincastle silt loam(7). 4-Methylpyridine added to an unpolluted surface soil under denitrifying or sulfidogenic conditions was 40 to 50% degraded in 3 months(8). Acclimation of microbes may be important as demonstrated by complete degradation of 4-methylpyridine in 2 weeks in polluted soil versus 3 months in unpolluted soil(9).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 and 47 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.22(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 4-Methylpyridine may biodegrade fairly rapidly in aerobic waters; however, under anaerobic conditions, this compound is expected to be persistent. Complete biodegradation of 4-methylpyridine was reported in 2 to 4 days following incubation in acclimated natural waters(7). No biodegradation was reported over 200 days when 4-methylpyridine was incubated in sulfidogenic estuarine sediment(8). 4-Methylpyridine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). The UV absorption spectrum of 4-methylpyridine in aqueous solution shows no absorption >290 nm(9); therefore, 4-methylpyridine is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Vapor-phase 4-methylpyridine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.69X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3).

In addition, an aerobic soil grab sample study demonstrated rapid biodegradation of 4-methylpyridine(2). 4-Methylpyridine was added to Fincastle silt loam (Aeric Ochraqualf) with a pH of 6.7 and incubated at 25 \u00b0C(2). Within 16 and 32 days, 71.7% and 100%, respectively, of the available nitrogen was released as inorganic nitrogen (NH+4, NO-2, NO-3)(2). Sterilized controls lost 21.8% of the starting material to volatilization, but did not release inorganic nitrogen(2). An aerobic river die-away test also showed that 4-methylpyridine biodegraded rapidly after acclimation in highly polluted natural waters maintained at 20 \u00b0C(3). After 14- and 18-day acclimation periods, 100% of the original concentration of 1 ppm of 4-methylpyridine were removed within 2 and 4 days from the Ohio and Little Miami River waters, respectively(3). A screening test, which utilized 5 mL garden soil suspensions with glucose, yeast extract and mineral salts, compared aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation of 4-methylpyridine(4); at concentrations of 93 and 94 ppm, 4-methylpyridine completely degraded within 66 to 170 days and 32 to 66 days under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively(4). In an anaerobic biodegradation study using sludge from a wastewater treatment plant digester as inoculum, 4-methylpyridine was found to have poor biodegradability(5).",

Aerobic degradation of 4-methylpyridine was slow but complete within 2 months in unpolluted surface soil(1). Under denitrifying and sulfate-reducing conditions, approximately 40 to 50% and 10% degradation of 4-methylpyridine was reported in 3 months in an unpolluted surface and subsurface soil, respectively(1). In polluted aerobic surface and subsurface soils, degradation was complete within 2 weeks(1). Under denitrifying conditions, 65 and 20% degradation were reported after 3 months for polluted surface and subsurface soils, respectively; under sulfate-reducing conditions, 90 and 100% degradation was reported after 3 months for polluted surface and subsurface soils, respectively(1). Columns filled with aquifer material and leached with contaminated ground water from the Reilly site in Indianapolis, Indiana were run under aerobic conditions(2). 68.5% removal was observed after 35 days of operation(2). 4-Methylpyridine was incubated in sulfidogenic estuarine sediments at concentrations from 70 to 80 uM; no biodegradation was reported over 200 days(3).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that 3-methylpyridine is expected to have high mobility in soil. The pKa of 4-methylpyridine is 5.98(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Soil studies with 2-methylpyridine(5), a compound expected to have similar sorption properties as 4-methylpryidine(SRC), demonstrated that Koc can vary with pH with lowest adsorption occurring in the non-ionized form(5). Spectral studies of 4-methylpyridine adsorbed to hydrated and dehydrated silica indicate that hydrogen bonding occurs with silica surface silanols via the nitrogen atom on the pyridine ring and that this interaction is stronger than that between this compound and water(6).",

The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 47 days(SRC). 4-Methylpyridine's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 4-Methylpyridine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 5.77 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(3). 4-Methylpyridine is a weak base with a pKa of 5.98(4), which indicates this compound will partially exist in the protonated form in acidic conditions, and no volatilization from water or moist soil will occur for the cation(SRC).",

A 1982 study showed 4-methylpyridine was emitted to the air from wastewaters at a shale oil facility exposing inside workers(2). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 4-methylpyridine via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of cigarette smoke, and ingestion of food and contaminated drinking water(SRC).",

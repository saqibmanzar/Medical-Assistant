Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Farnesol metabolism was examined by a sensitive LC (liquid chromatography)-MS/MS method. Results indicate that farnesol is a good substrate for glucuronidation in human liver, kidney and intestine microsomes (values in nmol/min per mg). Initial analysis using expressed human UGTs indicated that UGTs 1A1 and 2B7 were primarily responsible for glucuronidation in vitro, with significantly lower activity for all the other UGTs tested (UGTs 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9 and 2B4). Kinetic analysis and inhibition experiments indicate that, in liver microsomes, UGT1A1 is primarily responsible for farnesol glucuronidation; however, in intestine microsomes, UGT2B7 is probably the major isoform involved, with a very-low-micromolar K(m). ...",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Significant dose-dependent restoration was recorded in renal glutathione content, its dependent enzymes and other phase II metabolizing enzymes viz., catalase, glutathione-S-transferase and quinone reductase (p < 0.001) with prophylactic treatment of FL. Present results support that FL markedly lowers the oxidative damage and appearance of tumor markers ...",

No deaths occurred during the study, and farnesol had no significant effects on body weight, food consumption, clinical signs, or hematology/coagulation parameters. ... At the termination of dosing, the activities of CYP1A, CYP2A1-3, CYP2B1/2, CYP2C11/12, CYP2E1, CYP3A1/2, CYP4A1-3, CYP19, glutathione reductase, NADPH/quinone oxidoreductase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase were significantly increased in the livers of farnesol-treated rats; farnesol also increased the activity of glutathione S-transferase in the kidney. The effects of farnesol on hepatic and renal enzymes were reversed during the recovery period. At the end of the dosing period, increases in absolute and relative liver and kidney weights were seen in farnesol-treated rats. ...",

It is found in some essential oils. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.9X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates farnesol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase farnesol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.4 hrs. Particulate-phase farnesol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Farnesol does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, farnesol is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, farnesol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Data regarding biodegradation using mixed cultures were not available. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9.5 hrs and 7.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 5,500 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to farnesol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where farnesol is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to farnesol via inhalation, ingestion of food, and dermal contact with this compound and other consumer products containing farnesol.

Vapor-phase farnesol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.4 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.7X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase farnesol may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

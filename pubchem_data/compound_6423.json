Chloropicrin can be absorbed systemically through inhalation, ingestion, and the skin. At high concentrations it is severely irritating to the lungs, eyes, and skin. In World War I German forces used concentrated chloropicrin against Allied forces as a tear gas. While not as lethal as other chemical weapons, it caused vomiting and forced Allied soldiers to remove their masks to vomit, exposing them to other, more toxic chemical gases used as weapons during the war.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

When used as a warning agent prior to sulfuryl fluoride residential structure fumigations, a tent must first be put up around the structure. Chloropicrin is then placed in the center of the structure in either a shallow pan or onto absorbent material. A fan is then placed to direct the air stream over the pan or absorbent material to accelerate the chloropicrin's evaporation. Chloropicrin should be applied 5 to 10 minutes before sulfuryl fluoride is introduced into the structure. For remedial wood treatment, chloropicrin is either poured/injected or applied with encapsulated vials into pre-drilled holes. ...  After the chloropicrin has been applied, the holes are immediately plugged.",

The Ca(ClO)2 is first removed by reduction with FeSO4 at 90-95 deg, and pH of 11-11.5. Complete removal is achieved in 3 hours. The nitro compounds are then reduced to MeNH2 and triaminophenol by heating the effluent from the first stage with FeSO4 and Fe turnings at 90-95 deg. Reduction of the nitro compounds is approx 81% complete, the residue containing compounds are not readily reduced. The MeNH2 vapor is oxidized to MeOH in a reactor containing a soln of NaNO2 and HCl at 5-6 deg. The reaction time is 2-2.5 hours. The MeOH and triaminophenol are then oxidized with Ca(ClO)2, and the final treated effluent is clearified before discharge.",

Although not specifically suggested as a decontamination procedure, the rapid reaction of chloropicrin with ammonia to produce guanidine (LD50= 500) could be used for detoxication. The Manufacturing Chemists Association suggest two procedures for disposal of chloropicrin: 1) Pour or sift over soda ash. Mix and wash slowly into large tank. 2) Adsorb on vermiculite. Mix and shovel into paper boxes. Drop into incinerator with afterburner and scrubber. Recommendable methods: Neutralization, & incineration.",

Buffer zones may not include agricultural areas owned/operated by persons other than the owner/operator of the application block unless 1. The owner/operator of the application block can ensure that the buffer zone will not overlap with a buffer zone from any adjacent property owners, and 2. The owner/operator of the areas that are not under the control of the application provides written agreement to the applicator that they, their employees, and other persons will stay out of the buffer zone during the entire buffer zone period.  Buffer zones may not include publicly owned and/or operated areas (e.g., parks, rights of way, side walks, walking paths, playgrounds, athletic fields, etc) unless 1. The area is not occupied during the buffer zone period, 2. Entry by non-handlers is prohibited during the buffer zone period, and 3. Written permission to include the public area in the buffer zone is granted by the appropriate state and/or local authorities responsible for management and operation of the area.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The EPA assumes that half-face respirators have a protection factor of 10, therefore the respiratory protection will only be protective up to chloropicrin concentrations of 1.5 ppm, and if measured concentrations exceed 1.5 ppm work operations must cease. A self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) has a protection factor of 1,000, but must only be used for brief durations to take actions to reduce air concentration levels or in case of an emergency. As a result the new IDLH of 2 ppm will not be a trigger to put on SCBA. Respirator APR-cartridge combinations from other manufacturers will also be considered by the /EPA/, provided written certification of their efficiency against chloropicrin is provided.",

The Agency has determined that most of the supported uses of chloropicrin will not pose unreasonable risks or adverse effects to humans or the environment provided that the risk mitigation measures and label changes outlined in this RED are implemented. The Agency does not have adequate data to evaluate the risks associated with untarped chloropicrin drip applications that are buried a minimum of 5 inches. The CMTF has just submitted a study, and provided the study is acceptable and the Agency can determine appropriate risk mitigation, this use will be eligible for reregistration. Based on its evaluation of chloropicrin, the Agency has determined that chloropicrin products, unless labeled and used as specified in this document, would present risks inconsistent with FIFRA. Accordingly, should a registrant fail to implement any of the risk mitigation measures identified in this document, the Agency may take regulatory action to address the risk concerns from the use of chloropicrin. If all changes outlined in this document are incorporated into the product labels, then current risks for chloropicrin will be adequately mitigated for the purposes of this determination under FIFRA.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Chloropicrin is found on List A, which contains most food use pesticides and consists of the 194 chemical cases (or 350 individual active ingredients) for which EPA issued registration standards prior to FIFRA, as amended in 1988. Case No: 0040; Pesticide type: Insecticide; Registration Standard Date: 09/28/82; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document.; Active ingredient (AI): Chloropicrin; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 09/28/90; AI Status: The producers of the pesticide have made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

A total of 165 persons experienced symptoms consistent with chloropicrin exposure. The findings underscore health risks associated with fumigants and the usefulness of procedures adopted in California to ensure both prompt identification of exposure events and timely notification of the affected public.  On October 3, 2003, an agricultural pest control service began applying 100% chloropicrin at a concentration of 80 pounds/acre to 34 acres of fallow land in Kern County. Chloropicrin was injected 17 to 18 inches into the soil; a weighted board was used to compact the soil, treating 18 acres. That evening, residents living one quarter mile west of the application site experienced irritant symptoms. The Kern County Fire Department (KCFD) was contacted to investigate; however, darkness, distance from the treated field, and absence of chloropicrin odor prevented firefighters from identifying the source of the irritation. Records from a weather station approximately 7 miles southeast of the application site indicated low wind speeds and stable atmospheric conditions but also that the wind direction had changed that evening, blowing from the field toward the residential dwellings. The next day, chloropicrin was applied to the remaining 16 acres. A 60-foot, chloropicrin-free buffer was maintained around the perimeter of the field because workers noted a persistent odor when they arrived. Residents one quarter mile west and south of the field complained about irritant symptoms that evening. Residents notified KCFD; several responding firefighters experienced eye irritation. The wind had changed again that evening and begun blowing from the field toward the residential dwellings. Suspecting a pesticide release, KCFD notified KCAC. The field was recompacted, and the odor ceased. On October 6, KCAC notified CPDR about the incident. KCAC and CDPR conducted in-person interviews at 35 households located approximately one quarter mile west and south of the field and at a day care center; additional interviews were conducted on October 15. The 35 households and day care center had a total of 172 persons present during the exposure period. Representatives from each household and the day care center were interviewed by using a standardized questionnaire. In addition, five workers involved with the fumigation were questioned informally, and KCFD records were reviewed to identify affected firefighters. The investigation determined that 165 persons reported symptoms compatible with illness caused by chloropicrin; median age of the persons was 16 years (range: 3 months--63 years). Nearly all (99%) had irritant symptoms (e.g., eye or upper respiratory) (Table); nine (5%) received medical evaluations. Seven had persistent respiratory symptoms when interviewed 11 days after the event. Follow-up medical care was limited because most of the affected persons lacked health insurance.  Exposures were retrospectively estimated by using a standard air dispersion model (3). Estimated 1-hour average chloropicrin air concentrations in areas south and west of the field ranged up to 0.20 parts per million (ppm). Peak-to-mean extrapolations indicated that peak concentrations might have exceeded 1 ppm. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-recommended exposure limit is 0.10 ppm averaged during 8 hours. However, extrapolations from animal studies suggest 0.0044 ppm as a safe level for a 1-hour environmental exposure (4).  According to KCAC, a possible cause of the offsite drift was failure to contain the chloropicrin adequately after application. After the incident, KCAC imposed new restrictions on chloropicrin applications, including prohibition of applications within one quarter mile of an occupied structure and mandatory use of a heavy-duty tarp or water seal for applications within one half mile of such structures...",

Eleven of the 54 people who were sickened were doctors; another 20 were staffers at the hospital in the city of Kumamoto.  The liquid pesticide the man consumed was later identified as chloropicrin, which was used to produce tear gas during World War I and induces tears and vomiting.  It took a long time to determine the kind of chemical, said the doctor who treated the man in the emergency room.  The hospital's emergency center was closed for about 12 hours after the incident.",

Subjects participated in exposure chambers for 1 hour each on Monday through Thursday (4 consecutive days).  The 3 cycles included exposure to 100 ppb, 150 ppb, and just air (blank). The order in which the subject was exposed to these concentrations was random ... Subjects gave higher ratings to symptoms in the eye than to those in the nose and throat. Subjects gave nominally slightly higher ratings in the nose than in the throat, but expressed no symptoms of consequence at either site. There was no indication of intensification of symptoms based on subject scoring for any parameter on the consecutive days of exposure. For the eye, the study report ANOVA indicated Level (p<0.001), and interaction of Level by Duration was significant (p<0.001).  ANOVA also revealed an effect of Level by Day (p<0.02). As a group with all subjects included (even those not feeling), the analysis provided in the study indicate the average rating of eye irritation at 100 ppb reached approximately 0.5 (1=mild) with 30 minutes to reach steady state, which remained until the final minutes and then sometimes regressed. At 150 ppb, the average rating of eye irritation reached 1 (mild, symptom present, but minimal awareness, easily tolerated) with 20 minutes to steady state until fading slightly at the final minutes. On an individual level, the severity of ocular irritation reported ... varied from no symptoms to severe at both 100 ppb and 150 ppb. 5 of 17 females (29%) and 7 of 15 males (47%) rated no eye irritation at 100 ppb while 3 of 17 females (18%) and 5 of 15 males (33%) rated no eye irritation at 150 ppb. Nasal and throat irritation was never reported above a \"2\" ... . Scores of severe \"3\" ocular irritation were sporadic during the first 30 minutes of exposure in 2 females and in 4 males at 100 ppb. The second half of the exposure to 100 ppb (31-60 minutes) revealed a more consistent response in ocular severity (3 females, 5 males).  ... At 150 ppb, 4 females and 3 males reported consistent severe eye irritation beginning as early as 8 to 9 minutes of exposure until the end of exposure at 60 minutes. Moderate \"2\" eye irritation was also reported sporadically during the first 30 minutes by the same individuals reporting severe eye irritation but with a more consistent response in moderate eye irritation during the second half (31-60 minutes) of exposure. Two additional females and two additional males reported moderate eye irritation during the second half of exposure that did not report eye irritation during the first half of exposure. Results for the daily measurements (Cochran Q test) provided in the study indicated the number of times a rating post-exposure exceeded a rating pre-exposure for nasal congestion was not significant (Q = 0.75) while eye irritation (redness) was significant (Q = 28.8, p < 0.001). Nasal congestion and ocular erythema (redness) occurred more than the trivial frequency. However ... the ocular irritation did not translate into more prominent redness. No biologically significant changes were observed for the lower respiratory variables. For the lower respiratory variables (FVC, FEV1, eNO), ANOVA ... indicated a significant interaction of Level by Order (p < 0.05) for FVC (Forced Vital Capacity), with only 3% variation in FVC.  FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume), averaged 93.6% before exposure and 93.7% after exposure. The variation spanned 3% with no significance achieved. Exhaled nitric oxide by the lungs (eNO) equaled 37.8 before exposure and 39.2 after exposure with no significance achieved. Sex was not significant for any of interactions of the three lower respiratory variables. Two upper respiratory alterations, nNO (nasal nitric oxide) and flow, were observed for one-hour exposures that occurred only day by day. For the upper respiratory variables (nNO, inspiratory flow, expiratory flow), nNO was significant for Level by Order with 399 ppb before exposure and 425 ppb after exposure (p = 0.012).  Level by Order by Day was not significant. nNO increased 1% after exposure to blank, 10% after exposure to 100 ppb, and 8% after exposure to 150 ppb. The effect of nNO did not continue from one day to the next. Inspiratory flow and expiratory flow equaled 450 and 415 mL/sec, respectively, before exposure and 435 and 406 mL/sec, respectively, after exposure. Chloropicrin had a differential effect on flow. Level by Order was nearly significant (p = 0.087) with Level by Order by Day not significant.  Flow decreased 2% after exposure to blank and increased 2% after exposure to 100 ppb chloropicrin, however, flow decreased by 8% after exposure to 150 ppb. Sex was not significant in any of the relevant interactions for the upper respiratory variables. Physiological effects such as changes in nNO and flow rate may indicate signs of nasal congestion and engorgement. Cell types and cell numbers from the ... samples (nose or eye) were approximately the same at the end of the cycle as at the beginning. ... 53% of subjects reported a non-zero response to /nasal/ congestion after 4 days of exposure to the blank vs 41% and 34% after exposures to 150 ppb and 100 ppb, respectively. The average ratings equaled 0.53, 0.34, and 0.41 for the blank, 100 ppb, and 150 ppb, respectively, where a rating of 1 signified \"hardly troubled at all\". Watery eyes, sore eyes, and swollen eyes were scored higher by subjects after exposure to either 100 or 150 ppb chloropicrin than to the blank. The Q test revealed significance for the sore eyes only (p < 0.05). The highest rating given after exposure to swollen eyes was 0.47. The LOAEL is 100 ppb, the lowest concentration tested, based on eye irritation, increased nasal nitric oxide (nNO), and differential effect on inspiratory and expiratory flow.

As such, chloropicrin may be detected at concentrations that are lower than would be expected to result in port-of-entry related toxic effects ... Responses from a sensory irritant are distinct from that of chemical stimulation (specialized olfactory or taste receptor cells).  Irritation responses from a sensory irritant may include localized and transient chemosensations such as burning, itching, and stinging, as well as associated physiologic (eg, secretory) responses resulting from surrounding tissues (eg, eyelid closure, inflammation, etc).  It should also be noted that detection of a sensory irritant does not necessarily equate to an adverse effect since detection of the chemical in the eyes or nose may be below the concentration that causes more severe irritation.",

Each exposure was followed by a 14 day observation period. The LC50 values for the whole-body and nose-only exposures were 14.4 and 6.6 ppm, respectively. In the dermal exposure experiment, no deaths occurred in the rats exposed to chloropicrin vapor at a mean actual concentration of 25.0 ppm. In the whole body exposure experiment, chloropicrin vapor produced a biphasic toxic manifestation. The first phase lasted about 3 days after exposure, and the second phase was between post-exposure days 6 and 14. Irritation and/or damage to the respiratory tract was mainly observed in both phases. Most deaths occurred within 24 hr after exposure. The rest were caused by a high exposure concentration, and the dead animals were found on post-exposure day 9. In the nose-only exposure experiment, toxic effects were observed only in the first phase and they were similar to those in the whole-body exposure experiment. All deaths occurred within 24 hr after exposure. In the dermal exposure experiment, no toxic effects were observed. Acute dermal toxicity of chloropicrin vapor due to whole-body exposure was minimal compared to acute inhalation toxicity, and restraint of experimental animals during the nose-only exposure increased the acute inhalation toxicity of chloropicrin vapor.",

Its use as a fumigant and soil insecticide will result in its direct release to the environment. During World War I, it was employed as both a lacrimator and as a lethal chemical; its toxicity makes for a poor riot control agent. Chloropicrin is a disinfection byproduct formed upon the addition of chlorine to water containing organic matter. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 23.8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chloropicrin will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase chloropicrin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 123 days. Chloropicrin absorbs UV light in the 280 to 390 nm range and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis. If released to soil, chloropicrin is expected to have high mobility based upon a Koc of 81. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.05X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Chloropicrin may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Half-lives in soil ranging from 0.2 to 4.5 days at 20 \u00b0C suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, chloropicrin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. A half-life of 0.5 days in activated sludge suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 8 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Chloropicrin is stable to hydrolysis in neutral aqueous solution. Occupational exposure to chloropicrin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chloropicrin is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to chloropicrin via inhalation of ambient air following adjacent agricultural applications and ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 8(SRC), from its log Kow of 2.09(5) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Chloropicrin photohydrolyzes rapidly in water when exposed to light below 300 nm producing CO2, chloride and nitrate in the presence of air; its half-life in sunlight is about 3 days(7). However, under ambient room light chloropicrin is stable to photodegradation(7). The photooxidation of vapor-phase chloropicrin to form phosgene has also been observed in the field(8). A half-life of 0.5 days in activated sludge(9) suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase chloropicrin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 120 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.3X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Chloropicrin absorbs UV light in the 280 to 390 nm range(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis(SRC).",

Degradation rates at 20 \u00b0C were 0.45 d-1, 0.16 d-1, and 3.25 d-1, respectively, corresponding to half-lives of 1.5, 4.3 and 0.2 days, respectively(2). Degradation rates at 30 \u00b0C were 0.62 d-1, 0.49 d-1, and 8.37 d-1, respectively, and at 40 \u00b0C were 1.78 d-1, 0.95 d-1, and 13.99 d-1, respectively, showing that degradation accelerates as soil temperature increases(2). Several Pseudomonas sp. isolated from soil dehalogenate chloropicrin(3). One strain of Pseudomonas putida transformed chloropicrin to nitromethane in three successive reductive dehalogenation steps in the course of about an hour(3).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 120 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Chloropicrin is stable in neutral aqueous solution with no hydrolysis being detected after 10 days and a minimum half-life of 11 yrs(2). At 25 \u00b0C hydrolysis half-life has been extrapolated to 5X10+6 years(1). At a concentration of 65X10-4 M/L and in contact with 0.5 g parrot feather plant in a 2.5 mL vial, chloropicrin degraded with a half-life of less than 20 hours, attributed to enzymatic dehalogenation(6). The compound photohydrolyzes rapidly in water when exposed to light below 300 nm producing CO2, chloride and nitrate in the presence of air, with a half-life in sunlight of about 3 days(2). However, under ambient room light chloropicrin is stable to photodegradation(2). While no particular cases where found in the literature, dehalogenation reactions may be chemically, as well as biologically catalyzed(3). Under simulated atmospheric conditions, the vapor photodegrades to phosgene and nitrosyl chloride (half-life 20 days) with the nitrosyl chloride further photolyzing to chlorine and nitric oxide(4). The photooxidation of chloropicrin in the vapor phase to form phosgene has also been observed in the field(5). Chloropicrin absorbs UV light in the 280 to 390 nm range(7) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis(SRC). In environmental chamber studies it was shown to greatly enhance rates of NO oxidation and O3 formation(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In a survey of 14 treated drinking water supplies of varied sources in England, chloropicrin was detected in 3 supplies that were obtained from rivers(2). Among the 14 medium and large water treatment plants surveyed in Utah (serving >10,000 people), the mean, median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile concn of chloropicrin was 0.37, 0.51, 0.47, and 0.55 ug/L, respectively(3). In a previous nationwide survey of disinfection byproducts in drinking water, the median concn of chloropicrin was 0.1 ug/L(3). Chloropicrin concentration in finished water from 35 US water treatment facilities ranged from not detected (detection limit not specified) to 0.59 ug/L, median of 0.12 ug/L(4). It was reported at a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.5 ug/L in 73% of finished water samples collection from 53 Canadian water treatment facilities(4). The compound was identified in finished drinking water that had been treated by ozone and combinations of ozone with chlorine and chloramine(5). Ozonations were carried out at a plant that treats Mississippi River Water in Jefferson Parish, LA. Treatments occurred in four rounds on January 1994 (total organic carbon 2.7 mg/L; temperature 7.8 \u00b0C; pH 7.4; alkalinity 102 mg/L), August 1994 (total organic carbon 2.6 mg/L; temperature 28.5 \u00b0C; pH 7.6; alkalinity 110 mg/L), May 1995 (total organic carbon 3.7 mg/L; temperature 18.5 \u00b0C; pH 7.5; alkalinity 112 mg/L), and September 1996 (total organic carbon 3.0 mg/L; temperature 28.5 \u00b0C; pH 7.9; alkalinity 140 mg/L)(5). Chloropicrin was detected not quantified in the May 1995 and September 1996 treatment rounds(5).",

The use of ozone in water treatment to reduce trihalomethanes (especially ozonation followed by chloramination), appears to increase the amount of chloropicrin in the treated water. In two utilities studied, the concn of chloropicrin in the treated water was 0.073 and 0.25 ppb using chlorine alone and 0.49 and 0.57 ppb when both ozone and chlorine treatment was used(3). In another study chlorination of water from mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes produced 0.4 and 2 ppb of chloropicrin; with preozonation these levels increased to about 2 and 6 ppb, respectively(4). Chloropicrin may be formed during the chlorination of industrial waste water. Studies show that the chlorination of nonnitrogenous organic compounds (0.1 mmol/L) in the presence of nitrites (0.1 mmol/L) can lead to chloropicrin formation(1). Among these, phenolic compounds and 2- and 3-hydroxyphenol, in particular, give the highest production rates. Choropicrin is also readily formed from nitromethane during chlorination(2).",

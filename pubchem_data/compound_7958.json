Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this colorless peppermint-smelling oily liquid may occur from its use as a solvent for nitrocellulose, crepe rubber, and vinylite, and as an intermediate in the synthesis of inhibitors, pharmaceuticals, dyes, and insecticides. Effects from exposure may include irritation or contact burns to the skin and eyes, shortness of breath, nausea, headache, dizziness, fainting, coma and death. Both the ACGIH and the final rule for the OSHA PEL have been set at a TWA of 25 ppm. Even though the odor of diisobutyl ketone may provide sufficient warning of its presence, in activities or situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and appropriate chemical protective clothing, including gloves and boots. If contact should occur, immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. Diisobutyl ketone may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames. Its heavier than air vapor may travel to a source of ignition and flash back, or result in a build-up of explosive concentrations in enclosed spaces such as sewers. Also, containers may explode in the heat of a fire. Fires involving diisobutyl ketone may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, alcohol foam, and water spray, mist, or fog (solid streams of water may be ineffective). Since diisobutyl ketone fires may produce irritating or poisonous gases, when tank cars or trucks are involved, isolate the area for one half mile in all directions. Fight the fire from as far a distance as possible, and dike runoff from fire control water. Diisobutyl ketone should be stored in cool, well-ventilated place, away from direct sunlight, sources of ignition, and oxidizing materials. Diisobutyl ketone may be shipped via air, rail, road, and water. Small spills of diisobutyl ketone may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. Large spills should be diked far ahead of the spill for later disposal. Before implementing land disposal of waste diisobutyl ketone, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.65 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diisobutyl ketone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diisobutyl ketone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 hours. The photochemical degradation products of diisobutyl ketone with hydroxyl radicals are acetone and 2-methylpropanal. Diisobutyl ketone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diisobutyl ketone is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 57. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Diisobutyl ketone may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Diisobutyl ketone was aerobically biodegraded 4-88% over periods of 5-20 days, therefore biodegradation is expected in soil and water. If released into water, diisobutyl ketone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 hours and 7.5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to diisobutyl ketone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diisobutyl ketone is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to diisobutyl ketone via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing diisobutyl ketone.

Vapor-phase diisobutyl ketone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.6X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The photochemical degradation products of diisobutyl ketone with hydroxyl radicals are acetone and 2-methylpropanal(4). Diisobutyl ketone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(5).",

Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that diisobutyl ketone is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 12 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 7.5 days(SRC). Diisobutyl ketone's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of diisobutyl from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

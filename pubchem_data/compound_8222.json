PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Growth on C20 to C40 alkanes was even better than on C10 to C18 alkanes. Biomass samples incubated for 6 hr with n-octacosane (C28) or n-nonacosane (C29) accumulated these compounds as the predominant constituent alkanes of the cell hydrocarbon fractions. The even chain hexadecane C16 and the odd chain pentadecane C15 were the second dominant constituent alkanes in C28 and C29 incubated cells, respectively. n-Hexadecane-incubated cells accumulated in their lipids higher proportions of C16-fatty acids than control cells not incubated with hydrocarbons. On the other hand, C28 and C29-incubated cells did not contain any fatty acids with the equivalent chain lengths, but the fatty acid patterns of the cell lipids suggest that there should have been mid-chain oxidation of these very long chain alkanes. This activity qualifies A. nicotianae KCC B35 to be used in cocktails for bioremediating environments polluted with heavy oil sediments.",

Gravimetric concentrations of dissolved lipids in the Gulf of Mexico were in the range of 60-160 mg/L in near-surface waters and 61-116 ug/L in near bottom waters and accounted for approximately 4% of the dissolved organic C. Over a 12-hr sampling period and a 5-day sampling period extensive variability in dissolved lipid quantity and quality were observed. The major percentage of extractable weight was collected in the polar liquid chromatographic fraction (55-95%). Gas chromatographic concentrations of the aliphatic fractions were in the range of 0.014-0.187 ug/L. Concentrations derived from gas chromatography were consistently lower than gravimetrically-derived concentrations. A number of compounds were tentatively identified by a combination of GC, GC-MS, and authentic standards. The major components of the analyzable dissolved lipids were n-alkanes (C16-C32), pristane, phytane, methyl, ethyl and propyl esters of fatty acids. Minor components included olefins and cycloalkanes, aromatics, short-chained acids, and possibly a lactone and an alcohol. All concentrations and compounds were indicative of a fairly pristine environment. The n-alkane distribution appears to be the result of marine and terrestrial inputs superimposed on a chronic low-level background of oil pollution. The fatty acid esters and other fragment molecules may be the result of the degradation of humic substances. A number of potential indicators of source were isolated. /n-Alkanes/",

The detection limits were 2-3 ppb for n-alkane, 0.1-0.2 ppb for PAH and 0.2 ppb for DBT. The concentrations of petroleum-related contaminants in seafoods, collected either from waters that were outside the spill area or before the oil spill, were determined by the GC/MS (SIM) method. Levels of total n-alkanes ranged from nd (not detected) to 532 ppb and those of PAH and DBT ranged from nd to 15.5 ppb.

Solid n-alkanes (paraffin waxes) are also used as feeds for cracking them to gasoline blendstock materials, oxidation, and chlorination reactions. Recently, it has been reported that n-alkanes are principal components of diesel exhaust nanoparticles. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: There are no data available. ANIMAL STUDIES: The addition of increasing amounts of eicosane to mouse surfactant increases surface compressibility at 30 mN/m during the second compression, suggesting that the deposition of alkane-rich nanoparticles onto pulmonary surfactants may be related to dysfunction of surfactant activity during breathing. A structure activity relationship of pure n-alkanes was undertaken in a mouse ear edema model to investigate the mechanism of cumulative irritancy. Alkanes were applied twice daily over a 4-day period. Hexadecane, octadecane, and eicosane exhibited progressively decreasing activity.",

Maintain an open airway and assist ventilation if necessary. Administer supplemental oxygen. Monitor arterial blood gases or oximetry, chest radiographs, and ECG and admit symptomatic patients to an intensive care setting. Use epinephrine and other beta-adrenergic medications with caution in patients with significant hydrocarbon intoxication because arrhythmias may be induced. 2. Pulmonary aspiration. Patients who remain completely asymptomatic after 4-6 hours of observation may be discharged. In contrast, if the patient is coughing on arrival, aspiration probably has occurred. Administer supplemental oxygen and treat bronchospasm and hypoxia if they occur. Do not use steroids or prophylactic antibiotics. 3. Ingestion. In the vast majority of accidental childhood ingestions, less than 5-10 mL is actually swallowed and systemic toxicity is rare. Treatment is primarily supportive. Injection. For injections into the fingertip or hand, especially those involving a high-pressure paint gun, consult with a plastic or hand surgeon immediately, as prompt wide exposure, irrigation, and debridement are often required. /Hydrocarbons/",

A structure activity relationship of pure n-alkanes was undertaken in a mouse ear edema model to investigate the mechanism of cumulative irritancy. Alkanes were applied twice daily over a 4-day period. Dodecane was found to be non-irritating, while tridecane elicited a response only at 96 hr. Tetradecane was the strongest irritant with significant increases (p less than 0.05) in ear thickness observed at 48 hr. Hexadecane, octadecane, and eicosane exhibited progressively decreasing activity. Permeability of the ears to hydrocortisone was monitored in vitro during tridecane- and tetradecane-induced irritation. Significant increases in permeability were observed 24 hr before edema formation. A positive correlation was found between the extent of edema formation and enhancement of permeability. Loss of barrier function would result in increased cutaneous availability of the alkanes. Increased permeability prior to edema formation indicates that induction of barrier dysfunction may be a factor in the mechanism of alkane-induced irritation.",

We investigated the effects of n-alkanes on the surface activity of a pulmonary surfactant monolayer using both fresh surfactant isolated from mouse lungs, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), a major component of lung surfactant. To examine the effect of n-alkanes on the surfactant, we compared surface pressure/trough area isotherm features and topographic images of DPPC in the presence and absence of a specific n-alkane (eicosane, C(20)H(42)) by Langmuir-Wilhelmy methods. The pure DPPC isotherm shows a typical plateau feature at a monolayer collapse pressure of 70 mN/m. The collapse pressure diminishes with increasing concentration of eicosane in DPPC. DPPC monolayers containing eicosane exhibit isotherms with one phase transition, but not the coexistence plateau of a liquid-expanded (LE) and liquid-condensed (LC) phase observed with a pure DPPC monolayer. Atomic force microscopy studies suggest that a DPPC monolayer containing eicosane has the phase transition from LE phase to LC phase and the protrusions are squeezed out from the monolayer, below the phase transition. On the other hand, eicosane changes the isotherm from mouse lung surfactant less dramatically than that of DPPC. The addition of increasing amounts of eicosane to mouse surfactant increases surface compressibility at 30 mN/m during the second compression, suggesting that the deposition of alkane-rich nanoparticles onto pulmonary surfactants may be related to dysfunction of surfactant activity during breathing.",

Eicosane is a component of petroleum products and may be released into the environment through the processing and combustion of petroleum products containing this chemical. Eicosane is detected in various plant parts and tissues. Eicosane's production and use in the manufacture of cosmetics, lubricants, and plasticizers may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.621X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates eicosane will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase eicosane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 hours. Particulate-phase eicosane will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Eicosane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, eicosane is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 5.9X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 90 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Eicosane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 89% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks. Additionally, eicosane achieved 6 to 27% biodegradation after 28 days in sediment and marine-water inoculums and has a calculated half-life of 2.8 days in unacclimated pond-water. These data indicate that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, eicosane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.8 hours and 7.1 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is greater than 2 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 94 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to eicosane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where eicosane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to eicosane via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and dermal contact with water contaminated by combustion effluents. The greatest potential for dermal and inhalation exposure is expected during use of petroleum products containing eicosane.(SRC)",

Vapor-phase eicosane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.52X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase eicosane may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Eicosane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

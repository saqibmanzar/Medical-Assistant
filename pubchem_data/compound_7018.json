ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to the atmosphere, anthrone will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere based on an estimated vapor pressure of 1.8X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase anthrone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 40 hours. An estimated Koc of 2300 suggests that anthrone will have only slight mobility in soil. Volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces should not be a major fate process for this compound. Based on limited data, this compound may biodegrade in both soil and water. In water, anthrone is expected to adsorb to sediment and suspended matter based on its Koc value. Anthrone may volatilize slowly from water surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.9X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 65 and 480 days, respectively. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms may occur based on an estimated BCF value of 360. The general population may be exposed to this compound by ingestion of contaminated drinking water and inhalation of aerosols containing anthrone. (SRC)",

Biodegradation of anthrone is expected based on limited data and may be a major fate process for this compound in soil(SRC). A mixed bacterial population, isolated from a hydrocarbon-polluted creek, degraded 40% of anthrone to traces of anthrone and to anthraquinone in 30% yield(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This value indicates that anthrone will slowly volatilize from water surfaces(2,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 65 days(2,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 480 days(2,SRC). Anthrone's values for vapor pressure(3) and Henry's Law constant(1,SRC) indicate that volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces is not likely to be a major fate process for this compound(SRC).",

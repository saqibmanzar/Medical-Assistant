Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Acids tested included 12 unbranched, saturated aliphatics, 12 branched, saturated aliphatics, 12 unsaturated aliphatics, and 9 aromatics. Embryos were collected following hormone-induced breeding and exposed to at least eight concentrations of the acid, along with a control. For each concentration, 25 properly developing embryos were exposed to the acid solution for 96 hr. Each acid was tested on at least three separate occasions and the data were pooled to calculate 96 hr LC50 (lethality). 96 hr EC50 (malformation), and DHI (developmental hazard index = 96 hr LC50/96 hr EC50) values. The endpoint data were subjected to quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analyses and computer-automated structure evaluation (CASE). Variation in acid-induced lethality was effectively explained by partitioning and ionizability of the acids, while partitioning alone was somewhat effective in explaining variation for acid-induced malformation. The results indicated that developmental hazard of the acids to Xenopus embryos is primarily dependent on carbon-chain length, with acids containing five carbon atoms in the chain tending to be the most potent. Unsaturation reduced the hazard in comparison with the corresponding unbranched saturated acid. Developmental hazard was highest for 2-position branched compounds with a 5- or 6-C chain, but was reduced for 2-position branched acids with a 3- or 4-C chain. Hazard of the non-2 position branched acids was variable. Valproic (2-propylpentanoic) acid showed the highest developmental hazard with Xenopus, twice that of any other acid tested.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propiolic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase propiolic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and with ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 5 and 380 days, respectively. Propiolic acid contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, propiolic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. The pKa of propiolic acid is 1.89, indicating that this compound will exist entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Propiolic acid may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, propiolic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The pKa value indicates propiolic acid will exist in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces and moist soil is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to propiolic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propiolic acid is produced or used. (SRC)",

A pKa of 1.89(3) indicates propiolic acid will exist entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -0.19(5) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Propiolic acid is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(7). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2010).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In microsomes, (CS2) metabolism was increased by phenobarbital pretreatment of the rats and decreased with pretreatment of the rats with cobaltous chloride. In both microsomes and hepatocytes, CS2 metabolism was inhibited by SKF-525A. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was the major volatile metabolite of CS2 in hepatocytes, and carbonyl sulfide (COS) was the major volatile metabolite in microsomal incubations. Addition of cytosol to microsomal incubations shifted the predominant volatile metabolite from COS to CO2 but did not change total volatile metabolite formation. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, significantly decreased COS metabolism but not CS2 metabolism in isolated hepatocytes or microsomes fortified with dialyzed cytosol. When [(18)O]H2O was included in incubations of microsomes and CS2, a substantial portion of the resulting COS was [(18)O] enriched.",

CSIRO and BOC have agreed to commercialize ethanedinitrile (EDN) and carbonyl sulfide (COS) as alternatives for methyl bromide which is being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. EDN will initially be targeted to soil timber and devitilization of grain application in the label submitted with the registration data while COS is targeted to fumigation of durables. Applications targeting quarantine issues are being developed and will be added to the label as accepted by quarantines authorities. Data for registration was submitted in June 2005 to the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) and the process is progressing. Negotiations for the supply of both fumigants are underway. BOC plan on introduce these alternatives, initially into the South Pacific market, to satisfy the needs of growers, fumigators and producers who have been willing to participate in the development phase. The driver for this has been due to problems being experienced with many of the current replacements for methyl bromide.",

CSF is ideal for the investigation of markers of brain injury or disease since it is secreted from several central nervous system structures and changes in the CSF composition may reflect brain insult and many pathological processes. Animals were placed in exposure chambers and were exposed to 0 ppm or 500 ppm COS for 1, 2 or 3 days, 6 hr per day. After the last inhalation exposure, 50-70 uL CSF sample was obtained by lumbar puncture. CSF samples were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) on either a Premier quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) or an Agilent 6340 ion trap and by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS on a 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF analyzer. The dynamic range of abundance of the identified proteins spanned over more than three orders of magnitude. The four most abundant proteins identified (albumin, cystatin C, serotransferrin, transthyretin) are major proteins that are present in both CSF and blood at high levels but the fifth most abundant protein identified (prostaglandin H2D isomerase) is the second most abundant protein in human CSF and is secreted and synthesized in the rat central nervous system. No significant differences were observed between COS-treated CSF samples and the control CSF samples because of blood contamination. Quantitative MS protein analyses of rat CSF is limited by the low sample volumes that can practicably be obtained from rats and the low protein concentrations in rat CSF ...",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

                                "Description": "Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPGs) are air concentration guidelines for single exposures to agents, developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

In rats exposed to 500 or 600 ppm for up to 4 days, malacia and microgliosis were detected in numerous neuroanatomical regions of the brain by conventional optical microscopy and magnetic resonance microscopy. After a 2-week exposure to 400 ppm slight gait abnormality was detected in 50% of the rats and hypotonia was present in all rats. Continuous exposure of rabbits to approximately 50 ppm carbonyl sulfide for 7 weeks slightly elevated the mean serum cholesterol concentration. Serum triglyceride concentration was largely unaffected. Carbon sulfide is neither genotoxic nor a developmental toxicant but does reversibly impair male fertility. A decrease in pregnancy rate was observed in unexposed female rats mated with male rats exposed to 182 ppm carbonyl sulfide 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 10 weeks and 6 hours/day, 7 days/week for a 3-week mating period. When the males were allowed to recover for 10 weeks prior to mating to unexposed females, no alterations in fertility were observed. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: In insects, carbonic anhydrase has a key role in toxicity of carbonyl sulfide.",

In microsomes, (CS2) metabolism was increased by phenobarbital pretreatment of the rats and decreased with pretreatment of the rats with cobaltous chloride. In both microsomes and hepatocytes, CS2 metabolism was inhibited by SKF-525A. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was the major volatile metabolite of CS2 in hepatocytes, and carbonyl sulfide (COS) was the major volatile metabolite in microsomal incubations. Addition of cytosol to microsomal incubations shifted the predominant volatile metabolite from COS to CO2 but did not change total volatile metabolite formation. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, significantly decreased COS metabolism but not CS2 metabolism in isolated hepatocytes or microsomes fortified with dialyzed cytosol. When [(18)O]H2O was included in incubations of microsomes and CS2, a substantial portion of the resulting COS was [(18)O] enriched.",

Keissler genes that are differentially expressed; these genes were cloned using suppression subtractive hybridization. Changes in the levels of transcripts of 79 fragments were confirmed by microarray analysis and qRT-PCR. Further homology search revealed that they are highly homologous to 41 genes of other fungi, which were related to general metabolism, growth and division, defense, cellular transport, and signal transduction.

Here we explored the affinity of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase for its natural substrate CO(2), as well as COS and CS(2) (1) by in vitro kinetic metabolism studies using pure enzyme and (2) through mortality bioassay of insects exposed to toxic levels of each of the gases during carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Hydrolysis of COS to form hydrogen sulfide was catalyzed rapidly showing parameters K(m) 1.86 mM and K(cat) 41 s(-1) at 25 degrees C; however, the specificity constant (K(cat)/K(m)) was 4000-fold lower than the reported value for carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed hydration of CO(2). Carbonic anhydrase-mediated CS(2) metabolism was a further 65,000-fold lower than COS. Both results demonstrate the deactivating effect toward the enzyme of sulfur substitution for oxygen in the molecule. We also investigated the role of carbonic anhydrases in CO(2), COS and CS(2) toxicity using a specific inhibitor, acetazolamide, administered to Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) larvae via the diet. CO(2) toxicity was greatly enhanced by up to seven-fold in acetazolamide-treated larvae indicating that carbonic anhydrases are a key protective enzyme in elevated CO(2) concentrations. Conversely, mortality was reduced by up to 12-fold in acetazolamide-treated larvae exposed to COS due to reduced formation of toxic hydrogen sulfide. CS(2) toxicity was unaffected by acetazolamide. These results show that carbonic anhydrase has a key role in toxicity of the substrates CO(2) and COS but not CS(2), despite minor differences in chemical formulae.",

Its former use in the US as a grain fumigant resulted in its direct release to the environment. Carbonyl sulfide may be released to the atmosphere from deciduous trees, volcanoes, coniferous trees, salt marshes and soils. It may also be released to the environment as a fugitive emission from commercial processes and combustion emissions. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.41X10+3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates carbonyl sulfide will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase carbonyl sulfide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 22 hours. Carbonyl sulfide did not absorb UV light at environmental wavelengths >290nm and, therefore, photolysis in the troposphere is negligible. If released to soil, carbonyl sulfide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.61 atm-cu m/mole. Carbonyl sulfide may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, carbonyl sulfide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to carbonyl sulfide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where carbonyl sulfide is produced or used. Carbonyl sulfide is ubiquitous in the atmosphere. Monitoring data indicate that the general population will be exposed to carbonyl sulfide via inhalation of ambient air and smoking cigarettes.

Total biogenic and anthropogenic output to the atmosphere can be estimated at 3 millions tons(1). Emissions of carbonyl sulfide have been associated with deciduous trees, coniferous trees, salt marshes and soils(2). The mean carbonyl sulfide emissions from a hardwood forest were 8.66 ug S/day and 19.86 ug S/day from a pine forest; the emission rate increased dramatically after the addition of fertilizer(3). The average emission of carbonyl sulfide from 5 different soil types was found to range from 0.0014 to 6.36 g S/cu m-yr(4).",

The compounds were sampled by cryogenic technique and measured by subsequent gas chromatography/flame photometric detector analysis. Besides soil type, soil temperature is a major factor controlling carbonyl sulfide source strength. The emission of carbonyl sulfide does not show any clear dependence upon soil moisture, its fraction is about 35 to 40% of the total emission at all sampling sites. Dimethyl sulfide and carbonyl sulfide were the predominant gases emitted from organic soils. Carbonyl sulfide maximum emission rates reached 50 ng sulfur/sq m/min. Measurements of the diurnal variations of emission rates show daily patterns of dimethyl sulfide and carbonyl sulfide emission rates which coincide with the soil temperature curve. Sulfur fluxes of carbonyl sulfide from soil treated with liquid manure were enhanced by a factor of 5 to 6 compared to unfertilized soil of the same type(1).",

Carbonyl sulfide may also be formed in the atmosphere by the gas-phase reaction of carbon disulfide and photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals(2). Carbonyl sulfide was identified in the emissions of volatile sulfur-containing compounds from flue gas desulfurization sludge field storage sites.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The average concentration of carbonyl sulfide in the waste gas from two different shale oil retorting facilities were 394 ppm and 13 ppm(2). It was identified, not quantified, in one out of sixty-three effluent samples obtained from a wide range of chemical manufacturing plants in the USA(3). The tropospheric burden of carbonyl sulfide is estimated as 28 teragrams sulfur per year (Tg S/yr)(4). Estimated emissions of carbonyl sulfide from anthropogenic sources are 0.20 Tg/yr (range 0.4-0.15 (Tg/yr) from biomass burning and 0.06 Tg/yr (0.01-0.3 Tg/yr) from automobiles, chemical industries and sulfur recovery processes(5). Carbonyl sulfide concentration in biogas ranged from <1 to in Nov and Dec 2000 to 3, 9 and 2 g/cu cm in Feb, May 2001 and May 2002, respectively, from a biogas production plant in Linkoping, Sweden. Emissions prior to upgrade range from <1 to 1190 g/cu m(6). The compound as included in a sulfur compounds class was reported in gaseous emissions inside an unspecified mechanical biological treatment plant for municipal solid waste located in China. It was not detected in outdoor samples. The plant has a 1200 t/day capacity(7).",

COS is a tracer with which to quantify terrestrial photosynthesis based on the coupled leaf uptake of COS and CO2, but such use requires separating soil COS flux, which is unrelated to photosynthesis, from ecosystem COS uptake. For CO, soil is a significant natural sink that influences the tropospheric CO budget. In the boreal forest, magnitudes and variabilities of soil COS and CO fluxes remain poorly understood. We measured hourly soil fluxes of COS, CO, and CO2 over the 2015 late growing season (July to November) in a Scots pine forest in Hyytiala, Finland. The soil acted as a net sink of COS and CO, with average uptake rates around 3 pmol-sq m/sec for COS and 1 nmol-sq m/sec for CO. Soil respiration showed seasonal dynamics controlled by soil temperature, peaking at around 4 umol-sq m/sec in late August and September and dropping to 1- 2 umol-sq m/sec in October. In contrast, seasonal variations of COS and CO fluxes were weak and mainly driven by soil moisture changes through diffusion limitation. COS and CO fluxes did not appear to respond to temperature variation, although they both correlated well with soil respiration in specific temperature bins. However, COS:CO2 and CO:CO2 flux ratios increased with temperature, suggesting possible shifts in active COS- and CO-consuming microbial groups. Our results show that soil COS and CO fluxes do not have strong variations over the late growing season in this boreal forest and can be represented with the fluxes during the photosynthetically most active period. Well-characterized and relatively invariant soil COS fluxes strengthen the case for using COS as a photosynthetic tracer in boreal forests(1).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A SUBLETHAL DOSE OF VINYL SULFONE INCR BLOOD BUN & DECR URINARY OUTPUT WHILE PRODUCING NO EFFECT ON SGOT & SGPT ACTIVITY OR ON HEMATOCRIT VALUES IN RATS. THESE DATA INDICATE THAT THE TOXICITY OF VINYL SULFONE IS NOT RELATED TO INHIBITION OF ENDOGENOUS RESP IN EITHER SNAILS OR RATS. IT WAS POSTULATED THAT THE TOXICITY OF SUBLETHAL DOSES OF VINYL SULFONE IS CAUSED BY IMPAIRMENT OF NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION.",

These cmpds, including acrylamide, several acrylate & methacrylate esters, vinyl sulfones, & phorone, have been evaluated using TK+/- -3.7.2C mouse lymphoma cells. Mutagenic chemicals induced increases in the number of small colony tk- deficient mutants. This suggested a clastogenic mechanism which was confirmed by demonstrating increases in aberrations & micronucleus frequencies in cultured cells. Vinyl sulfone was found to be the most effective chemical mutagen with induction of genotoxic effects at concns as low as 0.25 ug/ml. The other cmpds also produced positive results, but at higher concns. Since these cmpds are known to deplete glutathione, phorone, a model glutathione depleter, was examined & found to produce similar effects as the other cmpds in mouse lymphoma cells. These results suggest that the direct-acting Michael-type reaction has activity relevant to producing a genotoxic effect. Since acrylamide has been found to be a potent germ cell mutagen, this mechanism may be also relevant in the induction of heritable mutagenic risk.",

Vinyl sulfone also may be formed during the chemical decontamination of mustard gas and released during this process to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.06 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates vinyl sulfone will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase vinyl sulfone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone molecules; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 7 hours and 3 days, respectively. If released to soil, vinyl sulfone is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 20. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.9X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Under anaerobic conditions in soil or sediment, vinyl sulfone may be microbially reduced to the sulfide. If released into water, vinyl sulfone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc value. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 and 10 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to vinyl sulfone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where vinyl sulfone is produced or used or at locations where mustard gas is decontaminated.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Vinyl sulfone may also react with atmospheric ozone with an estimated rate constant for this reaction of 3.5X10-18 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) using a structure estimation method(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(1). Vinyl sulfone is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). Vinyl sulfone may undergo direct photolysis because it absorbs light in the environmental UV spectrum(3), but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This study examined the influence of methyl groups on the velocity and stereochemical course of enzymatic benz(a)anthracene (BA) trans-dihydrodiol oxidation. The racemic trans-3,4-dihydrodiols of BA and 7-methylbenz(a)anthracene (7-MBA) were completely consumed by the purified dehydrogenase, indicating that both stereoisomers are substrates. However, 50% of the ( +/- )-trans-3,4-dihydrodiols of 12-methylbenz(a)anthracene (12-MBA) and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)-anthracene (DMBA) were oxidized, suggesting that only one stereoisomer is utilized in each case. At low substrate concentrations, enzymatic oxidation of the trans-3,4-dihydrodiols of BA, 12-MBA, and DMBA followed simple first-order kinetics. By contrast, oxidation of the 3,4-dihydrodiol of 7-MBA was of higher order, due to differences in the rate of oxidation of each stereoisomer. Rate constants estimated for each reaction indicate that the non-bay-region methyl group at position 7 has a greater enhancing effect on the rate of oxidation than the bay-region methyl group at position 12 (10- versus 4-fold, respectively). The 3,4-dihydrodiol of DMBA, which possesses both non-bay- and bay-region methyl groups, is oxidized more than 30 times faster than the unmethylated parent hydrocarbon. The absolute stereochemistry of the preferentially oxidized dihydrodiols was assigned by circular dichroism spectrometry. For the 3,4-dihydrodiols of DMBA and 12-MBA, the stereoisomer oxidized has the 3S,4S configuration. A large negative Cotton effect was observed in the circular dichroism spectrum of the 7-MBA 3,4-dihydrodiol which remained at the end of the rapid phase of oxidation of this racemic substrate, indicating that the dehydrogenase displays partial stereochemical preference for the 3S,4S enantiomer. These results suggest that methylation of BA at C-7 greatly enhances the oxidation of the 3S,4S-dihydrodiol, while the presence of a bay-region methyl group at C-12 completely blocks the oxidation of the 3R,4R-stereoisomer. Rapid, stereoselective oxidation of methylated polycyclic aromatic trans-dihydrodiols by this route in vivo may significantly influence their carcinogenicity.",

These results support the hypothesis that for most, if not all, unsubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogens, the chemical or biochemical introduction of an alkyl group in the meso-anthracenic position(s) or L-region is a structural requirement for strong carcinogenic activity. Here we report that the L-region methyl derivatives 7-MBA, 12-MBA and 7,12-DMBA are oxidized to hydroxymethyl derivatives by a rat liver cytosol preparation without any apparent oxidation of the ring positions.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation. Dataset: the integrated content containing the transformation information. Source: the entity or group that compiled the dataset containing the transformation information.",

Initially, the electrochemical oxidation of DMBA at the glassy carbon and pencil graphite electrodes in non-aqueous media (dimethylsulphoxide with lithium perchlorate) was studied by cyclic voltammetry. DMBA was irreversibly oxidized in two steps at high positive potentials, resulting in the ill-resolved formation of a couple with a reduction and re-oxidation wave at much lower potentials. Special attention was given to the use of adsorptive stripping voltammetry together with a medium exchange procedure on disposable pencil graphite electrode in aqueous solutions over the pH range of 3.0-9.0. The response was characterized with respect to pH of the supporting electrolyte, pre-concentration time and accumulation potential. Using square-wave stripping mode, the compound yielded a well-defined voltammetric response in acetate buffer, pH 4.8 at +1.15 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) (a pre-concentration step being carried out at a fixed potential of +0.60 V for 360 s). The process could be used to determine DMBA concentrations in the range 2-10 nM, with an extremely low detection limit of 0.194 nM (49.7 ng/L). The applicability to assay of spiked human urine samples was also illustrated. Finally, the interaction of DMBA with fish sperm double-stranded DNA based on decreasing of the oxidation signal of adenine base was studied electrochemically by using differential pulse voltammetry with a pencil graphite electrode at the surface and also in solution. The favorable signal-to-noise characteristics of biosensor resulted in low detection limit (ca. 46nM) following a 300-s interaction. These results displayed that the electrochemical DNA-based biosensor could be used for the sensitive, rapid, simple and cost effective detection of DMBA-DNA interaction.",

A new and simple high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with diode-array detection at 290 nm was developed and validated for monitoring of DMBA in different matrices (serum, liver and kidney) of rats orally treated with DMBA. Furthermore, the applicability of adsorptive transfer stripping voltammetry (AdTSV) on the pencil-lead graphite electrode to these samples was illustrated using our previously reported data for bulk aqueous solutions of DMBA. HPLC and AdTSV methods, which were compatible with each other, allowed DMBA to be detected down to the levels of 3.82x10-9 M (0.98 ppb) and 6.73x10-9 M (1.73 ppb), respectively. Olive oil solutions of DMBA in dose 50 mg/kg were orally administered. 60 days after a single dose of DMBA, its concentrations in these biological samples from rats were measured by means of both methods. Because of rapid biotransformation, DMBA could not be detected in serum. Only low levels of the compounds were deposited unchanged in kidney whereas its levels were considerably higher in liver. These methods were also applied to the assay whether there is an influence of the intake of aqueous extracts of Hypericum Perforatum L. plant on the parent DMBA levels accumulated in rat tissues.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

It is used mainly as a research chemical in experimental medicine. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: 7,12-DMBA is one of the most powerful synthetic carcinogens. In humans, it may be an initiator when applied to the skin. Low mutagenic effects were noted for DMBA when tested in human cell cultures with metabolic activation, but practically no effects were noted when tested without activation. ANIMAL STUDIES: After 50-day-old female rats were fed DMBA at either 112 or 133 mg/kg body wt, pancytopenia accompanied by severe depression of hematopoietic and lymphoid precursors developed within weeks. Weekly intravenous injection of DMBA produced dermal melanocytomas and tumors of the forestomach, intestine, ovary, skin subcutis, and lymphoreticular tissue in the Syrian hamster. DMBA admin in single ip doses of 80 mg/kg in corn oil destroyed primordial oocytes in mouse ovaries. DMBA, significantly enhances the overall embryotoxicity in avian species. In rodent cell tests, nonactivated DMBA exhibits weak and activated DMBA moderate mutagenic effects. It also causes sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations. Mammalian cell transformation tests for DMBA were slightly positive with metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Groups of at least 145 guppies (6 to 11 days old) of the king cobra strain (Poecilia reticulata) were exposed for 6 hours each week for 4 weeks to DMBA. Hepatic neoplasms developed in guppies exposed to the intermediate and high concentration. In addition to liver neoplasms, several other types of lesions developed in DMBA exposed guppies.",

In the tenth week they went through a skin biopsy and histopathological study. The average thickness of the epidermis was calculated and evaluated statistically. Macroscopic lesions in group B were more of inflammatory kind compared to group A. Group C presented more injuries with neoplastic features than the others (p<0.01). Histologically there was a significant increase in thickness of the epidermis of all groups compared to control, however the greatest thickness measures occurred in Group C (p<0.01). The population exposed to ultraviolet B radiation is subject to suffer skin lesions that can develop into cancer. The association with hydrocarbons as the dimethyl benzanthracene increases the possibility of malignancy. ...",

Spanish black radishes (SBR) contain 4x more glucosinolates than other crucifers. This study examined whether feeding mice a diet containing 20% SBR for 2 wk could enhance metabolism of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and inhibit DMBA-mediated bone marrow toxicity. Expression of Phase I and II detoxification enzymes was significantly greater for mice fed SBR than control diet. Six hours after DMBA administration, the blood levels of DMBA in mice fed the SBR diet were significantly lower than mice fed a control diet. DMBA reduced bone marrow cells in mice fed control diet to a significantly greater extent than mice fed the SBR diet. Colony forming assays demonstrated that mice on the SBR diet had 1) less reduction in lymphoid CFU-preB progenitor cells, 2) greater recovery of CFU-preB progenitor cells at 168 hr, and 3) less reduction of CFU-GM progenitor cells at 6 hr. Therefore, mice fed a 20% SBR diet for 2 wk had greater expression of detoxification enzymes, faster metabolism of DMBA, and a reduction in DMBA-induced bone marrow toxicity. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that glucosinolates in SBR are protective against acute toxicity.",

Recombinant (bacterial) CYP1A1 was slightly more active than any of four CYP1B1 allelic variants, CYP1B1*1, CYP1B1*2, CYP1B1*3, and CYP1B1*6, in catalyzing activation of chrysene-1,2-diol, benz[a]anthracene-trans-1,2-, 3,4-, 5,6-, and 8,9-diol, fluoranthene-2,3-diol, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, benzo[c]phenanthrene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene and several arylamines and heterocyclic amines, whereas CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 enzymes had essentially similar catalytic specificities toward other procarcinogens, such as (+)-, (-)-, and (+/-)-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol, 5-methylchrysene-1,2-diol, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene-11,12-diol, benzo[b]fluoranthene-9,10-diol, benzo[c]chrysene, 5,6-dimethylchrysene-1,2-diol, benzo[c]phenanthrene-3,4-diol, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, 5-methylchrysene, and benz[a]anthracene. We also determined activation of these procarcinogens by recombinant (T. ni) human P450 enzymes in S. typhimurium NM2009. There were good correlations between activities of procarcinogen activation by CYP1A1 preparations expressed in E. coli and T. ni cells, although basal activities with three lots of CYP1B1 in T. ni cells were very high without substrates and NADPH in our assay system. Using 14 forms of human P450s (but not CYP1B1) (in T. ni cells), we found that CYP1A2, 2C9, 3A4, and 2C19 catalyzed activation of several of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at much slower rates than those catalyzed by CYP1A1 and that other enzymes, including CYP2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C18, 2D6, 2E1, 3A5, 3A7, and 4A11, were almost inactive in the activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons examined here.",

Benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene and benz[a]anthracene gave a positive mutagenic response only in the presence of activation systems derived from the hamster. With the exception of the pig, activation systems derived from all animal species could convert 3-methylcholanthrene to mutagens, the hamster being the most efficient. With the exception of the rat and pig, all animal species activated 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene to mutagens, the human preparation being the most effective followed by the hamster and mouse. Dibenz[a,h]anthracene was not activated by any of the hepatic preparations. It is concluded that, among the animal species studied the hamster is generally the most efficient in activating polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to mutagens in the Ames test.",

Prolactin levels in LE hooded and SD rats were similar at ages 62 and 93 days, whereas estradiol levels were considerably lower in the LE strain at the early age only. After chronic restraint of SD rats, corticosterone levels were unaffected whereas estradiol levels increased and prolactin levels decreased. The low levels of estradiol, indicative of delayed maturation in the LE rats at the time of DMBA exposure, might be the cause of the resistance of the strain to DMBA-induced tumors. The effects of stress might be mediated by increased levels of estradiol and decreased levels of prolactin in the stressed rats.",

The present study attempts to explore whether P53 or the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 are potential targets of DMBA in its induction of breast tumors in the Sprague-Dawley rat breast tumorigenesis model. Our results indicate that the DBMA-induced tumors are apparently the result of P53 inactivation. This inactivation results in tumorigenesis, probably aided by the absence of Bcl-2 in the tumor cells of the Sprague-Dawley rat animal model. ...",

Simultaneous exposure to 25% (w/v) postmitochondrial supernatant from the liver of aroclor-induced rats potentiated metabolism of any promutagens to their active forms in treated bacterial cultures. Following 2-hour incubation, the treated colonies were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and plated either with or without 50 ug/ml 8-azaguanine for selective and non-selective determination of mutagenicity. A mutant fraction was quantitatively defined as the number of treated colonies of a selective culture relative to number of colonies of the permissive culture, adjusted for dissimilar dilutions in respective assays. Exposure to a concentration of 25 uM 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene for 2 hours was associated with significantly induced mutant fraction resistance to 8-azaguanine (0.44 relative mutagenic activity relative to that of benzo(a)pyrene, the positive control).

Treatment groups included: (1) untreated control; (2) dimethylformamide carrier control; (3) low, water mediated DMBA concn (about 1 to 3 ug/L or ppb DMBA); (4) intermediate, dimethylformamide mediated DMBA concn (about 20 ppb DMBA); and (5) high, dimethylformamide mediated DMBA concn (about 35 ppb DMBA). Hepatic neoplasms developed in guppies exposed to the intermediate and high concn. Both of these exposure media contained the same concn of soluble DMBA. The high exposure medium, however, also contained an insoluble, particulate fraction of DMBA. Hepatic neoplasm incidences in fish exposed to the intermediate concn were 10% (7/71 fish) at 24 wk and 19% (12/62) at 37 wk after initial exposure. In samples from the high concn group, 47% (35/74) had hepatic neoplasms at 24 wk and 46% (23/50) at 37 wk. Histologically, the hepatic lesions were categorized as altered foci, hepatocellular adenomas, and hepatocellular carcinomas. At the high dose, adenomas represented 40% (14/35) of the hepatocellular neoplasms after 24 wk, and 70% (16/23) after 36 wk. Carcinomas, occurring only at the high dose, were found in 9% of the fish (2/23). In addition to liver neoplasms, several other types of lesions developed in DMBA exposed guppies. These included two undifferentiated sarcomas, a rhabdomyosarcoma, a renal adenocarcinoma, and a neurilemmoma. Only one control specimen (representing 0.38% of all controls) had a neoplastic lesion, a small hepatocellular adenoma in a 37 wk specimen.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.8X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.4 hours. Particulate-phase 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene is expected to have no mobility based upon a mean Koc of 235,700. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. PAHs with four or more rings, such as 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation. The degradation half-life for 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene applied to Kidman sandy loam and McLaurin sandy loam was determined to be 20 days and 28 days, respectively. If released into water, 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene was not degraded in 6 days in a standard BOD test using an activated sludge inoculum. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 120 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 3,100 suggests that the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene is produced or used as a research chemical.

However, volatilization from soil surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to soil(SRC). 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(SRC). PAHs with four or more rings, such as 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation(5). The degradation half-life for 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene applied to Kidman sandy loam and McLaurin sandy loam was determined to be 20 days and 28 days, respectively(6). 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and therefore is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure 6.8X10-7 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 0.061 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 120 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is >10 years if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3,100(SRC), using a log Kow of 5.80(8) and a regression-derived equation(9) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(10). PAHs with four or more rings, such as 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation(11). In a standard BOD test using an activated sludge inoculum, 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene was not degraded in 6 days(12). After 62 days in an enclosed marine ecosystem, 12% of the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene had been respired to CO2 and about 18 percent could be extracted from sediments(13). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Photooxidation via singlet oxygen is possible in natural waters(14).",

Vapor-phase 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.4 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.6X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Within 12 hours after the addition, 95 percent of the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene was photodegraded(1). Parent C14-labeled 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene biodegraded extensively (20 to 62 percent) in a nonacclimated sandy loam soil after 14 days. 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene was transformed into the metabolic products 4-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, and 10-hydroxy-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and 7,12-dihydro-12-methyl-7-methylene-benz(a)anthracene-12-ol(2). The percent of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene removed from Kidman sandy loam and McLaurin sandy loam after 48 hours of incubation was determined to be 13.3 and 12.0, respectively(3). The degradation half-life for 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene applied to Kidman sandy loam and McLaurin sandy loam was determined to be 20 days and 28 days, respectively(3). There was no statistically significant abiotic loss in soil by PAH compounds containing greater than 3 aromatic rings in soil(3). Degradation due to photolysis was not examined(3). Under conditions which singlet oxygen was generated in natural waters obtained from the southern United States in mid-winter, it was estimated that the half-life for dissolved 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene in Okefenokee Swamp water was 6 hours(4).",

Based on UV absorption of benz(a)anthracene(2), 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Solar spectrum irradiation converts 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene to a variety of photoproducts including epoxides, diones and other degradates(3). PAHs can photodegrade in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone, other oxidants, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides(1). Photodecomposition in aqueous environments is influenced by water depth, turbidity, solar radiation intensity, temperature and dissolved oxygen(1). In general, singlet oxygen is the major oxidant and the products include quinones(1). When a quartz flask containing 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene was suspended in estuarine water in an outside tank for 2 days, 0.3% was mineralized in 18 hours(4). Mineralization only occurred when the flasks were exposed to light and mercuric chloride was not added to kill microorganisms. This indicated that photochemically produced intermediates, which include monohydroxyl derivatives and diones, were biodegraded to form CO2. The photo-product, benzo(a)anthracene 7,12-dione, was identified in the experiment(4). It was determined that non irradiated 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene adsorbed on coal fly ash did not decompose(5).",

According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(4). Using a database of measured fish biotransformation half-lives of PAHs(5), a fish biotransformation half-life of 1.2 days has been estimated for 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene(2). In laboratory studies, sea bass (Dicentrachus labrax) showed only minor bioaccumulation of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene while mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) did bioaccumulate the compound(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 16 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 120 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is >10 years if adsorption is considered(4). 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). However, volatilization from soil surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to soil(SRC). 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

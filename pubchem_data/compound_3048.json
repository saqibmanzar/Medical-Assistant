PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Explosive limits specify the concentration range of a material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an ignition source. There are two types of explosive limits: lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL). The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

Hypertension (high blood pressure), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), and cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heart beating) may be noted. Respiratory depression may lead to respiratory arrest. Contact with the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes may result in redness and irritation. Victims often have an elevated temperature.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Endrin is found on List B. Case No: 2250; Pesticide type: insecticide, rodenticide; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): Hexachloroepoxyoctahydro-endo, endo-dimethanonapthalene; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

This results in the accumulation of intracellular free calcium ions, which promotes release of neurotransmitters from storage vesicles, the subsequent depolarization of adjacent neurons, and the propagation of stimuli throughout the central nervous system. Endrin also causes increased lipid peroxidation, decreased membrane fluidity, and DNA damage in hepatocytes, but the exact mechanism is unknown. (T10, L112)",

The inadequacies of the several bioassays call into question the strength of the reported negative findings.

Levels of both (14)C-labeled endrin and 3H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane were monitored in serum, gall bladder, and whole bodies during pre- and post-exposures to each cmpd. in mosquitofish. Dichloro diphenyltrichloroethane for 4 hr generally reduced (14) C-labeled endrin accumulation in serum, gall bladders and whole bodies, whereas prior exposure to (14)C-labeled endrin exerted little effect on (3)H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane accumulation. Simultaneous exposure to 3H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane and (14) C-labeled endrin reduced (3)H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane accumulation in the gall bladder at all times and in the whole body during the first 2 hr; (14)C-labeled endrin accumulation was generally reduced in the gall bladder and whole body. (14) C-labeled endrin levels in fish exposed subsequently to only (3)H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane or 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethene were significantly higher in the gall bladder at all times after 0.5 hr and were reduced in the whole body at all times tested, compared to fish exposed subsequently only to uncontaminated water. The insecticide interactions observed may be the result of competition for and/or displacement of insecticides from mutual binding sites.",

Oils should not be used as either cathartics or dermal cleansing agents, as they increase absorption. Gastric lavage and use of activated charcoal and sodium sulfate are indicated for ingestion. If dermal exposure occurred, contaminated clothes should be removed, and the skin should be thoroughly cleansed with soap and water. Management of seizures in both children and adults is with diazepam or phenobarbital. Respirator depression and even respiratory arrest especially with concomitant use of diazepam and phenobarbital in children, may occur. These drugs preferably should be used only in critical care areas where emergency endotracheal intubation can be performed. ... Epinephrine can not be utilized in patients with organochlorine poisoning, as the organochlorines induce myocardial irritability and ventricular arrhythmias may occur. However, dopamine may be necessary in the event of hypotension unresponsive to fluid administration, and epinephrin may be necessary in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest. ... In a critically ill patient with unknown insecticide exposure ... . Atropine must be used with caution, as it can cause ventricular irritability, especially when a myocardial irritant such as an organochlorine is present. ... Hematologic, hepatic (especially with endrin, which is markedly hepatotoxic), and renal studies as well as cardiopulmonary monitoring should be carried out in acute intoxication from lindane or other organochlorines for at least 48 to 72 hr. Long term hematologic follow-up is necessary for the patient with lindane intoxication. As the carrier for these agents may be xylene or a petroleum distillate, management also must include observation and treatment for these entities. /Organochlorine pesticides/",

Groups of 50 rats of each sex were admin one of two doses of endrin for 80 wk, then observed for 31 to 34 wk. The doses used for the male rats were 2.5 or 5 ppm. The initial doses of 5 or 10 ppm used for the females were not well tolerated and were reduced during the study. The time weighted avg doses used for the females were 3 or 6 ppm. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 rats of each sex; pooled controls, used for statistical evaluation, consisted of the matched control groups combined with 40 untreated male and 40 untreated female rats from similar bioassays of other test chemicals. All surviving rats were /sacrificed/ at 110 to 114 wk. Groups of 50 mice of each sex were admin endrin at one of two doses for 80 wk, then observed for 10 or 11 wk. Initial doses of 2.5 or 5 ppm were used for the males were not well tolerated and reduced during the study. The time weighted avg doses used for the males were 1.6 and 3.2 ppm; the doses used for the females were 2.5 or 5 ppm. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 mice of each sex; pooled controls, used for statistical evaluation, consisted of the matched control groups combined with 50 untreated male and 50 untreated female mice from similar bioassays of other test chemicals. All surviving mice were /sacrificed/ at 90 or 91 wk. ... Although survival of the high dose male mice at the end of the study was markedly lower than that of controls, the survivals of the low and high dose female mice and female and male rats were unaffected by endrin. The survival of the low dose male mice could not be evaluated, due to accidental admin of excessive quantities of endrin to this group during wk 66. ... In rats, the combination of adenomas and carcinomas of the adrenal occurred at the following incidence: males: pooled controls 2/44, matched controls 2/9, low dose 4/46, high dose 8/44; females: pooled controls 4/46, matched controls 3/9, low dose 16/49, high dose 7/47. These incidence did not show consistent statistical significance. ... In mice, no tumors occurred in dosed groups at incidence that were significantly higher than those in pooled or matched controls. It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, endrin was not carcinogenic for Osborne-Mendel rats or B6C3F1 mice.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3X10-6 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates endrin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase endrin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Endrin will also photodegrade to ketoendrin with an isomerization half-life of about 7 days. Particulate-phase endrin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, endrin is expected to have no mobility based upon an average Koc value of 11,420. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole; however, adsorption may attenuate this process. The volatilization half-life of endrin from a sugarcane soil was reported as 63 days. Endrin is generally considered recalcitrant, with a reported half-life of about 4 to 8 years in soils. If released into water, endrin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the Koc data. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be severely attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 and 89 days, respectively if adsorption is neglected. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 13 years when adsorption is considered. Biodegradation of endrin in water is expected to be very slow. Less than 20% degradation occurred for endrin in canal water over a 16 week incubation period. The hydrolysis rate of endrin is very slow, with an estimated half-life of 12.8 years at pH 7. BCF values of 4,860 to 14,500 measured in fish, suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Although endrin is no longer registered for agricultural use in the US, the general population continues to be exposed to this compound due to its long persistence time. Oral ingestion of food is the primary source of exposure for the general population. Ingestion of contaminated drinking water, inhalation of contaminated air and dermal contact with contaminated soil surfaces are also possible routes of human exposure. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be severely attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 and 89 days, respectively if adsorption is neglected(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 13 years when adsorption is considered(5). The volatilization half-life of endrin in laboratory experiments using distilled water was reported as 5.33 days(6). The hydrolysis rate of endrin is very slow, with an estimated half-life of 12.8 years at pH 7(7). Less than 20% degradation of endrin was observed when it was incubated in water obtained from a drainage canal in Ontario, Canada over 16 weeks(2), suggesting biodegradation in water is very slow. According to a classification scheme(8), BCF values of 4,860 to 14,500(9) measured in fish, suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC).",

Vapor-phase endrin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC). The half-life for the reaction with hydroxyl radicals is estimated to be 2 days(SRC) calculated from its rate constant of 9.2X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Endrin will also undergo direct photolysis in the atmosphere(4). Endrin exposed to sunlight for 12 days in glass panchets isomerized to ketoendrin in yields of 30% in October and 65% in June(4). The isomerization half-life was reported as 7 days for June(4). Particulate-phase endrin may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Greater than 80% of endrin was recovered from sterilized and unsterilized natural water (drainage canal of Holland Marsh, Ontario, Canada) and distilled water after 16 weeks(1). No degradation of endrin observed - Little Miami River water, 8 weeks(2). Soil biodegradation half-lives of approximately 4 to 8 years(3) and 14 yrs(4) or more(5) have been reported. Considerable degradation (51% - 4 days in Rutledge sand to essentially 100% in Magnolia sandy loam) has been reported(6); however, biodegradation was not conclusively proven to be the degradation route nor were the products identified(6). After 2 months endrin recovery in flooded (anaerobic) Casiguran soil was only 8.4% while 88.24% was recovered in the upland (aerobic) soil(7); endrin persisted in all other soils for 2 months(7). Endrin, present at 100 mg/l, reached 0 percent of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test(10). The half-life for endrin in soil under aerobic conditions was reported as 4,300 days(11). ANAEROBIC: Anaerobic conditions apparently stimulate biodegradation of endrin, although it remains persistent(8). The half-life in thick anaerobic sewage sludge is 5-14 days with 4 unidentified products observed(9).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 8 days if adsorption is neglected(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 89 days if adsorption is neglected(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 13 years when adsorption is considered(3). Endrin's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur; however adsorption is expected to attenuate this process(SRC).

The volatilization half-life of endrin in laboratory experiments using distilled water was reported as 5.33 days(5).",

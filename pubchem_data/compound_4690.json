The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Methazole is found on List B. Case No: 2400; Pesticide type: Herbicide; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): 2-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazolidine-3,5-dione; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 05/10/91; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

If released to the atmosphere, chlormethazole will degrade rapidly in the vapor phase by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (half-life of about 15.6 hr). Particulate phase chlormethazole and aerosols released to air during applications of chlormethazole herbicides will be removed from air physically by dry and wet deposition. If released to soil or water, chlormethazole may degrade through photodecomposition, biodegradation and aqueous hydrolysis. The results of degradation studies in different soil types found that chlormethazole degraded readily to 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-methyl urea; the degradation mechanism was not examined, but the degradation product is known to be a major degradation product resulting from aqueous hydrolysis or photodecomposition. Soil microorganisms can reportedly degrade chlormethazole, but the relative importance of biodegradation in soil or water is unknown. The US Dept of Agric's Pesticide Properties Database lists a soil half-life of 14 days for chlormethazole. Chlormethazole does not leach readily. Occupational exposure to chlormethazole occurs through dermal contact and inhalation of sprays, especially to workers applying the compound as a herbicide. (SRC)",

Soil microorganisms can reportedly degrade chlormethazole to its major metabolites (including DCPMU)(3), but the relative importance of biodegradation in soil is unknown(SRC). The US Dept of Agric's Pesticide Properties Database lists a soil half-life of 14 days for chlormethazole(4). Chlormethazole applied to soil at agricultural rates degrades quickly and generally disappears within 30 to 60 days(3). Soil column leaching tests(1) and a measured Koc value of 2620(5) indicated that chlormethazole will leach very little in most soils(SRC). Chlormethazole will reportedly volatilize from inert surfaces, but much less so from foliar surfaces(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

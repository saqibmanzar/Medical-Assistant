PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.09 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethylene glycol dibutyl ether will exist solely in the vapor phase in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethylene glycol dibutyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 hours. If released to soil, ethylene glycol dibutyl ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 17. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, ethylene glycol dibutyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.9 and 39 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 16 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to ethylene glycol dibutyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethylene glycol dibutyl ether is produced or used.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

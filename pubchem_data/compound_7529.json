When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Vinyl toluene is used in the coatings industry as a modifier for drying oils and oil-modified alkyds. It is also used as a replacement for styrene in unsaturated polyester resins where high-temperature cures and little shrinkage are desired. HUMAN STUDIES: Central nervous system effects, such as depression, poor memory, slow visuomotor performance and electrophysiological changes, have often been associated with heavy occupational exposure to vinyl toluenes. Contact allergy to styrene related compounds was studied in a human subject. A patient known from previous studies to be sensitive to styrene was patch tested with styrene and 18 compounds structurally related to styrene. Positive results were obtained with 3-methylstyrene. Vinyl toluene induces sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes. ANIMAL STUDIES: Specific depletion of brain dopamine levels has been described in rabbits. In male rats exposed by inhalation to up to 300 ppm vinyl toluene (60-70% meta and 30-70% para isomer) for a maximum of 15 weeks, decreased motor conductivity velocity was observed within 12 weeks. In 2-year inhalation studies (mixed isomers: 65%-71% meta and 32%-35% para), there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male or female rats exposed to 100 or 300 ppm vinyl toluene and no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male or female mice exposed to 10 or 25 ppm.  There was evidence of chemical-related toxicity to the nasal passage in both rats and mice. Vinyl toluene did not induce gene mutations in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without exogenous metabolic activation. Vinyl toluene was positive in the mouse lymphoma assay for induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y/TK cells in the absence of metabolic activation. Vinyl toluene did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells with or without metabolic activation. Vinyl toluene increased the frequency of micronuclei in mouse bone-marrow erythrocytes in vivo.",

                                                    "String": "/HUMAN EXPOSURE STUDIES/ Contact allergy to styrene related compounds was studied in a human subject. A patient known from previous studies to be sensitive to styrene was patch tested with styrene and 18 compounds structurally related to styrene. Positive results were obtained with 2-methylstyrene, 3-methylstyrene, 4-methylstyrene, styrene-epoxide, and 4-hydroxystyrene. The reaction to styrene-epoxide was stronger than that obtained by patch testing with an equimolar concentration of styrene, 0.1 percent weight per volume in ethanol. Twenty one comparisons were subsequently patch tested with styrene-epoxide. All responses were negative. The authors note that the stronger reaction to styrene-epoxide, as compared to an equimolar concentration of styrene, may indicate that styrene-epoxide is the hapten and styrene is the prohapten, which has to be oxidized in the skin in order to be converted into styrene-epoxide. Styrene-epoxide can be formed from styrene by enzymatic transformation by aryl-hydrocarbon-hydroxylase in the skin. They conclude that it is important to patch test with chemically related substances in order to evaluate the total sensitivity pattern of a patient.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-vinyltoluene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-vinyltoluene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 12 and 13 hours, respectively. 3-Vinyltoluene absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-vinyltoluene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 720. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.0X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 3-Vinyltoluene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, 3-vinyltoluene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 hours and 4.4 days, respectively. A BCF of 35 reported in goldfish suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 3-vinyltoluene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-vinyltoluene is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population is not likely to be exposed to 3-vinyltoluene. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 hours and 4.4 days, respectively(SRC). 3-Vinyltoluene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

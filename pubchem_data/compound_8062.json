When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

Though the bulk of the material was still liquid, heating to 195 C did not clear the line, and shortly afterwards decomposition occurred. It was subsequently found that the distillation residue had also decomposed at 175 C, 2 hours after distillation ended. Differntial thermal analysis showed that the nitrile is unusual in that no heat is evolved during the induction period of around 33 hours/200 C, or 1.5 hours/280 C, and the rapid onset and narrow peak width suggested a self-accelerating decomposition process, with Q = 700 J/g. No stabilising additives period for the nitrile to 20 percent of its value, while 1 percent of potassium cyanide reduced it to 2 percent.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In the in vivo studies, male rabbits weighing 2-3 kg and male rats weighing 400-450 g were administered succinonitrile in iv doses of 25-40 mg/kg and 25-50 mg/kg, respectively. Levels of cyanide and thiocyanate were determined in samples of urine from rabbits and rats. The total number of rats that were studied was not mentioned. In the in vitro studies, levels of cyanide and thiocyanate were determined in liver slices and homogenates of rat or rabbit liver or with isolated mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble fractions. Samples (0.1-2.0 mL) of filtered 24 hr urine output were collected form groups of two rats and from each rabbit pre- and post-administration with succinonitrile to determine thiocyanate concentrations. In another study, rats were pretreated with 2 mL/kg of carbon tetrachloride sc 48 hr prior to succinonitrile administration. Filtered urine samples were collected, and cyanide concentrations were determined colorimetrically. ...A sixfold increase in urinary thiocyanate following iv-injected doses of 25 mg/kg of succinonitrile /was found/ compared with the controls. Forty-eight to 120 hours postadministration of succinonitrile, thiocyanate levels approached control values. Pretreatment of rats by sc injection of 2 mL/kg carbon tetrachloride inhibited urinary thiocyanate excretion. Urinary excretion of cyanide increased over fivefold 48 hours posttreatment with succinonitrile. The values at 72-120 hours posttreatment approached normal values. ...Rat and rabbit liver slices catalyzed the release of cyanide from succinonitrile. However, 0.1-2.0 mg/g of Triton-X-100 strongly inhibited cyanide release from succinonitrile in rat liver slices. Liver slices of rats pretreated with carbon tetrachloride did not release detectable amounts of cyanide for succinonitrile. .../It was/ concluded that rabbits and rats converted about 60% of the administered succinonitrile to cyanide, which was excreted as thiocyanate. The release of cyanide was inhibited by carbon tetrachloride and Triton-X-100. The authors also postulated that disruption of the liver cells, as by centrifugation to separate their contents, depressed or eliminated their ability to liberate cyanide ions or to form thiocyanate. The authors proposed that cellular membranes contain enzymes or enzyme complexes that are responsible for the conversion of succinonitrile to cyanide, which is excreted as thiocyanate. However, following homogenization, these enzyme or enzyme complexes may be destroyed or damaged by homogenization.",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

Two hours after the last injection, the patient began vomiting and showed signs of psychomotor agitation and mental confusion accompanied by cold sweating. He was admitted to a hospital with convulsions and mental disorientation. The patient died 2 hours after he was hospitalized during a convulsion. Autopsy showed pronounced visceral congestion and cerebral and pulmonary edema. Histological examination showed a massive and vacuolar hepatic degeneration and a significant nephrosis of the tubules. Because of the odor of bitter almonds when the skull was opened, a chemical analysis for cyanide compounds was conducted. Cyanide concentrations of 0.265 to 1.500 mg/100 mL, reported as potassium-cyanide, were found in the liver, brain, kidney, lungs, and urine. No evidence of cyanide was found in the blood or gastric contents. An ampule of the pharmaceutical product containing the succinonitrile was analyzed. No trace of cyanide was found. .../It was concluded/ that death was due to cyanide poisoning, the cyanide having accumulated in the body as a result of a metabolic disorder when succinonitrile was administered.",

Succinonitrile's production and use may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.00778 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates succinonitrile will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. The reaction of vapor-phase succinonitrile with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on the estimated half-life for this reaction in air of 380 days. Succinonitrile is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight, since it does not contain functional groups that are expected to absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm. If released to soil, succinonitrile is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 28. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.1X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Succinonitrile is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. In studies with activated sludge, biodegradation of 1.5-3.8% was observed after 6-24 hours. These studies suggest that succinonitrile may have been toxic to the microorganisms, since a high concentration of succinonitrile was used. If released into water, succinonitrile is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to succinonitrile may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where succinonitrile is produced or used. (SRC)",

The reaction of vapor-phase succinonitrile with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals is not expected to be an important environmental fate based on the estimated half-life for this reaction in air of 380 days, calculated from its rate constant of 4.3X10-14 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg (SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Succinonitrile is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight, since it does not contain functional groups that are expected to absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

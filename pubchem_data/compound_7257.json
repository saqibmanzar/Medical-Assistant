When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

The 3,4-dichloroaniline formed was extracted with 10 ml of benzene. The emulsion containing benzene & 3,4-dichloroaniline was centrifuged & the solvent layer was injected onto the gas chromatograph. The limit of detection was 0.1 ug of 3,4-dichloroaniline in 1 ml of urine, & an average recovery of 91% was achieved when 3,4-dichloroaniline was present at 5 ug/ml of urine.

Whole liver homogenates from adult Holtzmann rats, Charles River mice, & guinea pigs were incubated with 3,4-DCA, a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-generating system, & heparinized rat blood (which served as the source of hemoglobin (Hb), the reactant with the active metabolite of 3,4-DCA). The activity was measured in terms of methemoglobin formed using a spectrophotometric procedure. Livers from mice & guinea pigs were about equally active in producing the methemoglobin forming metabolite, while rat liver was less effective. Sex differences in liver capacity to activate DCA were not observed in mice nor guinea pigs. Male rat livers were significantly more active than female rat livers. Results agree with those of another study which utilized N-hydroxylation of p-chloroaniline by liver microsomes from guinea pigs, mice, & rats. Heparinized rat blood is preferred in the assay because it has a lower methemoglobin-reductase activity than guinea pig or mouse blood.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.32X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3,4-dichloroaniline will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3,4-dichloroaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours. 3,4-Dichloroaniline absorbs UV light (ranging from 254 nm to 400 nm) in the ambient environment and is expected to undergo photolysis. If released to soil, 3,4-dichloroaniline is expected to have moderate mobility based upon a Koc of 195. When released to soil, 3,5-dichloroaniline may undergo covalent chemical bonding with humic materials, which can result in its chemical alteration to a latent form and tight adsorption. When covalently bound in this latent form, leaching in soil systems is not generally expected to occur. This covalent bonding proceeds in two steps; a rapid and reversible bonding followed by a slower and much less reversible reaction. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.46X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 3,4-Dichloroaniline is not expected to undergo significant biodegradation. After 119 days at 20 \u00b0C, 2.1% of 3,4-dichloroaniline was decomposed in incubated crop soil. If released into water, 3,4-dichloroaniline is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. In a biodegradation study of 3,4-dichloroaniline in pond water, 97% of initial 3,4-dichloroaniline remained in the pond water after 14 days of incubation. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 28 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. A BCF of 30.2 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to 3,4-dichloroaniline may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3,4-dichloroaniline is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 3,4-dichloroaniline via ingestion of drinking water and contact with dyes, pharmaceutical, and pesticide products containing 3,4-dichloroaniline. (SRC)",

IN THESE EXPT, METABOLISM WAS MEASURED BY THE CARBON DIOXIDE RELEASED BY ALL MICROORGANISMS IN A QUANTITY OF SOIL OVER TIME. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT WHEN ANILINE-BASED HERBICIDES SUCH AS PROPANIL WERE APPLIED TO THE SOIL, THIS SOIL RESPIRATION FIRST INCREASED & THEN DECREASED. IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT PROPANIL WOULD BE DEGRADED BY SOIL MICROORGANISMS TO PROPIONIC ACID & 3,4-DICHLOROANILINE (DCA). WHEN THESE TWO COMPOUNDS WERE TESTED ON SOIL, IT WAS FOUND THAT DCA DECREASED SOIL RESPIRATION, AN OBSERVATION THAT DEMONSTRATED THE TOXICITY OF DCA TO SOIL MICROORGANISMS. THE DCA CONCENTRATION INCREASED FOR 5 DAYS & THEN SLOWLY DECREASED. DCA, ITSELF UNDERWENT CHANGE, WHICH WAS MANIFESTED BY THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW CHROMATOGRAPHIC PEAK THAT INCREASED IN AMPLITUDE THROUGHOUT A 30-DAY OBSERVATION PERIOD. THIS WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE AZO COMPOUND, 3,3',4,4'-TETRACHLOROAZOBENZENE. AT LEAST 10 OTHER MORE COMPLEX COMPOUNDS ALSO RESULTED FROM THE BREAKDOWN OF DCA.",

THE CATABOLIC ENZYMES WHICH DEGRADED 3,4-DICHLOROANILINE TO CO2 WERE INDUCIBLE BY 4-CHLOROANILINE AND BY 3,4-DICHLOROANILINE, BUT THEIR ACTIVITY WAS MUCH LOWER ON 3,4-DICHLOROANILINE THAN ON 4-CHLOROANILINE. THE STRAIN SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT GROWTH ON 3,4-DICHLOROANILINE AS A SOLE SOURCE OF CARBON AND NITROGEN.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 17 hours at an atmospheric concn of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 3,4-Dichloroaniline is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). It is expected to directly photolyze due to absorption in the environmental UV spectrum(4,5). Absorption of solar radiation by 3,4-dichloroaniline at midday, midsummer at latitude of 40 deg N was greatest at 317 nm in water(4). The half-life of 3,4-dichloroaniline under these same conditions was 3 hrs(5). A photo irradiation half-life of about 8.7 hr was observed when an aqueous solution of 3,4-dichloroaniline was exposed to UV light of 300-400 nm spectra(6). The major direct photolysis products of 3,4-dichloroaniline in distilled water is 2-chloro-5-aminophenol (>78% conversion) and 3-chloroaniline. Although overall photolysis rates are slower in natural water than in distilled water due to light attenuation, rates are faster in natural water than expected based on the amount of light being received(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Aromatic amines, including 3,4-dichloroaniline, have been observed to undergo rapid and reversible covalent bonding with humic materials in aqueous solution. The initial bonding reaction is followed by a slower and much less reversible reaction believed to represent the addition of the amine to quinoidal structures followed by oxidation of the product to give an amino-substituted quinone(3).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 3,4-dichloroaniline is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as approximately 80 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as approximately 28 days(SRC). However, this model underestimates the volatilization half-life of 3,4-dichloroaniline since it does not take into account the effects of adsorption. The Koc value of 195(2) suggests that volatilization could be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediments in water(SRC). This is apparent from the results of two EXAMS model runs, one in which the effect of adsorption was considered (half-life = 56 days in a model pond) and one in which adsorption was ignored (half-life = 36 days in a model pond)(4). 3,4-Dichloroaniline's estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 3,4-Dichloroaniline is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 6.32X10-3 mm Hg(1).",

Rice grain was collected at maturity from plants grown in Stuttgart, AR, which had been treated with 4 lb/acre of propanil in the 2-leaf stage. Brown head rice samples were purchased commercially. The control sample of Nato rice was reared under glasshouse conditions. The grain samples were ground to a coarse flour for analysis. Colorimetric analysis indicated the presence of aromatic amines in the field rice cereal. Gas liquid chromatography showed no chlorine peaks in the glasshouse grown rice samples, but revealed chlorine peaks in the samples from treated & untreated plants from Stuttgart, as well as commercial brown & white rice samples. DCA equal to 1.7, 1.4, 1.1 & 0.5 mcg propanil/g of grain was found in rough & polished treated samples & rough & polished untreated samples, respectively.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to the atmosphere, 3-chloro-2-methylphenylamine is expected to degrade rapidly (estimated half-life of 3.2 hr) by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. If released to soil, 3-chloro-2-methylphenylamine may undergo a covalent chemical bonding with humic materials which can result in its chemical alteration to a latent form and prevent leaching. In the absence of covalent bonding, moderate leaching may be possible. If released to water, covalent bonding with humic materials in the water column and sediments may result in partitioning from the water column to sediments. By analogy to similar aromatic amines, 3-chloro-2-methylphenylamine in the water column may be susceptible to photooxidation (via hydroxyl and peroxy radicals) and direct photolysis. Insufficient data are available to assess the relative importance of biodegradation of 3-chloro-2-methylphenylamine in soil or water. Occupational exposure occurs primarily through dermal contact, although exposure through inhalation can also occur. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

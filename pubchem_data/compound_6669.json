ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The dose was applied evenly over an area of 9 sq cm. The application rate was 0.01 mg/sq cm ... After 6 hr application the dressing and foil were removed and the remaining dose at the treated area was wiped off ... In the bile duct cannulated CD rats only 1.8% of the dose was eliminated in the urine in 48 hours, while 25.3% was collected in the bile (of which 15.8% within 24 hours). The non-cannulated rat excreted 8% of the dose in the urine in 48 hours. These results indicate that the predominant route of excretion for (14)C-musk ketone is via the bile, and therefore that most of the radioactivity in the urine of cannulated animals is due to material that had been reabsorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract. In bile, at least six drug-related components were present as beta-glucuronic acid conjugates which were apparently deconjugated and further metabolized in the gastro-intestinal tract to other more polar components, some of which were at least partially reabsorbed giving rise to a complex profile of urinary metabolites. Radioactivity was detected in nearly all the tissues of animals killed at 1-120 hours after start of dose application. Concentrations were highest at about 6 hours after start of dosing in all tissues. Between 8 and 120 hr the concentration of radioactivity declined steadily in all tissues so that at 120 hours after start of dosing the concentration of radioactivity in each tissue was in general less than 20% of its peak value. Throughout the study the highest concentrations of radioactivity were found in the gastro-intestinal tract, liver, adipose tissue, adrenals, thyroid and kidneys, which at 6 hours after start of dosing contained means of 0.645 ug musk ketone equivalents/g, 0.32 ug/g, 0.19 ug/g, 0.12 ug/g, 0.10 ug/g and 0.08 ug/g, respectively, in CD rats. The distribution of radioactivity in the tissues of Long-Evans rats was similar with the highest peak concentrations of radioactivity at 6 hr after start of dosing in the gastro-intestinal tract (0.47 ug musk ketone equivalents/g), liver (0.26 ug/g), adrenals (0.1 ug/g), thyroid (0.18 ug/g) and fat (0.16 ug/g).",

The skin remained unrinsed between the applications. Two rats were killed for whole-body autoradiography, one 24 hours after the first dose, and the other 24 hours after the 14th dose. From the remaining 8 rats, urine and feces were collected at several time points, and at sacrifice samples of blood, treated skin, brain, kidney, liver, thyroid, and fat were taken. Whole-body autoradiography showed that at 24 hours after the first dose radioactivity was not widely distributed throughout the body. Relatively high concentrations were present at the site of application and in the caecal contents, large intestine contents, and bile ducts. Lower levels were present in the small intestine contents and liver. Tissues of the rat killed at 24 hours after the 14th dose generally contained more radioactivity, although the highest concentrations were still associated with the site of application and the gastro-intestinal tract and lower levels were present in liver, blood, and thyroid. Hence, the absorption of radioactivity was incomplete, given the large amounts of the applied radioactivity remaining at the site of application. Means of 1.48 and 2.34 ug musk ketone equivalents were excreted in urine and feces, respectively, in the 24 hours following the application of dose 1. The mean rate of excretion in the urine increased to 6.54 ug/day during the 24 hours following the application of dose 14. The mean rate of excretion in feces increased to maxima of about 14.8 ug/day in the 24 hours following application of both dose 12 and dose 14. At sacrifice, the concentration of radioactivity in treated skin was high, whereas the total radioactivity present in blood and selected tissues was only a very small proportion of the total of 14 applied doses (0.22-0.37% in liver, and even less in fat, blood, kidneys, brain, and thyroid).",

The in vivo analysis of musk xylene (MX) and musk ketone (MK)-protein adducts in trout liver has been performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using selected ion monitoring (GC-SIM-MS). Biotransformation, dose-response and toxicokinetics studies of 2-amino-MX (2-AMX), 2-amino-MK (2-AMK) and 4-amino-MX (4-AMX) metabolites, covalently bound to cysteine amino acids in proteins in fish liver, formed by enzymatic nitro-reduction of MX and MK, have been described. Trout were exposed to single exposures of 0.010, 0.030, 0.10, and 0.30 mg/g MX and/or MK. Forty-two fish liver samples were collected from exposed- and control-fish subsequent to exposure intervals of 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days and were composited as per exposure schedules and times. Alkaline hydrolysis released bound metabolites from exposed liver composites that were extracted into n-hexane and then concentrated and analyzed by GC-SIM-MS. The presence of the metabolites in liver extracts was confirmed based on agreement of similar mass spectral properties and retention times with standards. In the dose-response study, the maximum adduct formation was 492.0 ng/g for 2-AMX, 505.5 ng/g for 2-AMK and 12588.5 ng/g for 4-AMX in liver at 0.03 mg/g MX and MK fish in 1 day after exposure. For toxicokinetics investigation, the highest amount of the target metabolites was found to be the same concentration as observed in the dose-response study for 1 day after exposure with 0.03 mg/g MX and MK fish and the half-lives of the metabolites were estimated to be 2-9 days based on assumption of first-order kinetics. Average recoveries exceeded 95% with a relative standard deviation (RSD) around 9%, and the limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 0.91 to 3.8 ng/g based on a signal to noise ratio of 10 (S/N=10) could be achieved for the metabolites. No metabolites were detected in the controls and exposed non-hydrolyzed liver extracts. This is the first report on dose-response and toxicokinetics of nitro musk-cysteine-protein adducts in fish liver.",

Instrumental calibration (LVI-GC-MS(SIM)) and experimental conditions that could affect the SBSE-LD efficiency are discussed. Assays performed on 30-mL water samples spiked at 200 ng/L under optimized experimental conditions yielded recoveries ranging from 83.7 +/- 8.1% (MK) to 107.6 +/- 10.8% (HHCB). Furthermore, the experimental data were in very good agreement with predicted theoretical equilibria described by octanol-water partition coefficients (K (PDMS/W) approximately = K (O/W)). The methodology also showed excellent linear dynamic ranges for the four musks studied, with correlation coefficients higher than 0.9961, limits of detection and quantification between 12 and 19 ng/L and between 41 and 62 ng/L, respectively, and suitable precision (< 20%). Application of this method for analysis of the musks in real water matrices such as tap, river, sea, and urban wastewater samples resulted in convenient selectivity, high sensitivity and accuracy using the standard addition methodology. The proposed method (SBSE-LD/LVI-GC-MS(SIM)) was shown to be feasible and sensitive, with a low-sample volume requirement, for determination of musk compounds in environmental water matrices at the ultra-trace level, overcoming several disadvantages presented by other sample-preparation techniques.",

The developed method is based on stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), coated with polydimethylsiloxane, and coupled with a thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system (TD-GC-MS). SBSE can efficiently trap and desorb the analytes providing low limits of detection (between 0.02 ng/L and 0.3 ng/L). Method validation showed good linearity, repeatability and reproducibility for all compounds. Furthermore, the limited manipulation of the sample required in this method implies a significant decrease of the risk of external contamination of the samples. The performance of the method in real samples was evaluated by analyzing biological wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent samples, reverse osmosis treatment plant effluents and river waters. The most abundant musk was galaxolide with values up to 2069 ng/L and 1432 ng/L in the influent and effluent of urban WWTP samples, respectively. Cashmeran, Pantolide and Tonalide were also detected in all the matrices with values up to 94 ng/L, 26 ng/L and 88 ng/L, respectively. Although in Europe the use of nitromusks in cosmetics is prohibited, musk xylene and musk ketone were detected both in the WWTP and in the river samples. As far as we know, this is the first time than a SBSE method coupled with TD is applied for the determination of synthetic musks in water samples.",

Apart from the optimization of the different variables affecting MEPS (i.e., nature of the sorbent, nature of the solvent elution, sample load, and elution/injection volume) extraction recovery was also evaluated, not only for water samples but also for environmental water matrices such as estuarine and waste water. The use of two deuterated analogs ([(2)H3]-AHTN and [(2)H15]-MX) was successfully evaluated in order to correct matrix effect in complex environmental matrices such as influent samples from wastewater treatment plants. Method detection limits (MDLs) ranged from 5 to 25 ng/L, 7 to 39 ng/L and 8 to 84 ng/L for influent, effluent and estuarine samples, respectively. Apparent recoveries were higher than 75% for all target compounds in all the matrices studied (estuarine water and wastewater) and the precision of the method, calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD), was below 13.2% at 200 ng/L concentration level and below 14.9% at low level (20 ng/L for all the target analytes, except for AHTN which was set at 40 ng/L and HHCB at 90 ng/L, due to the higher MDL values presented by those target compounds). Finally, this MEPS procedure was applied to the determination of the target analytes in water samples, including estuarine and wastewater, from two estuaries, Urdaibai (Spain) and Adour (France) and an established stir-bar sorptive extraction-liquid desorption/large volume injection-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SBSE-LD/LVI-GC-MS) method was performed in parallel for comparison. Results were in good agreement for all the analytes determined, except for DPMI.",

Good analytical performances were obtained for all the target compounds. For the validation of the method, internal calibration (IC) and internal calibration with QuEChERS (ICQ) were compared. Good linearity was obtained for both calibration methods with determination coefficients (R2) ranging between 0.990 for Musk Xylene (MX) and 0.999 for Tonalide (AHTN) with IC and between 0.991 for Musk Ketone (MK) and 0.999 for Traseolide (ATII) with ICQ. The repeatability ranges were 0.1%-1.9% with the IC and 0.1%-2.6% with the ICQ. The apparent recoveries obtained for SMs in the standard reference sediment (SRM1944) varied in the range of 70%-98% and 75%-103% in the sediment from the Bizerte Lagoon (Tunisia). The absolute recoveries ranged between 61% and 92% for the SRM1944 and between 61% and 89% in the sediment from the Bizerte Lagoon. The limits of detection (LOD) calculated for the two main compounds, Galaxolide (HHCB) and Tonalide (AHTN) were 0.3 and 0.1 ng/g respectively. The LODs obtained for ADBI (Celestolide), AHMI (Phantolide), ATII (Traseolide), MM (Muks mosken), MK (Musk Ketone) and MX (Musk Xylene) were 0.08, 0.12, 0.03, 0.34, 0.11, 0.08, 0.10 and 0.15 ng/g respectively. The levels of sigmaSMs in surface sediments from the Bizerte Lagoon ranged from 1.4 to 4.5 ng/g, which are 1000 times lower than the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) for marine organisms.",

Musk ketone is widely used as a fixative in blossom and fantasy compositions. HUMAN STUDIES: Musk ketone failed to elicit a sensitization reaction after 48 and 72 hours in a maximization test with human volunteers. A case described patient with chronic actinic dermatitis whose photopatch tests revealed reactions to musk ketone and musk ambrette, both of which were found in his aftershave lotion. Musk ketone at doses of 0.068 to 68 uM did not induce sister chromatid exchanges in human lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation. In an in vitro micronucleus test, musk ketone at doses up to 136 and 250 uM did not increase the frequency of micronuclei in human lymphocytes and in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2, respectively. ANIMAL STUDIES: Musk ketone did not produce dermal irritation or systemic toxicity in rabbits. It was a mild eye irritant in rabbit's eyes. Musk ketone did not produce contact sensitivity in guinea pigs. Musk ketone treatment in mice resulted in dose-related increases in relative liver weight at dose levels of 50 mg/kg bw, up to 50% at 500 mg/kg bw. Musk ketone also caused histological changes in the liver, primarily centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, and at the highest dose panlobular hepatocellular hypertrophy. Pregnant rats received by gavage 0, 60, 200, 600 or 2,000 mg musk ketone/kg bw/day during days 7-17 of gestation. Observations after caesarean sectioning showed decreases in fetal body weights, litter sizes and live fetuses and increases in early and late resorptions and percent resorbed conceptuses at 200 mg/kg bw and higher. No gross external fetal alterations were observed. Musk ketone negatively affects reproduction and early life-stage survival in zebrafish. Musk ketone was tested in 5 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and found to be negative with and without activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Cytochromes P450 are potentially sensitive targets of synthetic musk substances in fish."

After 24 hours of contact the patches were removed under dim light and the skin examined for any signs of contact-dermatitis. Half of the contact sites were covered again and the other half was irradiated with ultra-violet light. All persons studied showed a photoallergic reaction to musk ambrette. In one person also a photoallergic reaction to musk ketone was observed. No reaction was seen at the non-irradiated site.

Pretreatment with musk ketone resulted in a significant increase in B(a)P-induced micronuclei. This amplification of B(a)P genotoxicity was seen with 500-5,000 ng/mL musk ketone, concentrations that were effectively inducing CYP1A-activities (as was shown by EROD measurements in the Hep G2 cells), i.e. enzymes playing a key role in the activation of B(a)P.",

The dose was applied evenly over an area of 100 sq cm. The application rate was 0.02 mg/sq cm. The treated area was covered with protective gauze held in position with adhesive tape. After 6 hours, the dressing was removed from the test area and the treated skin was wiped. Blood, urine and feces were collected up to 120 hours after start of dosing. After 120 hours the treated area of the skin was stripped with adhesive tape. All samples (including strips, dressing and swabs) were analyzed for radioactivity. The (14)C-musk ketone was poorly absorbed from the skin during the 6-hr application since only 0.5% of the dose was excreted in urine and feces during 120 hours, and approximately 86% of the dose was recovered from the site of application. Moreover, no radioactivity was detected in any of the plasma or whole blood samples or in the skin strips. When urine samples of one of the volunteers from the study above were extracted with ethyl acetate the recovery of the radioactivity was low (about 12%). When urine samples were treated with beta-glucuronidase and extracted with ethyl acetate the recovery was about 5-fold larger, indicating that a large proportion of the metabolites of musk ketone in human urine were present as glucuronide conjugates. Extracts of beta-glucuronidase treated human urine contained a single major (unidentified) metabolite which was probably also present as a minor constituent of rat bile extract.",

The challenge site was pretreated for 1 hour with 10% aqueous sodium lauryl sulfate. Under these conditions, musk ketone failed to elicit a sensitization reaction after 48 and 72 hour.",

After 24 hours of contact the patches were removed under dim light and the skin examined for any signs of contact-dermatitis. Half of the contact sites were covered again and the other half was irradiated with ultra-violet light. All persons studied showed a photoallergic reaction to musk ambrette.

Inductions were performed using 0.1 mL of 10% musk ketone in dimethylacetamide/acetone/ethanol 4:3:3 for 25 minutes on an area of 900 sq mm that had been defined by 4 x 0.1 mL injections of /Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA)/. After 25 minutes excess substance was removed and the guinea pigs were irradiated with 100 kJ/sq m UV. This procedure, excluding injection of adjuvant, was repeated 24 hours later. Ten to 14 days after induction the guinea pigs were challenged using clipped and shaved lumbar skin with 0.1, 1 or 10% musk ketone. Thirty minutes later the animals were irradiated with 100 kJ/sq m UV. After irradiation the test substance was applied to fresh skin sites to check for contact sensitivity. Reactions in skin were observed up to 72 hours. A second, confirmatory, challenge was performed one week later. Photo-cross-reaction to the known photoallergen musk ambrette was studied at the third challenge stage, using 1% concentrations of each substance. There were no reactions after the first challenge at concentrations up to 10%. After the second challenge only one animal in both the 10 and 1% dose groups, but none at 0.1%, showed a photoallergic reaction. There was no contact sensitivity, and musk ketone did not photo-crossreact with musk ambrette.",

The increased detection of these substances in the aquatic environment and their high bioconcentration potential raises concerns about potential effects on aquatic species. This work aimed at assessing the interactions of the most widely used musks: nitromusks (musk xylene, musk ketone) and polycyclic musks (celestolide, galaxolide, and tonalide) with fish enzymatic systems involved in both xenobiotic and endogenous metabolism. Therefore, CYP catalyzed pathways were investigated in carp liver microsomes (CYP1A, CYP3A), ovarian microsomes (CYP19) and testicular mitochondria (CYP17 and CYP11beta) using standard substrates. Phase II activities (UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases) were determined in carp liver microsomes and cytosol, respectively. Polycyclic musks (galaxolide and tonalide) were stronger inhibitors of CYP3A- (IC(50): 68-74 uM), CYP17- (IC(50): 213-225 uM), CYP11beta- and CYP19-catalyzed activities than nitromusks, while the latter showed higher ability to interfere with CYP1A (IC(50): 35-37 uM). The sulfation of estradiol was also significantly inhibited by tonalide and galoxolide (IC(50): 140-294 uM). Overall, polycyclic musks showed the highest potential to interfere with those activities involved in the synthesis and metabolism of steroids while nitromusks mainly interfered with xenobiotic metabolism (CYP1A-catalyzed reactions). The obtained data suggest that CYP isoforms are potentially sensitive targets of synthetic musk substances in fish.",

Furthermore, water samples taken at the effluent of the sewage plant as well as water samples and two series of semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) from the pond were included. This comprehensive data set allowed the determination of species-dependent bioaccumulation factors on a lipid basis (BAF(L)), e.g., for HHCB the BAF(L) in tench were more than 20 times higher than in eel. The BAF(L) for HHCB and AHTN in biota were lower than the partition coefficients K(SPMD/W) obtained from SPMD samples, which are assumed to represent model bioconcentration values. This stresses that metabolism of these compounds in fish must not be neglected.",

Due to their inherent lipophilicity and environmental persistence, they are frequently detected in environmental samples and especially in aquatic ecosystems. ... Although nitromusks have been shown to accumulate in aquatic organisms, little is known about their potential developmental effects in the respective aquatic species. To investigate the developmental toxicity of these compounds to amphibians and fish, early lifestages of xenopus (Xenopus laevis) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to three nitromusks for 96 hr to examine the developmental effects of these compounds in the two species. Nitromusk body concentration measurements were carried out in parallel for correlation with potential developmental effects. No increased mortality, malformation or growth inhibition was observed in either species following 96-hr exposure to 400 ug/L MX, MK and MM. However, an approximately 20% reduced viability was observed in xenopus larvae when exposed to 400 ug/L MX, MK and MM for 11 days. Xenopus and zebrafish exposed to 10, 153, 871 and 1637 ug/L 14C-MX for 96 hr resulted in whole-body concentrations of 0.7 +/- 0.1, 11.1 +/- 1.1, 38.7 +/- 1.9 and 76.3 +/- 18.3 ug/g, and 4.3 +/- 0.6, 73.3 +/- 11.8, 440.0 +/- 72.7 and 664.0 +/- 47.7 ug/g wet body weight, respectively. Exposure of xenopus larvae to 400 ug/L MX, MK and MM for 11 days, resulted in whole body concentrations (extrapolated from gas chromatographic determinations) of 4700 +/- 5000, 1300 + 300 and 4600 + 4800 ug/g wet weight for MX, MK and MM, respectively. The latter toxicity results, in conjunction with the fact that the concentrations used for the above experiments were between 400- and 10000-fold higher than those detected in the environment, suggest that environmental concentrations of nitromusks are not hazardous for early lifestages of fish and amphibians.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.0X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates musk ketone will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase musk ketone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 25 days. Particulate-phase musk ketone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Musk ketone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, musk ketone is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8700. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important, relatively slow, fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.5X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Additionally, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Musk ketone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, musk ketone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 170 days and > 1 year, respectively. A BCF of 1380 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to musk ketone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where musk ketone is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to musk ketone via inhalation. Dermal absorption may play a role after application of musk containing perfumes and cosmetics to the skin or from textiles containing musk fragrance residues from laundry detergents. Exposure may also occur through ingestion of contaminated food. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that musk ketone is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 170 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as greater than 1 year(SRC). Musk ketone's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur relatively slow(SRC). Additionally, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). Musk ketone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

The concentrations of these compounds were around 1 to 10 ng/L in nearshore areas, and the concentrations were lower in the more pristine areas. ... concentrations were ... 0.3 to 3 ng/L fragrance compounds. Some samples from Lake Ontario (Canada) were analyzed in comparison. Per capita emissions were calculated for both regions. These emissions were compared and turned out to be very similar for the Canadian and German locations. For the North Sea, some observations concerning stability, dilution, and degradation, as well as sources of the respective substances, were performed. These data indicate that ... some musk fragrances exhibit half-lives exceeding the residence times and thus can be considered to be persistent in this ecosystem. In the German Bight, the River Elbe is the dominating source for the more hydrophilic compounds, ... for the more lipophilic compounds such as the musk fragrances, different input patterns as well as distribution patterns are relevant, though the River Elbe is still a major source of pollution to the German Bight of the North Sea.

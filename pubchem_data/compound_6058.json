A defect in cystinosin function is followed by cystine accumulation throughout the body, especially the eyes and kidneys.  Several preparations of cysteamine exist for the treatment of cystinosis manifestations, some in capsule form, and others in ophthalmic solution form. In particular, cystine deposits on the eye can cause significant discomfort throughout the day and require frequent treatment with eye drops, typically every waking hour.  On August 25th 2020, the first ophthalmic solution for cystinosis requiring only 4 daily treatments was granted FDA approval.  Cysteamine eye drops are a practical and effective option for those affected by ocular cystinosis.

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Affected patients store 50-100 times the normal amounts of cystine in their cells, and suffer renal tubular and glomerular disease, growth retardation, photophobia, and other systemic complications, including a myopathy and swallowing dysfunction. Using videofluoroscopy and ultrasound examinations, we assessed the swallowing function of 101 patients with nephropathic cystinosis on their most recent admission to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center between 1987 and 2004. These patients ranged in age from 6 to 45 years; more than half had significant complaints of swallowing difficulty. On examination of barium swallow, the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases of swallowing were abnormal in 24%, 51%, and 73% of patients, respectively. The frequency of dysfunction increased with age for each phase of swallowing. Both the Swallowing Severity Score (a measure of dysfunction on barium swallow) and the Oral Muscle Composite Score (a reflection of vocal strength, oral-facial movement, and tongue and lip function) increased (that is, worsened) with the number of years that a patient was not receiving treatment with cysteamine, the cystine-depleting agent of choice in cystinosis. The severity scores decreased with the number of years on cysteamine therapy. The Swallowing Severity Score varied directly with the severity of muscle disease, but was not correlated with the presence or absence of the 57-kb CTNS deletion that commonly occurs in nephropathic cystinosis patients. We conclude that swallowing dysfunction in cystinosis presents a risk of fatal aspiration, correlates with the presence of muscle atrophy, and, based on cross-sectional data, increases in frequency with age and number of years without cysteamine treatment. Cystine-depleting therapy with cysteamine should be considered the treatment of choice for both pre- and posttransplant cystinosis patients.",

Mice administered acetaminophen (500 mg/kg) had elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to 273.0 +/- 37.5 and 555.8 +/- 193.4 U/mL at 12 and 24 h, respectively, after injection. Administration of cysteamine (100 mg/kg) or NAC (500 mg/kg) significantly reduced serum ALT activity (p less than 0.001). Reducing the dose of NAC or cysteamine by 50% greatly reduced their hepatoprotective effect while the co-administration of the reduced doses of NAC (250 mg/kg) and cysteamine (50 mg/kg) following acetaminophen overdose prevented elevation of serum ALT activity (39.2 +/- 1.17 and 32.5 +/- 5.63 U/mL at 12 and 24 h post-injection, p less than 0.001) and preserved normal mouse hepatic histology. Neither NAC (500 mg/kg), cysteamine (100 mg/kg), or the lower doses in combination of both agents were found to alter the half-life or peak levels of acetaminophen. Liver microsomal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity measured 24 h after drug administration was not significantly different between treatment groups and controls receiving only saline. These results indicate a possible role for the concomitant use of NAC and cysteamine in the prevention of hepatic necrosis following toxic doses of acetaminophen. Neither decrease in plasma acetaminophen levels nor depression of cytochrome P-450 enzyme activity appears to be the mechanism of protection when these doses of NAC, cysteamine, or both drugs together are administered with a toxic dose of acetaminophen in mice.",

Moreover, the extent of corneal crystal accumulation reflects the course and severity of the disease itself, and the cornea is accessible to direct examination. Therefore, we employed a scoring system, based on a library of slit-lamp photographs of corneas with increasing crystal densities (0.00-3.00), to assess the degree of crystal accumulation in 170 patients with nephropathic cystinosis examined at the National Institutes of Health between 1976 and 2000. None of the patients had received topical cystine-depleting therapy at the time of the evaluation. In this natural history study, infants in the first year of life had absent or minimal corneal crystals, i.e., a corneal cystine crystal score (CCCS) of 0 or 0.25. However, the CCCS increased linearly with age, such that every patient had visible crystals by 16 months of age, and plateaued at approximately 3.00 by early adolescence. Longitudinal studies in representative patients support the cross-sectional results. Individuals homozygous for the common 57-kb deletion involving the cystinosis gene (CTNS) displayed the same course of corneal crystal accumulation as did individuals not bearing the large deletion. Patients with ocular or nonnephropathic cystinosis had CCCSs that were, in general, half those expected for patients with nephropathic cystinosis of the same age. Administration of 0.55% cysteamine eyedrops, given 6 to 12 times per day, dissolved corneal cystine crystals in 10 representative patients with nephropathic cystinosis aged 1 to 32 years within 8 to 41 months.",

One of the promising strategies to suppress the toxicity of these drugs involves their incorporation into biocompatible polymers. In this study cysteamine (Cy) was attached to poly(oxyethylene phosphate), POEP, via an ionic bond. Radioprotection of E. coli B cells by this substance and its acute toxicity on male C57 BL mice were measured. The toxicity of Cy immobilized within the poly(oxyethylene phosphate) was significantly lower in comparison to pure Cy while its radioprotective efficiency remained high at half the maximum tolerable dose. The high radioprotective efficiency of the Cy/POEP complexes was further confirmed on mice at different polymer molecular weight characteristics, drug immobilization degrees, application times, and doses. It was found that POEP with molecular weight 4700 Da and containing 24% repeating units with attached Cy has the highest protection potential combined with a depot effect.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Blood samples were collected and analysed for plasma cysteamine and white blood cell cystine content and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters estimated by NONMEM analysis using a linked pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Cysteamine was rapidly cleared from the plasma (mean CL/F = 32.3 mL min(-1) kg(-1), range = 17.3-52.2), appeared to be extensively distributed (mean Vss/F = 15.1 l, range 2.7-32.3) and exhibited a mean Tmax of 1.4 hr. White blood cell cystine content post-dosing was significantly decreased compared with pre- and post-dose values (average decrement approximately 47%). A counter-clockwise hysteresis was noted in all patients, suggestive of a lag time (mean Tlag = 0.44 hr, range 0.22-0.92) between drug concentration and effect. The results of this study establish that cysteamine is rapidly cleared from the plasma but that an every 6 hr dosing interval adequately maintains white blood cell cystine content below the target of 1 nmol cystine per mg protein. /Cysteamine bitartrate/",

In this study MEA was compared to phosphocysteamine (MEAP), a phosphorothioester that tastes and smells better than MEA, with respect to its ability to elevate plasma MEA and deplete leukocytes of cystine. Studies were performed in six children with nephropathic cystinosis ranging in age from 2 to 10 yr. After equimolar oral doses of either MEA or MEAP plasma cysteamine was determined at various times for 6 h. MEA was determined by sodium borohydride reduction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography separation and electrochemical detection. Leukocyte cystine was measured before and 1 and 6 h after drug administration. Peak plasma MEA was obtained 30 min to 1 hr after a dose and was not significantly different when MEA (48.6 +/- 10.7, mean +/- SD) or MEAP (54.1 +/- 20.2) was given. Significant plasma MEA concentrations were seen as early as 15 min after an oral dose, indicating rapid absorption. Analysis of vomitus indicated that hydrolysis of the phosphate group of MEAP occurs in the stomach. The percent decrease in leukocyte cystine content obtained with MEA administration (61.9%) was not significantly different from the decrease observed when MEAP was administered (65.3%). MEA and MEAP appear to be equally effective in their cystine-depleting properties.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The cystine crystals may cause considerable damage, particularly in the renal tissues and corneal tissues. In some cases, renal failure can occur during childhood if the condition is left untreated. Other organs that may be affected by cystinosis include the CNS, thyroid, pancreas, muscle tissues, and gonads.   Cysteamine converts cystine to cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfides, reducing the buildup of corneal cystine crystals. This drug participates in a thiol-disulfide interchange reaction with lysosomes, leading to cysteine exit from the lysosome in patients diagnosed with cystinosis.",

These abnormalities were invariably asymptomatic and rapidly reversed with dose adjustment. In addition, patients with cystinosis appear to be at risk for developing nodular regenerative hyperplasia and noncirrhotic portal hypertension. The role of long term cysteamine therapy in these hepatic complications is not clear.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cysteamine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase cysteamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours. Cysteamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, cysteamine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 33. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.6X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. The pKa1 and pKa2 values for cysteamine are 8.19 and 10.75, respectively, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Cysteamine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, cysteamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. The pKa values indicate cysteamine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to cysteamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cysteamine is produced or used. Exposure to cysteamine among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug cysteamine bitartrate. (SRC)",

The pKa1 and pKa2 values for cysteamine are 8.19 and 10.75(5), respectively, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -0.20(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

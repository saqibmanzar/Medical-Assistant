PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The metabolism of HCFC-123a was studied in microsomes of rats, mice, and humans as well as in rats and mice in vivo. Rat, mouse, and human liver microsomes metabolized HCFC-123a to inorganic fluoride and chlorodifluoroacetic acid. Fluoride formation was dependent on time and NADPH, HCFC-123a, and protein concentration. Microsomes from untreated rats oxidized HCFC-123a at low rates (0.49 nmol fluoride/20 min x mg protein). Pretreatment of rats with pyridine and ethanol, inducers of P450 2E1, increased the rates of fluoride release. In mouse liver microsomes, the rates of HCFC-123a oxidation to release fluoride were significantly higher (1.68 nmol fluoride/20 min x mg) than in rat liver microsomes. Incubation of HCFC-123a with microsomes and diethyldithiocarbamate (100 microM), an inhibitor of P450 2E1, reduced fluoride formation by more than 60%. In different samples of human liver microsomes, rates of fluoride formation were between two- and fourfold higher than those observed in liver microsomes from untreated rats. In rats and mice exposed to concentrations of HCFC-123a up to 5000 ppm in a closed recirculating exposure system, chlorodifluoroacetic acid, and inorganic fluoride were identified as urinary metabolites. The biotransformation of HCFC-123a in rats was saturated after exposure to more than 2000 ppm HCFC-123a for 6 hr, whereas no saturation was evident in mice exposed to concentrations of up to 5000 ppm. The obtained results suggest a major role of P450 2E1 in the oxidation of HCFC-123a and in the different capacities for oxidative biotransformation of HCFC-123a in rodents. Mice may thus be more sensitive to toxic effects of HCFC-123a depending on biotransformation after administration of high doses.",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /CFCs and HCFCs/",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /CFCs and HCFCs/",

HCFCs were developed as transitional substitutes for Class I substances and are subject to a later phaseout schedule than Class I substances. ... Although there are currently 34 controlled HCFCs, only a few are commonly used. The most widely used have been HCFC-22 (usually a refrigerant), HCFC-141b (a solvent and foam-blowing agent), and HCFC-142b (a foam-blowing agent and component in refrigerant blends). ... As a Party to the Montreal Protocol, the U.S. must incrementally decrease HCFC consumption and production, culminating in a complete HCFC phaseout in 2030. The major milestones that are upcoming for developed countries are a reduction in 2010 to at least 75 percent below baseline HCFC levels and a reduction in 2015 to at least 90 percent below baseline. Section 605 of the Clean Air Act sets the U.S. phaseout targets for Class II substances. In 1993, the EPA established the phaseout framework and the \"worst-first\" approach that focused first on HCFC-22, HCFC-141b, and HCFC-142b because these three HCFCs have the highest ODPs of all HCFCs. To meet the required 2004 reduction, the EPA phased out HCFC-141b in 2003 and froze the production and consumption of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b. In 2009, EPA reduced the production and import of virgin HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b and limited the use of those compounds to meet the Montreal Protocol's 2010 milestones.",

HCFCs were developed as transitional substitutes for Class I substances and are subject to a later phaseout schedule than Class I substances. ... Although there are currently 34 controlled HCFCs, only a few are commonly used. The most widely used have been HCFC-22 (usually a refrigerant), HCFC-141b (a solvent and foam-blowing agent), and HCFC-142b (a foam-blowing agent and component in refrigerant blends). ... As a Party to the Montreal Protocol, the U.S. must incrementally decrease HCFC consumption and production, culminating in a complete HCFC phaseout in 2030. The major milestones that are upcoming for developed countries are a reduction in 2010 to at least 75 percent below baseline HCFC levels and a reduction in 2015 to at least 90 percent below baseline.  Section 605 of the Clean Air Act sets the U.S. phaseout targets for Class II substances. In 1993, the EPA established the phaseout framework and the \"worst-first\" approach that focused first on HCFC-22, HCFC-141b, and HCFC-142b because these three HCFCs have the highest ODPs of all HCFCs. To meet the required 2004 reduction, the EPA phased out HCFC-141b in 2003 and froze the production and consumption of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b. In 2009, EPA reduced the production and import of virgin HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b and limited the use of those compounds to meet the Montreal Protocol's 2010 milestones.",

The \"2010 HCFC Allocation Rule\" allocated allowances for each year between 2010 and 2014. To meet the stepdown, the number of allowances for HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b were less than for the 2003-2009 control periods. EPA also issued allowances for HCFC-123, HCFC-124, HCFC-225ca, and HCFC-225cb. The rules also limited the use of virgin HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b to existing refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. The \"Pre-Charted Appliances Rule\" banned the sale or distribution of air-conditioning and refrigeration products containing HCFC-22, HCFC-142b, or blends containing one or both of these substances, beginning January 1, 2010. ... The \"2010 HCFC Allocation Rule\" was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Arkema v EPA. In August, 2010, the court decided against EPA. EPA interprets the Court's decision as vacating the portion of the rule that establishes company-by-company production and consumption baselines and calendar-year allowances for HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b. All other aspects of the rule are intact. On August 5, 2011, EPA issued an interim final rule that establishes new company-by-company HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b baselines and allocates production and consumption allowances for 2011.",

The original Montreal Protocol was agreed on 16 September 1987 and entered into force on 1 January 1989. The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(v) and 2.125(e)(4)(iv) is effective December 31, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(iii) is effective June 30, 2011. Removal of 2.125(e)(2)(iv) and Part 2.125(e)(4)(viii) is effective December 31, 2013. /Ozone-Depleting Substances/",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(v) and 2.125(e)(4)(iv) is effective December 31, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(iii) is effective June 30, 2011. Removal of 2.125(e)(2)(iv) and Part 2.125(e)(4)(viii) is effective December 31, 2013. /Ozone-Depleting Substances/",

As impressive as these accomplishments are, our work is not done. Even though we have reduced or eliminated the use of many ozone-depleting substances, some still remain. Additionally, since ozone-depleting substances persist in the air for long periods of time, the past use of these substances continues to affect the ozone layer today. We must also continue to ensure that the alternatives being brought to the market support the country's long-term environmental goals in a cost-effective manner.[EPA; Achievements in Stratospheric Ozone Protection Progress Report, Available from, as of March 11, 2013: http://www.epa.gov/ozone/downloads/spd-annual-report_final.pdf]",

A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin & countershock may be effective.

The respiratory system should be evaluated for injury, aspiration, or pulmonary edema & treated appropriately. CNS findings should be treated supportively. A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin & countershock may be effective. Cryogenic dermal injuries should be treated by water bath rewarming at 40-42 \u00b0C until vasodilatory flush has returned. Elevation of the limb & standard frostbite management with late surgical debridement should be utilized. Ocular exposure requires irrigation & slit lamp evaluation for injury. /Freons/",

The metabolism of HCFC-123a was studied in microsomes of rats, mice, and humans as well as in rats and mice in vivo. Rat, mouse, and human liver microsomes metabolized HCFC-123a to inorganic fluoride and chlorodifluoroacetic acid. Fluoride formation was dependent on time and NADPH, HCFC-123a, and protein concentration. Microsomes from untreated rats oxidized HCFC-123a at low rates (0.49 nmol fluoride/20 min x mg protein). Pretreatment of rats with pyridine and ethanol, inducers of P450 2E1, increased the rates of fluoride release. In mouse liver microsomes, the rates of HCFC-123a oxidation to release fluoride were significantly higher (1.68 nmol fluoride/20 min x mg) than in rat liver microsomes. Incubation of HCFC-123a with microsomes and diethyldithiocarbamate (100 uM), an inhibitor of P450 2E1, reduced fluoride formation by more than 60%. In different samples of human liver microsomes, rates of fluoride formation were between two- and fourfold higher than those observed in liver microsomes from untreated rats. In rats and mice exposed to concentrations of HCFC-123a up to 5000 ppm in a closed recirculating exposure system, chlorodifluoroacetic acid, and inorganic fluoride were identified as urinary metabolites. The biotransformation of HCFC-123a in rats was saturated after exposure to more than 2000 ppm HCFC-123a for 6 hr, whereas no saturation was evident in mice exposed to concentrations of up to 5000 ppm. The obtained results suggest a major role of P450 2E1 in the oxidation of HCFC-123a and in the different capacities for oxidative biotransformation of HCFC-123a in rodents. Mice may thus be more sensitive to toxic effects of HCFC-123a depending on biotransformation after administration of high doses.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 620 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is about 20 years. 1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane is fairly soluble in water and may be removed from the air by rain; however, any removed by this process is expected to rapidly volatilize to the atmosphere. 1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight in the troposphere. Partly halogenated hydrocarbons, such as 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane, are less stable than fully halogenated hydrocarbons. They react with hydroxyl radicals and are thus largely removed by tropospheric OH-reactions. Only a fraction of the amounts emitted into the troposphere reaches the stratosphere and can thereby augment the source of halogen catalysts. The global release rates are such that despite tropospheric removal reactions, they nevertheless contribute to the chlorine budget of the stratosphere. If released to soil,1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 140. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. 1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.6 hours and 4.9 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 13 indicates that its potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane is produced or used.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3), based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.6 hours and 4.9 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 13(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.17(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.

Vapor-phase 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is about 20 years(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.1X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The estimated water solubility of 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane of 232 mg/L at 25 \u00b0C(4), indicates that it may undergo atmospheric removal by wet deposition processes; however, any removed by this process is expected to rapidly revolatilize to the atmosphere(SRC). 1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight in the troposphere(SRC). Partly halogenated hydrocarbons, such as 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane, are less stable than fully halogenated hydrocarbons. They react with hydroxyl radicals and are thus largely removed by tropospheric OH-reactions. Only a fraction of the amounts emitted into the troposphere reaches the stratosphere and can thereby augment the source of halogen catalysts. The global release rates are such that despite tropospheric removal reactions, they nevertheless contribute to the chlorine budget of the stratosphere(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

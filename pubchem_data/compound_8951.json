PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

It may also be found in silver, copper, lead, and nickel minerals. Though selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, trace amounts of the element are necessary for cellular function in most animals, forming the active center of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and three known deiodinase enzymes.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Once in the body, selenium is distributed mainly to the liver and kidney. Selenium is an essential micronutrient and is a component of glutathione peroxidase, iodothyronine 5'-deiodinases, and thioredoxin reductase. Organic selenium is first metabolized into inorganic selenium. Inorganic selenium is reduced stepwise to the intermediate hydrogen selenide, which is either incorporated into selenoproteins after being transformed to selenophosphate and selenocysteinyl tRNA or excreted into the urine after being transformed into methylated metabolites of selenide. Elemental selenium is also methylated before excretion. Selenium is primarily eliminated in the urine and feces, but certain selenium compounds may also be exhaled. (L619)",

Inactivation of the sulfhydryl enzymes necessary for oxidative reactions in cellular respiration, through effects on mitochondrial and microsomal electron transport, might contribute to acute selenium toxicity. Selenomethionine (a common organic selenium compound) also appears to randomly substitute for methionine in protein synthesis. This substitution may affect the structure and functionability of the protein, for example, by altering disulfide bridges. Inorganic forms of selenium appear to react with tissue thiols by redox catalysis, resulting in formation of reactive oxygen species and causing damage by oxidative stress. (L619)",

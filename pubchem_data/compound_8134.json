When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Chemicals were given ad libitum in the drinking water simultaneously with the transplants and continued throughout the study. In all, 20 million leukemic cells were injected sc into syngeneic rats, which after 60 days resulted in a 10-fold increase in relative spleen weights, a 100-fold increase in white blood cell counts, and a 50% reduction in red blood cell indices and platelet counts. Ethylene glycol monomethyl ether given at a dose of 2.5 mg/mL in the drinking water completely eliminated all clinical, morphological, and histopathological evidence of leukemia, whereas the same dose of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether reduced these responses by about 50%. Seven of the glycol ethers were ineffective as anti-leukemic agents, including ethylene glycol, the monopropyl, monobutyl, and monophenyl ethylene glycol ethers, diethylene glycol, and the monomethyl and monoethyl diethylene glycol ethers.",

Epidermal membranes were set up in glass diffusion cells and, following an initial determination of permeability to tritiated water, excess undiluted glycol ether was applied to the outer surface for 8 hr. The appearance of glycol ether in an aqueous receptor phase bathing the underside of the epidermis was quantified by a gas chromatographic technique. A final determination of tritiated water permeability was compared with initial values to establish any irreversible alterations in epidermal barrier function induced by contact with the glycol ethers. 2-methoxyethanol (EM) was most readily absorbed (mean steady rate 2.82 mg/sq cm/hr), and a relatively high absorption rate (1.17 mg/sq cm/hr) was also apparent for 1-methoxypropan-2-ol (PM). There was a trend of reducing absorption rate with increasing molecular weight or reducing volatility for monoethylene glycol ethers (EM, 2.82 mg/sq cm/hr; 2-ethoxyethanol, EE, 0.796 mg/sq cm/hr; 2-butoxyethanol, EB, 0.198 mg/sq cm/hr) and also within the diethylene glycol series: 2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethanol (DM, 0.206 mg/sq cm/hr); 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy) ethanol (DE, 0.125 mg/sq cm/hr) and 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol (DB, 0.035 mg/sq cm/hr). The rate of absorption of 2-ethoxyethyl acetate (EEAc) was similar to that of the parent alcohol, EE. Absorption rates of diethylene glycol ethers were slower than their corresponding monoethylene glycol equivalents. Combination of intrinsic toxicity and ability to pass across skin contribute to assessment of hazards of contact with undiluted glycol ethers.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given 0.051, or 5.1 mmol/kg (14)C labeled bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether orally. The principal urinary metabolites were (2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid and methoxyacetic acid which accounted for around 70 and 6% of the doses, respectively. Smaller amounts of N-(methoxyacetyl)glycine, diglycolic acid, 2-methoxyethanol, and 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol were found. Only unchanged bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether was found in the volatile organic fraction of the expired air. Additionally, rats were given up to 20 daily doses of 5.1 mmol/kg 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol or (2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid at on days 3 through 21. 2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethanol and (2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid induced no gross or histopathological testicular changes. Bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether metabolism proceeds primarily through an O-demethylation pathway, followed by oxidation to (2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid. The lack of toxicity of 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol and (2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid suggests that the testicular toxicity of bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether may be due to methoxyacetic acid, a minor metabolite.",

The principal urinary metabolites were (2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid and methoxyacetic acid which accounted for around 70 and 6% of the doses, respectively. Smaller amounts of N-(methoxyacetyl)glycine, diglycolic acid, 2-methoxyethanol, and 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol were found. Only unchanged bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether was found in the volatile organic fraction of the expired air. ...Bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether metabolism proceeds primarily through an O-demethylation pathway, followed by oxidation to (2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid. The lack of toxicity of 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol and (2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid suggests that the testicular toxicity of bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether may be due to methoxyacetic acid, a minor metabolite.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The cleaners were investigated before exposure (Monday = day 1), after polish removal work (day 2), and after application of floor polish (day 3). Ratings of symptoms, tear-film break-up-time (BUT), nasal patency and biomarkers in nasal lavage were studied. There was a significant increase both day 2 and day 3, as compared to pre-exposure, in ocular, nasal, throat symptoms, solvent smell, dyspnea, and general symptoms such as headache and fatigue. Posterior nasal patency was decreased day 2 (p < 0.01) and day 3 (p < 0.01). No change of nasal biomarkers (eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), myeloperoxidase (MPO), lysozyme, albumin) was seen. BUT was decreased after polish removal (p < 0.01), but not after polish application. Separate test of the weekday effect in non-exposed showed slight improvements, or no change of symptoms or clinical signs from Monday to Wednesday. Air concentrations of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and ethylene glycol phenyl ether 103, 666, 13,650, 7,000, 67, and 27 ug/cu m, respectively, at polish application. Glycol ether levels were reduced to 3% after 2 days and 0.3% after 17 days. Emissions from a common water-based polish remover and floor polish system may cause ocular and airway irritation and general symptoms, and reduce tear-film stability and nasal patency. The levels of glycol ethers had a rapid decay."

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.25 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diethylene glycol monomethyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diethylene glycol monomethyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 hours. Alcohols and ethers do not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Diethylene glycol monomethyl ether is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Aqueous screening test data suggest that biodegradation may be an important removal mechanism of diethylene glycol monomethyl ether in soil and water: theoretical BOD losses of 0, 21 and 66% when incubated at 20 \u00b0C for 5, 10 and 20 days, respectively, were reported. If released into water, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to diethylene glycol monomethyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diethylene glycol monomethyl ether is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and contaminated drinking water, and dermal contact with products containing diethylene glycol monomethyl ether.

Vapor-phase diethylene glycol monomethyl ether is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.6X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Alcohols and ethers do not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this colorless acetone-smelling liquid may occur from its use in organic syntheses. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, tachycardia, nausea, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, fainting, coma and death. Both the OSHA PEL and the ACGIH TLV have been set at a TWA of 200 ppm. In activities or situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and chemical protective clothing. If contact should occur, immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. 3-Pentanone may be easily ignited by heat, sparks, or flame (Flash point: 13 \u00b0C, open cup). Its heavier than air vapor and may travel to a source of ignition and flash back, or result in a build-up of explosive concentrations in enclosed spaces such as sewers. Also, containers may explode in the heat of a fire. 3-Pentanone fires may produce poisonous gases. Therefore, if a tank car or truck is involved in the fire, isolate the area for 1/2 mile in all directions. 3-Pentanone fires may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, standard or alcohol foam, and water spray or fog (solid streams of water may spread the fire). Fight the fire from as far a distance as possible and dike the fire control water. 3-Pentanone should be stored away from sources of ignition and oxidizing materials. 3-Pentanone may be shipped via air, rail, road, and water. Small spills of 3-pentanone may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. Before implementing land disposal of waste 3-pentanone, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

In the majority of cases, the animals of both species significantly discriminated concentrations below 1 ppm from the odorless solvent, and with 2-nonanone and 5-nonanone the monkeys even demonstrated thresholds below 1 ppb. The results showed both primate species have a well-developed olfactory sensitivity for aliphatic ketones, and pigtail macaques generally perform better than squirrel monkeys in detecting members of this class of odorants. Further, in both species tested, ... a significant negative correlation /was found/ between perceptibility in terms of olfactory detection thresholds and carbon-chain length of both the 2-ketones and the symmetrical ketones, but not between detection thresholds and position of the functional group with the C7-ketones. ...",

Diethyl ketone is a naturally occurring volatile emitted from many plants and fruits. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 37.7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diethyl ketone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diethyl ketone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 days. Diethyl ketone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diethyl ketone is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 82. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.0X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Diethyl ketone may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. BODs of 50.8% and 38% of theoretical over a 10 day incubation period using the standard BOD dilution techniques and acclimated sewage inocula suggest that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, diethyl ketone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 19 hours and 8.6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to diethyl ketone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diethyl ketone is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to diethyl ketone via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with products containing diethyl ketone.

Vapor-phase diethyl ketone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.0X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

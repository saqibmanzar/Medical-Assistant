When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Such background concentrations are incorporated in the BEI value. The determinant is nonspecific, since it is also observed after exposure to other chemicals. The biological determinant is an indicator of exposure to the chemical, but the quantitative interpretation of the measurement is ambiguous. These determinants should be used as a screening test if a quantitative test is not practical or as a confirmatory test if the quantitative test is not specific and the origin of the determinant is in question. /Methemoglobin inducers/"

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It may also be released from coal gasification plants and waste incinerators. N-Methylaniline is found naturally in some vegetables and fruits. N-Methylaniline has low adsorptivity to soil and if released on soil may leach. It may photodegrade on the soil surface. N-methylaniline slowly reacts with humic material in soil. It biodegrades in screening studies with acclimated inocula and may be expected to biodegrade in soil. In one study in which high levels of N-methylaniline in sludge was incorporated to soil, N-methylaniline was almost completely degraded from the surface 6 inches of soil in 231 days. N-Methylaniline is estimated to have a relatively high Henry's Law constant and would therefore be expected to volatilize from water. Its volatilization half-life in a model river and model lake is estimated to be 3.5 and 28 days, respectively. It may also photodegrade in surface water or be oxidized by naturally-occurring oxidants in the water body. N-Methylaniline would not be expected to adsorb to sediment or bioconcentrate in fish. N-Methylaniline should exist in the atmosphere as a vapor and react with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of 8.8 hr. It may also photolyze or oxidize while in the vapor phase or in aerosols. N-Methylaniline is soluble in water and therefore should be scavenged by rain. People may be occupationally exposed to N-methylaniline by dermal contact or inhalation. The general population will be exposed by ingesting vegetables in which it naturally occurs. (SRC)",

It may photodegrade on the soil surface(3). Some N-methylaniline may also volatilize from the soil surface. When N-methylaniline was applied to land in sludge and the sludge allowed to dry and then tilled into the soil to a depth 6 inches within 5 days, N-methylaniline degraded fairly rapidly(1). The avg concn of N-methylaniline over 3 plots in 0-6 inch cores was 511, 138, and 16 ppb, 5, 122 and 241 days after sludge application, respectively. While 82 ppb of N-methylaniline was found in 9-15 inch cores, 5 days after application, none was found at later sampling dates. While N-methylaniline biodegrades in screening studies and may therefore be expected to biodegrade in soil, it is also known to slowly react with humic material in soil(4). It is easily oxidized(5) and may react with natural oxidants in soil(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

In a continuous biological treatment simulation test, complete DOC removal was achieved(3). N-Methylaniline (100 ppm) was moderately biodegradable in an activated sludge test with 42% total organic carbon removed(2). The test solution and acclimation procedure employed attempted to simulate industrial wastewater treated at the Fukashiba treatment plant in Japan. Aberrant behavior of N-methylaniline in a semi-continuous activated sludge (SCAS) biodegradation test was found to result from inadequate acclimation of the inoculum(4).

Results of standard aerobic biodegradability tests for N-methylaniline include: 92% Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in 8 days in the Zahn-Wellens test; 29 and 67% DOC removal after 28 and 42 days, respectively in the French AFNOR test(2); 46% CO2 produced and 92% DOC removed in 28 days after 14 days acclimation (Sturm test)(1); 17% DOC removal after 19 days in the OECD Screening test(1); 38% Theoretical BOD was obtained in a 5-day test(5); 18-20% Theoretical BOD was expended after 5-8 days in a respiratory test using 500 ppm of the test substance(3); 0% Theoretical BOD in 30 days with a drop of sewage as an inoculum(1); 3% BODT in 14 days in the MITI test(1); 8% mineralization to CO2 occurred in a 21-day test using an activated sludge inoculum(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The Koc for N-methylaniline predicted from molecular structure is 65(3). According to a suggested classification scheme(5), this estimated Koc suggests that N- methylaniline will be highly mobile in soil(SRC). Batch equilibrium studies used to determine the adsorption isotherms for N-methylaniline to a Podzol (4.85% OC pH 2.8), an Alfisol (1.25% OC, pH 6.7) and a sediment (1.58% OC, pH 7.1) yielded the results (soil, Freundlich adsorption constants (Kf), Freundlich exponent (1/n), Koc): Podzol, 22.29, 0.89, 460; Alfisol, 0.59, 0.78, 47; Sediment, 1.12, 0.77, 71(1). N-Methylaniline will be almost completely ionized at the pH of the Podzol and therefore ionic interactions may be dominant(1,SRC). N-Methylaniline reacts slowly with humates possibly by adding to quinoidal structures in the humic substances(4). Covalent bond formation is inferred by the lack of extractability of the aniline from the humic material as well as reactions with model compounds(4).",

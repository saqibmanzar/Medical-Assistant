Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Trichlorobenzoic acid is found on List D. Case No: 4088; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered. Therefore, we are characterizing the case as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI):Trichlorobenzoic acid; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered products. Thus, we characterize it as \"cancelled.\".",

Trichlorobenzoic acid was fed in dietary levels of 0, 10, 30, or 100 ppm for 90 days Sprague-Dawley albino rats and beagle dogs. Acute 50% lethal dose in male and female rats was determined to be 3075 mg/kg. In subchronic studies, a marked reduction in weight gain was apparent throughout the study in male and female rats given 3000 ppm 2,4,6-trichlorobenzyl chloride and male rats given 1500 ppm 2,4,6-trichlorobenzyl chloride for 3 weeks. The only microscopic changes noted were hepatic degenerative alterations, prominent in all male and female rats receiving 3000 ppm 2,4,6-trichlorobenzyl chloride. No blood or urine chemistry changes were seen. Rats and dogs receiving 100 ppm 2,4,6-trichlorobenzoic acid for 90 days showed no treatment related effects on survival, growth, food consumption, or behavior. No significant differences were noted in blood or urine parameters in these animals, and no histologic changes were seen. /It was/ concluded that 2,4,6-trichlorobenzyl chloride has lower acute oral toxicity than benzyl halides. 2,4,6-Trichlorobenzyl chloride also appears to be less acutely toxic than its acid derivative, trichlorobenzoic acid. Repeated exposures to 2,4,6-trichlorobenzyl chloride resulted in chemically induced liver injury with marked degenerative/regenerative processes and no excessive accumulation of lipids. /It was suggested/ that 2,4,6-trichlorobenzyl chloride may be metabolized differently from other benzyl halides, perhaps because of its aromatic constituents or differences in solubility which affect uptake or retention.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.5X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 112 days. Particulate-phase 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Photodegradation of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid observed in water solutions irradiated at wavelengths >290 nm in laboratory tests suggests that the 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid may be susceptible to direct photolysis in the ambient atmosphere. If released to soil, 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 65. 2,3,6-Trichlorobenzoic acid was shown to leach readily through soil in field and laboratory tests. The estimated pKa of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid is 1.8, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because anions do not volatilize. 2,3,6-Trichlorobenzoic acid is resistant to biodegradation as shown by the Japanese MITI test where 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid present reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum. If released into water, 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. In an anaerobic freshwater lake sediment grab sample study, 100% of the 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid added to the sediment was transformed in 84-364 days to 2,6-dichlorobenzoate without evidence of mineralization. The estimated pKa indicates 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. BCF values of <3.5 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that limited general population exposure to 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid may have occurred via ingestion of contaminated food and dermal contact with contaminated water following flood events in areas where this herbicide was used.

Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because anions do not volatilize. 2,3,6-Trichlorobenzoic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 5.5X10-4 mm Hg(5). Screening studies have shown 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid to be resistant to biodegradation; 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(8).",

Vapor-phase 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 112 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.43X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Particulate-phase 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). The photodegradation of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid observed in water solutions irradiated at wavelengths >290 nm in laboratory tests(4) suggests that the 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid may be susceptible to direct photolysis in the ambient atmosphere(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The estimated pKa of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid is 1.8(3), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). 2,3,6-Trichlorobenzoic acid readily leaches through soil; 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid has been found at depths of 11 feet following surface application(5). Approximately 10% of the 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid applied at rates of 0.2 and 0.6 kg/hectare to 8 experimental plots leached an unspecified distance to the tile-drain groundwater in 3 months(6). 2,3,6-Trichlorobenzoic acid was found to be readily leached from soil columns containing 4 different types of soil (Staten Island peaty muck, Stockton adobe clay, Yolo fine sandy loam and Hesperia sandy loam)(7). In a soil column filled with silty clay loam, 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid was leached 20 inches upon the addition of sufficient water to wet the column to 22 inches(8). Most of the residual herbicidal activity of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid applied to a test field at a rate of 15-30 lb/acre was present in the second, third and fourth foot depth of the 6 foot of depth tested(9).",

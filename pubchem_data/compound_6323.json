It was used extensively as a pesticide and as a fire extinguisher component until being phased out by most countries in the early 2000s, as it is considered an ozone-depleting substance. The primary use of methyl bromide is/was as a fumigant in soil to control fungi, nematodes, and weeds; in space fumigation of food commodities (e.g., grains); and in storage facilities (such as mills, warehouses, vaults, ships, and freight cars) to control insects and rodents. Its popularity as a fumigant is largely attributable to its high toxicity to many pests, the variety of settings in which it can be applied, its ability to penetrate the fumigated substances, and its rapid dissipation following application. Trace amounts of methyl bromide have been detected in drinking water.  There are many reports of humans who have died following acute inhalation exposure to bromomethane. Most cases have involved accidental exposures associated with manufacturing or packaging operations, use of fire extinguishers containing bromomethane, or fumigation activities. Death is not immediate, but usually occurs within l-2 days of exposure. The cause of death is not certain, but is probably due to neurological and lung injury.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The hydrogen bromide used can be generated in situ from bromine and a reducing agent. A new continuous process for the production of bromomethane from methanol and aqueous HBr in the presence of a silica supported heteropolyacid catalyst has recently been described. Bromomethane can also be coproduced with other organic bromine compounds by the reaction of the solvent methanol with hydrogen bromide that is formed as byproduct. The processes include coproduction of bromomethane with bromostyrenes, tribromophenol, and especially tetrabromobisphenol A.",

Methyl bromide vapor (99% purity) is continuously withdrawn from the reactor overhead system and scrubbed free of dimethyl ether by contacting the gas with a sulfuric acid scrubber. ... By operating at a higher temperature and pressure than described in other similar processes, this process allows for good control of the exothermic reaction, retards the formation of dimethyl ether, and produces methyl bromide in high yield and purity.",

Thus, when a solution of phenol in methanol is reacted with bromine, aromatic substitution produces a 96% yield of the flame retardant intermediate, 2,4,6-tribromophenol, and hydroxyl substitution of the solvent produces methyl bromide in 34% yield. The flame retardant tetrabromo-bisphenol-A and methyl bromide are obtained in 95% and 61% yields, respectively, by the similar bromination of bisphenol- A in methanol. Even though methyl bromide yields are much less than theory because of the equilibrium ... favorable economics are achieved because less methanol and HBr need to be recovered, and a saleable coproduct is produced.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this colorless, nearly odorless gas may occur from its use as a fumigant for soil, grain and other commodities, as a solvent, methylating agent, and extracting agent. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, dizziness, headache, nausea, respiratory irritation, ventricular fibrillation, pulmonary edema (sometimes delayed 4 to 5 days), convulsions, coma, and death. The OSHA PEL is set at a ceiling limit of 20 ppm, with a notation that skin contact is to be prevented. The ACGIH has recommended a TWA of 5 ppm. Levels should be controlled by local exhaust ventilation, with a continuous monitoring system to warn of excursions. In activities or situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus with a full facepiece, and full chemical protective clothing (including gloves and boots) which is specifically recommended by the shipper or producer to prevent skin contact with methyl bromide. If contact should result, immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. While methyl bromide does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of irritating and poisonous gases. Also, containers may explode violently in the heat of a fire. Fires involving methyl bromide may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, or standard foam. Water spray, if used, should be applied with caution because it may cause frothing. Dike runoff from fire-control water. Methyl bromide should be stored in dry, well-ventilated areas, away from sources of ignition, direct sunlight, and sources of physical damage. Choice of containers should take into account methyl bromide's reactivity with aluminum, magnesium, tin, zinc, and other alloys. Certain methods of shipment are forbidden for methyl bromide. Consult with the regulatory requirements of the US Department of Transportation for detailed shipping and labelling instructions. If methyl bromide should spill or leak from a small container or pressurized cylinder, first remove ignition sources, then ventilate the spill area and stop the leak. Isolate the area 75 feet in all directions from the spill. For a large spill, water spray or mist may be necessary to knock down vapor. Dike any surface flow with soil or sandbags to keep the material out of water sources or sewers. Absorb bulk liquid with fly ash or cement powder. Before implementing land disposal of waste methyl bromide, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Methyl bromide is a pesticide that has been banned in the United States for use in homes and other residential settings. An investigation conducted by the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Health (VIDOH), the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR), and EPA confirmed that methyl bromide had been used as a fumigant on March 18 in the building where the family had been residing, 2 days before they were transported to the hospital; three family members had life-threatening illness. On March 25, 2015, a stop-use order for methyl bromide was issued by DPNR to the pest control company that had performed the fumigation. Subsequent investigation revealed that previous fumigation with methyl bromide had occurred on October 20, 2014, at the same condominium resort. In addition to the four ill family members, 37 persons who might have been exposed to methyl bromide as a result of the October 2014 or March 2015 fumigations were identified by VIDOH and ATSDR. Standardized health questionnaires were administered to 16 of the 20 persons for whom contact information was available; six of 16 had symptoms consistent with methyl bromide exposure, including headache and fatigue. Pest control companies should be aware that use of methyl bromide is banned in homes and other residential settings, and clinicians should be aware of the toxicologic syndrome that exposure to methyl bromide can cause.",

Measurements of CH3Br, carried out at the site within hours after the accident, suggest that exposure on the second day may have been in excess of 200 ppm (800 mg/cu m) CH3Br. All workers were admitted for observation. Seven of them were discharged after an uneventful overnight observation and residual symptoms, if any, subsided within three weeks of the accident. Two patients needed intensive care for several weeks because of severe reactive myoclonus and tonic-clonic generalised convulsions. These conditions were unresponsive to repeated doses of diazepam, clonazepam, and diphenylhydantoin but could be suppressed effectively by induction of a thiopental coma that had to be continued for three weeks. In some of the patients prior subchronic exposure to CH3Br, as shown by their occupational histories and high serum bromide (Br-) concentrations, is likely to have been a factor contributing to the severity of their symptoms. A direct association between serum Br- concentrations and the severity of neurological symptoms, however, seemed to be absent. An on site investigation into the circumstances leading to the accident showed the presence of an empty and out of use drainage system that covered both sections of the greenhouse. This was probably the most important factor contributing to the rapid and inadvertent spread of CH3Br.",

It is also used as a post harvest treatment of commodities and structural fumigation. Structural non-food treatments (such as residential buildings) are reportedly no longer performed. It is also used in synthesis of many pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals, either as a methylating agent or as the Grignard reagent, methylmagnesium bromide. HUMAN STUDIES: Methyl bromide can cause severe irritation and corrosive skin injury, blisters and vesicles resembling second-degree burns.  In particular, severe injury may occur if gas or liquid is trapped in gloves, boots or other clothing. A number of fatalities have occurred in humans from inhalation of methyl bromide. Overwhelming exposure may cause death from CNS depression and respiratory failure. In addition, inhalation exposure to high levels of methyl bromide may cause direct damage to lungs resulting in chemical pneumonia and edema that also may be fatal. Secondarily, inhalation exposure may damage the central and peripheral nervous system. In cases where damage to the lung is not fatal, death may result from convulsions or coma. Where death has not resulted, CNS and PNS damage may persist, the former as organic brain syndrome and the latter as a peripheral neuropathy in cases of heavy exposure. CNS and PNS damage results more commonly from episodic or high level chronic rather than acute exposure. More rarely, renal and hepatic sequelae may ensue from acute overexposure to methyl bromide. Human experience indicates that acute fatal intoxication can result from exposures to vapor levels as low as 1164 to 1552 mg/cu m, and harmful effects can occur at 388 mg/cu m or more. Systemic poisoning has been reported to occur from a two week exposure (8 hr/day) at about 136 mg/cu m. Symptoms generally increase in severity with increasing levels of exposure and may vary somewhat according to exposure circumstances and individual susceptibility. In sublethal poisoning cases a latency period of 2 to 48 hr (usually about 4 to 6 hr) occurs between exposure and onset of symptoms. Exposure of human lymphocyte cultures to 4.3% methyl bromide for 100 sec increased the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges from 10.0 to 16.8%. Compared to individuals with no history of methyl bromide exposure, samples from exposed workers showed an increased incidence of micronuclei in oropharyngeal cells, and an increased frequency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase gene (hprt) mutations in lymphocyte. ANIMAL STUDIES: Experimental exposure of a rabbit's eye to pure methyl bromide gas at room temperature for one and one half minutes caused immediate loss of surface luster, followed in several hours by loss of corneal epithelium, and much edema of the conjunctivae and lids. A day later the corneal stroma was bluish, much swollen, and nearly opaque, but within five days the cornea started to clear. Toxic responses in rabbits administered bromomethane sc at 20-120 mg/kg included limb paralysis, cessation of drinking, reduced urine excretion. Levels >50 mg/kg sharply increased the blood bromide level and reduced platelets, serotonin, and water content. Mice were exposed to 0, 0.87, 1.72, 2.20, 2.70, 3.50, 3.82, 4.70, 5.77, or 5.93 mg/L. Animals exposed to 3.50 mg/L or more exhibited kidney lesions. Animals with exposure to 2.20 or 2.70 mg/L showed decreased lung and liver weight. Liver lesions appeared in animals exposed to 4.70 mg/L. Animals exposed to 5.77 mg/L developed decreased motor coordination. Oral administration of 25 and 50 mg/kg bw methyl bromide by gavage for periods of 20, 60, 90 and 120 days, caused ulceration and epithelial hyperplasia of the forestomach in rats without evidence of malignancy. In other experiment, the incidence of adenomas of the pituitary gland was significantly increased in high-dose males compared with controls. In females, no increase in the incidence of tumors related to treatment was observed. No clinical evidence of maternal toxicity, fetoxicity or developmental toxicity was observed in rats. Inseminated rabbits exposed to 70 ppm methyl bromide were terminated due to excessive mortality and neurotoxicity characterized by convulsions and paresis in the hind limbs seen after one week of treatment. Control and 20 ppm exposed rabbits were sacrificed on gestation day 30. No fetoxicity nor developmental toxicity was noted in the 20 ppm group. Alkylation of guanine-N-7 in DNA of liver and spleen was observed after treatment of male mice with (14)C methyl bromide by inhalation. Methyl bromide was mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA100 when tested at concn of 0.02-0.2% in desiccators in absence of metabolic activation. A commercial methyl bromide was mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 and TA100 (but not to TA1538 or TA98) and to Escherchia coli WP2 hcr in the absence of metabolic activation. Micronuclei were induced in bone marrow cells of rats and mice and in peripheral blood cells of mice exposed to methyl bromide by inhalation for 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk for 2 wk. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Morphological damage to the gill epithelium, indicative of alkylation of cell membranes, was the most pronounced effect of methyl bromide in carp. Not hazardous to bees when used as described.",

Consequently they can readily modify free thiols (cysteines) and methionine residues of the surfaces of proteins leading to the disruption of enzyme, transporter or membrane functions. The bromide ion (which is produced from bromomethane metabolism in the body) is known to affect the central nervous system, causing a condition called bromism. This is believed to be a result of bromide ions substituting for chloride ions in the in actions of neurotransmitters and transport systems, thus affecting numerous synaptic processes. (L626, L627, T104). However, the exact mechanism of toxicity for methyl bromide is currently uncertain, although its alkylating property as well as the reactive intermediates formed through metabolic transformation remain attractive hypotheses.",

Degenerative and proliferative lesions in the nasal cavity developed in rats chronically exposed to bromomethane by inhalation.  Chronic inhalation exposure of male animals has resulted in effects on the testes at high concentrations. Studies in humans indicate that the lung may be most severely injured by the acute inhalation exposure of bromomethane.  The kidney is also sensitive to bromomethane.

Symptoms of acute exposure in humans include headaches, dizziness, fainting, apathy, weakness, confusion, speech impairment, visual effects, numbness, twitching, and tremors; in severe cases paralysis and convulsions are possible. Bromomethane is irritating to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract.  Dermal exposure to bromomethane can cause itching, redness, and blisters in humans. Neurological effects, including lethargy, forelimb twitching, tremors, and paralysis, have also been observed after chronic exposure to bromomethane. ",

Visual disturbances such as blurred or double vision may also appear.  A characteristic delay of more than 1 hour up to 48 hours in the onset of symptoms has been described in several human exposures. Severe poisoning may cause tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness,and permanent brain damage. A great variety of central nervous system manifestations have been described: numbness, ataxia, tremor, myoclonus, positive Romberg's sign, great agitation, change of personality. Whereas convulsions generally occur in fatal cases, death usually is the result of pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure or cardiovascular collapse."

Secondarily, inhalation exposure may damage the central and peripheral nervous system. In cases where damage to the lung is not fatal, death may result from convulsions or coma (ibid.). Where death has not resulted, CNS and PNS damage may persist, the former as organic brain syndrome and the latter as a peripheral neuropathy in cases of heavy exposure. CNS and PNS damage results more commonly from episodic or high level chronic rather than acute exposure ... .

Additional groups of 16 mice were included for neurobehavioral evaluations throughout the 2-year studies. By 20 weeks (139 days), 27 males and 7 females exposed to 100 ppm had died and methyl bromide exposure was discontinued for the remaining mice in this dose group. Ten female mice from the 100 ppm group predesignated for the 15-month interim evaluation were killed on schedule and all other high-dose animals were allowed to live to term (24 months) for evaluation of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity. Clinical signs indicative of neurotoxicity, including tremors, abnormal posture, tachypnea, and hind leg paralysis, persisted in these high-dose mice until the end of the studies. Final mean body weights of surviving 100 ppm males and females were markedly lower (33% and 31%) than those of the controls. Neurobehavioral changes occurred in male and female mice initially exposed to 100 ppm methyl bromide, with more pronounced changes observed in males. In general, these animals were less active and manifested a heightened sensitivity in the startle response than mice in other dose groups. Exposure to methyl bromide was not carcinogenic under the conditions of these studies. However, there was an increase in the incidence of several nonneoplastic lesions in the brain, heart, bone (sternum), and nose. Degenerative changes in the cerebellum and cerebrum occurred in males and females exposed to 100 ppm. Myocardial degeneration and cardiomyopathy were observed in the hearts of mice exposed to 100 ppm. An increased incidence of sternal dysplasia was seen in treated animals, particularly in those exposed to 100 ppm. An increased incidence of olfactory epithelial necrosis and metaplasia within the nasal cavity was seen in the mice exposed to 100 ppm, particularly males. ... Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, methyl bromide caused degenerative changes in the cerebellum and cerebrum, myocardial degeneration and cardiomyopathy, sternal dysplasia, and olfactory epithelial necrosis and metaplasia. Toxic effects persisted although exposure to methyl bromide in the 100 ppm group terminated after 20 weeks. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of methyl bromide in male or female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 10, 33, or 100 ppm.",

Two additional 90-day treatment groups (10 rats/dose level), respectively, were allowed 60- and 30-day recovery before necropsy. Supplemental groups (10 rats/dose level) of control and high dosed (50 mg/kg/day) rats also received treatment for approximately 30, 60, and 90 days, the 90-day groups undergoing gastrotomy prior to terminal necropsy. Relative to both control and low dose rats, 50 mg/kg/day oral dosing for 30 days was associated with lethargy, decreased feeding efficiency with weight loss, increased water consumption, soft stool, and some abdominal distention. Gross lesions predominated in the peritoneum and nonglandular stomach and included both nonspecific diffuse and focal changes of the gastric mucosa, atrophy of the surface squamous epithelium, and multiple adhesions of the gastric serosa to adjacent organs. Hyperplasia consisted of acanthosis and hyperkeratosis, with epithelial projections (\"pegs\") in all rats of this group; fibrotic lesions of the tunica muscularis and fibrotic serosa adhesions contained duct-like structures as well. These changes were statistically significant in association with treatment (irrespective of dose) relative to control and length of exposure, but did not demonstrate a dose-related significance (incidence differences between treated groups was not significant by Duncan's multiple range test). Increased fibrosis of the lamina propria and lymphocytic infiltrates of the glandular stomach were statistically significant (p </= 0.05, Duncan's multiple range test) overall in the high-dose group, but were considered secondary to necrosis. Regression of lesions of the squamous epithelial portion of the stomach upon treatment cessation confirmed a reparable hyperplastic response to oral methyl bromide. Further, cessation of treatment was associated with recovery of generalized bodyweight and growth loses in treated rats relative to controls. No treatment-related malignancy was noted.",

Exposure to 750 mg/cu m was associated with marked growth retardation, tremors, and motor incoordination. All treated rats had dose-related reduction in absolute and increase in relative brain weight compared with controls. Histologic examination showed pulmonary hyperemia with focal hemorrhage in 3/6 rats of 750 mg/cu m exposures. In range-finding tests, rats (6/sex/exposure level) were exposed to concentrations of 0, 70, 200, or 600 mg/cu m methyl bromide, 5 days/week for 3 weeks and 7 days of a fourth week. Exposures to 600 mg/m3 was associated with anorexia, stunted growth, and death (3/6 females, 5/6 males). This group also exhibited uprighting and balancing anomalies, while 3/6, 6/6, and 6/6 of low-, mid-, and high-concentration groups had abnormal gait. Elevated serum SGPT and alkaline phosphatase activity characterized the clinical chemistry and there was evidence of disrupted blood morphology. Histologic examination revealed lesions of the heart including diffuse fatty vacuolization and degeneration of myocardial fiber, and hyperemic lungs with marked alveolar dilation in 600 mg/cu m rats. Some animals exhibited interstitial pneumonia. This study reports a NOAEL of 70 mg/cu m.",

Ten of each sex/group were sacrificed for interim pathology assessments at 13, 52 and 104 weeks, and 10 rats/sex/group removed from study at Week 41 received behavioral evaluation. High dose animals showed slightly increased mortality, slightly diminished bodyweights, and reduced brain weights in both males and females. The reduction in brain weight was statistically significant in females, but not in males. No other distinct clinical observations and no changes in hematology, biochemistry, or urine were noted throughout the study. Increased incidence of hemothorax was observed in dead and moribund 90 ppm rats. On microscopic evaluation, increased incidence of slight hyperplasia and degenerative lesions of the dorsomedial nasal epithelium was significantly (Fischer exact probability test) dose related. These changes did not appear to progress with time. Increased hyperkeratosis was observed in the esophagus of 30 ppm males and and both esophagus and forestomach of 90 ppm males and females, but the increase reached statistical significance in the esophagus of 90 ppm males. The incidence of cardiac thrombosis was also significantly increased in 90 ppm males and females, respectively, at 105 weeks and 29 months. The significantly increased myocardial degeneration with cartilaginous metaplasia (3 ppm females, 90 ppm males) also increased in severity with length of exposure, that change significant in 90 ppm females but not in the males.

Ten of each sex/treatment group were sacrificed for interim assessments at 13, 52 and 104 weeks. This report by Dr. Jerry F. Hardisty of Experimental Pathology Laboratories, Inc. primarily constitutes confirmation of the original study pathologist's conclusions. Upon specific reexamination of nasal cavity specimens in groups sacrificed at 52 and 104 weeks, incidence of basal cell hyperplasia of olfactory epithelium in the dorsi-medial nasal cavity in low dose groups did not reach statistical significance (Fischer's exact probability test) relative to controls. Such changes in mid- and high-dose rats were significantly related to exposure level; however, a low level exposure established the inhalation NOEL of 3 ppm for this study, contrary to original study conclusions.

The 4 hr median lethal concentration was calculated at approximately 17 mg/L ie, the order of magnitude of actually encountered peak concentration in surface water. The concentration effect curve was very steep and the response was somewhat delayed. Morphological damage to the gill epithelium, indicative of alkylation of cell membranes, was the most pronounced effect of methyl bromide. It consisted of initial swelling of the lymphatic space and vacuolization of the epithelial cells, followed by disintegration of the epithelium and invasion of leukocytes.",

                                                    "String": "Methyl bromide's production may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams; its use as an insecticide, acaricide, nematicide, rodenticide and soil sterilant will result in its direct release to the environment. Under the Montreal Protocol, use of methyl bromide in industrialized countries was to be completely eliminated in 2005. In non-industrial countries, use was to be completely eliminated in 2015. The bulk of the methyl bromide detected in the environment is believed to be released from oceans; the gross flux of methyl bromide to the atmosphere from the oceans is 3.9X10+10 g/yr. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1620 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl bromide will exist in the gas phase. Gas-phase methyl bromide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is about 1.5 years. Methyl bromide absorbs UV light at wavelength 200 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm. Upward diffusion of methyl bromide to the stratosphere occurs into which lower wavelength light can penetrate and where photolysis is expected to be the predominant removal mechanism for methyl bromide. If released to soil, methyl bromide is expected to have very high mobility based upon Koc values of 9 to 22. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.34X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl bromide may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Chemical reactions, likely nucleophilic substitutions on soil organic matter, are the predominant pathway through which methyl bromide degrades in soil. If released into water, methyl bromide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its Koc values. Utilizing a sludge test, 17% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.0 hours and 3.9 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process based on a half-life of 20 days under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to methyl bromide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl bromide is produced or used. US farm workers may have been exposed to methyl bromide during its past use as a soil sterilant. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methyl bromide via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Mean aquatic production of methyl bromide was estimated at 1.5X10+10 g/yr(3). Of the methyl bromide produced in the ocean, 60-75% of it is destroyed in situ, with the remainder being emitted to the atmosphere(3). The gross flux of methyl bromide to the atmosphere from the oceans is 3.9X10+10 g/yr(3). Global biomass burning could contribute an average of 3X10+10 g (range, 1X10+10 to 5X10+10 g) of methyl bromide annually to the atmosphere(3). The study of two southern California coastal salt marshes showed up to 42 umol/sq m/day flux rates of methyl bromide, with large diurnal, seasonal and spatial variablities(4). The methyl bromide emission rate from saltwort was 12 ng/g dry weight/day at 25 \u00b0C and increased to 175 ng/g dry weight/day at 50 \u00b0C(5). The release of methyl bromide by polar macroalgae (brown, red and green) was investigated at 0 \u00b0C under a laboratory setting; Phaeophyta (brown algae) produced methyl bromide up to 60 ng/g wet algal weight per day while red and green algae produced negligible amounts(6).",

In 1992, emissions of industrially produced methyl bromide from soil fumigation, durable disinfestation, perishable disinfestation, and structural disinfestation ranged from 16.7-47.3 Gg (where Gg = 10+9 g), 4.8-8.4 Gg, 5.4-6.0 Gg, and 2.0-2.1 Gg, respectively(2). Methyl bromide may be released in auto exhaust when ethylene dibromide is used in leaded gasoline by catalytic decomposition of ethylene dibromide(3), although the amount of leaded gasoline being used is considerably reduced(SRC). Methyl bromide may also be released in exhaust fumes from turbines(4). Emission rate of methyl bromide from ash was 0.23 ng/g dry weight/day at 30 \u00b0C and 4.6 ng/g dry weight at 50 \u00b0C(5).",

Volatilization of methyl bromide from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 7.34X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(3). Methyl bromide is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1620 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4). In soil, chemical reactions, likely nucleophilic substitutions on soil organic matter, were identified as the predominate pathway through which methyl bromide was degraded(5). Methyl bromide reacts rapidly with aniline, a model used to simulate reactions with organic matter in soil; the degradation half-life of methyl bromide with aniline was 2.9 days at 24 \u00b0C(5). The oxidation of 14C-methyl bromide to 14CO2 was measured in field experiments with soils fumigated with mixtures of methyl bromide and chloropicrin. Degradation of methyl bromide by chemical and/or biological processes accounted for 20 to 50% of the loss of methyl bromide during fumigation(6) with the remainder of methyl bromide loss due to volatilization(SRC).",

Bromide ion concentration increased in the leachate from a background level of 0.01 ug/g to 0.4 ug/g within the first rain event, peaked at a concentration of 4.3 ug/g in 3 weeks and then decreased with subsequent rain events. This study showed that methyl bromide will degrade in the soil before it will leach through the soil profile(1).",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.0 hours and 3.9 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.19(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process based on a rate constant of 4.1X10-7/sec(8), corresponding to a half-life of 20 days under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9).

Gas-phase methyl bromide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.5 years(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.9X10-14 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3) Methyl bromide absorbs UV light at wavelength 200 nm(4,5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm(SRC). Upward diffusion of methyl bromide to the stratosphere is believed to be the dominant loss mechanism of this compound from the troposphere(5). In the stratosphere, into which lower wavelength light can penetrate, photolysis is expected to be the predominant removal mechanism for methyl bromide(6).",

The oxidation of 14C-methyl bromide to 14CO2 was measured in field experiments with soils collected from two strawberry plots fumigated with mixtures of methyl bromide and chloropicrin. Degradation of methyl bromide by chemical and/or biological processes accounted for 20 to 50% of the loss of methyl bromide during fumigation. Oxidation was by direct bacterial attack of methyl bromide and not of methanol (a product of chemical hydrolysis). Repeated addition of methyl bromide to live soils resulted in higher rates of removal, suggesting that soil bacteria used methyl bromide as an electron donor for growth(2).",

Methyl bromide was oxidized to formaldehyde by a soluble methane monooxygenase isolated from Methylbacterium sp. CRL-26(3). Cell-free extracts and whole cell suspensions of Methylococcus capsulatus oxidized methyl bromide to formaldehyde(2,4), but Methylococcus capsulatus was unable to grow on methyl bromide(2). Methyl bromide was rapidly catalyzed to methyl chloride under anaerobic and microaerophilic seawater conditions when incubated with soil bacterium srain CC495. Under aerobic conditions 97% of the methyl bromide was oxidized in 40 minutes(5). A marine Sphingomonadaceae bacteria was shown to degrade methyl bromide in the presence of toluene despite the latter as having been shown to inhibit biodegradation of methyl bromide in coastal and open seawater samples(6).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.5 years at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(SRC). The rates of removal of methyl bromide from the atmosphere by Cl and NO3 radicals, and by cloud and rain water are negligible(2). The hydrolysis rate constant of methyl bromide at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7 ranges from 3X10-7(3) to 4.1X10-7/sec(4) which translates into half-lives of about 20 to 26.7 days(SRC). The products of methyl bromide hydrolysis are methanol and bromide ion(5). Methyl bromide had a hydrolysis half-life of 20.1 days at 25 \u00b0C(6). The total degradation rate for methyl bromide in seawater ranges from 8 to 42%/day for a temperature range of 20 to 30 \u00b0C; the reaction with Cl-ions is around 6.5 times that of the reaction with water(2). For example, at a sea water surface temperature of 21.9 \u00b0C and a chloride concentration of 0.56 mol/L, the calculated degradation half-life of methyl bromide in sea water is 4 days; at 35 \u00b0C, the half-life is 22 hrs(7). Methyl bromide absorbs UV light at wavelength 200 nm(8,9) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm(SRC). The half-life for direct photolysis of methyl bromide is 150,000 days(10). However, with the upward diffusion of methyl bromide from the troposphere to stratosphere into which lower wavelength light can penetrate, photolysis is expected to be the primary removal mechanism(11).",

When exposed to a variety of soil types at low mixing ratios, methyl bromide is irreversibly and quickly removed to below the levels found in the global atmosphere. The annual global soil uptake estimates for methyl bromide are 6.5X10+9 g/yr, 2.17X10+10 g/yr, 9.7X10+9 g/yr, 1.7X10+9 g/yr, 2.7X10+9 g/yr, and 4.2X10+10 g/yr for tropical forest and savanna soils, temperate forest and woodland shrubland soils, temperate grassland soils, boreal forest soils, and cultivated land, respectively(1). The annual total global soil sink for methyl bromide is 4.2X10+10 g/yr(1). In soil, chemical reactions, likely nucleophilic substitutions on soil organic matter, were identified as the primary pathway through which methyl bromide was degraded(2). Methyl bromide reacts rapidly with aniline (a model used to simulate reactions with organic matter in soil) compared to direct hydrolysis with water; the degradation half-life of methyl bromide with aniline is 2.9 days at 24 \u00b0C(2). Experiments using 14C-labeled methyl bromide resulted in abiotic degradation half-lives of 22 days in water, and 42 and 4 days in sandy loam and clay loam soils, respectively(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that methyl bromide is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 3.0 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 3.9 days(SRC). A volatilization half-life of 72 min for methyl bromide was obtained by an experiment in which 100 ppm of methyl bromide was placed in a 39.4 cm aeration cylinder and air bubbled through for 4 hr(3). The mass transfer coefficient of methyl bromide is 22.56 cm/hour at 25 \u00b0C(3), and this value was used to calculate a volatilization half-life of 3.1 hr for methyl bromide from 1 m of water(2). Methyl bromide's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The volatility of methyl bromide from treated soils (initial concentration 2,733 ug/g soil; soil moisture = -33 kPa) incubated at 15 \u00b0C, 25 \u00b0C, and 35 \u00b0C were 32%, 35%, and 54%, respectively(4); more than 86% of the total methyl bromide flux occurred within 3 hrs at all three temperatures(4). The volatility increased with increasing soil moisture(4). A measured 4%, 35%, and 65% of the applied methyl bromide volatilized from soil samples with -300 kPa, -33 kPa, and -3 kPa soil moisture content, respectively(4). Volatilization of methyl bromide from dry soil surfaces may occur(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1620 mm Hg(5). Using a soil screening model, the half-lives for the volatilization of methyl bromide from 1 and 10 cm were estimated to be 0.2 and 0.5 days, respectively(6).",

In rivers, only a very slight increase of bromide ion was noted during periods of intensive leaching, and the concentration did not exceed 1 mg/L except at one site where levels ranging from 1.1 to 4.4 mg/L were thought to be due to the presence of seawater(1).

Occupational exposure to methyl bromide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl bromide is produced or used(SRC). US farm workers may have been exposed to methyl bromide during its use as a soil disinfectant(SRC). During soil disinfection in greenhouses, methyl bromide concentration varied between 30 and 3,000 ppm(2). Exposure levels of applicators were greatly dependent on the fumigation techniques(2). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methyl bromide via inhalation of ambient air(SRC). Higher exposure may have occured near agricultural areas where it was used as a soil fumigant(SRC).",

Whether after 10 to 60 min incubation of pieces of pancreas in the presence of [2-(14)C]alloxan or 60 min to 24 h after intravenous injection of [2-(14)C]alloxan to control and insulin-treated STZ rats, the radioactive content of the pancreas (dpm/mg wet weight) only represented, in the STZ rats, about two thirds of the reference value found in control animals. These findings indicate that insulin-producing islet B-cells participate to a sizeable extent to the overall uptake of [2-(14)C]- alloxan by the whole pancreatic gland, despite the fact that they account for no more than about one percent of the total pancreas mass. Hence, it should be possible to preferentially label the endocrine moiety of the pancreas, in the perspective of its imaging and quantification by a non-invasive procedure, by use of a suitable radiolabelled molecule selectively taken up by islet, as distinct from acinar, pancreatic cells.",

Alloxan oxidizes GSH to GSSG. The rate of GSH oxidation at a given initial GSH concentration of 2.0 mmol/L depends on the initial concentration of alloxan added. The higher the concentration of alloxan in relation to the initial concentration of GSH, the faster GSH oxidation proceeds, as well as oxygen consumption, and therefore, formation of reactive oxygen species. The highest rates of GSH oxidation, i.e. GSSG formation, were found at concentration ratios of between 2.0 mmol/L GSH and 0.2 and 0.04 mmol/L alloxan, respectively. Because 0.04 mmol/L alloxan oxidizes 2.0 mmol/L GSH completely, a frequency of at least 25 cycles between alloxan and dialuric acid within 3 hours can be assumed. During each redox cycle, two molecules of GSH are oxidized to one molecule of GSSG, and during each cycle one molecule of oxygen is reduced simultaneously to one molecule of hydrogen peroxide. In total, therefore, one molecule of alloxan oxidizes at least 50 molecules of GSH and forms about 25 molecules of hydrogen peroxide.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The mechanism of their action in B cells of the pancreas has been intensively investigated and now is quite well understood. The cytotoxic action of both these diabetogenic agents is mediated by reactive oxygen species, however, the source of their generation is different in the case of alloxan and streptozotocin. Alloxan and the product of its reduction, dialuric acid, establish a redox cycle with the formation of superoxide radicals. These radicals undergo dismutation to hydrogen peroxide. Thereafter highly reactive hydroxyl radicals are formed by the Fenton reaction. The action of reactive oxygen species with a simultaneous massive increase in cytosolic calcium concentration causes rapid destruction of B cells. Streptozotocin enters the B cell via a glucose transporter (GLUT2) and causes alkylation of DNA. DNA damage induces activation of poly ADP-ribosylation, a process that is more important for the diabetogenicity of streptozotocin than DNA damage itself. Poly ADP-ribosylation leads to depletion of cellular NAD+ and ATP. Enhanced ATP dephosphorylation after streptozotocin treatment supplies a substrate for xanthine oxidase resulting in the formation of superoxide radicals. Consequently, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals are also generated. Furthermore, streptozotocin liberates toxic amounts of nitric oxide that inhibits aconitase activity and participates in DNA damage. As a result of the streptozotocin action, B cells undergo the destruction by necrosis.",

In laboratory animals, diabetes can be induced with alloxan (ALX), a 2,4,5,6-tetraoxopyrimidine. ALX is a potent generator of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can mediate beta-cell toxicity. However, the initial lesions on essential beta-cell structures are not known. In this study, we report that the glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and glucokinase (GK) are target molecules for ALX. Ex vivo, a gradual decrement of both GLUT2 and GK mRNA expression was found in islets isolated from ALX-treated C57BL/6 mice. This reduction was more pronounced for GLUT2 than for GK. The mRNA expression of beta-actin was also slightly affected with time after ALX exposure, the proinsulin mRNA, however, remained unaffected as well as the pancreatic total insulin content. Pretreatment with D-glucose (D-G) protected the mRNA expression of GLUT2 and GK against ALX toxicity and prevented diabetes. Yet, in these euglycemic mice, an impaired oral glucose tolerance persisted. Pretreatment with 5-thio-D-glucose (5-T-G) failed to prevent ALX diabetes, administration of zinc sulfate (Zn(2+))-enriched drinking water, however, reduced ALX-induced hyperglycemia. In conclusion, ALX exerted differential toxicity on beta-cell structures similar to in vitro results reported from this laboratory. Furthermore, the present results differ from those reported for the diabetogen streptozotocin (STZ). Injections of multiple low doses (MLD) of STZ reduced GLUT2 expression only, but failed to affect expression of GK and proinsulin as well as beta-actin as internal control. MLD-STZ diabetes was prevented by pretreatment with both D-G and 5-T-G and administration of Zn(2+)-enriched drinking water. Apparently, ALX and MLD-STZ exert diabetogenicity by different pathways requiring different interventional schedules for prevention.",

Human pancreatic islets were obtained from heart-beating organ donors. The expression of the stress proteins heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and heme oxygenase and the anti-apoptosis gene bcl-2 was determined in isolated rat, mouse, and human islets, either cultured in vitro or transplanted under the kidney capsule of nude mice, using immunoblot analysis. Rat and human islet sensitive hydrogen peroxide was assess by glucose oxidation measurements. Isolated islets were also analyzed for their catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, and the islet cell levels of reduced glutathione were determined in response to hydrogen peroxide and nitroprusside. Programmed cell death in human and rat islets in response to streptozotocin was evaluated using TUNEL staining. RESULTS: Cultured human islets expressed higher contents of hsp70 than mouse and rat islets at basal conditions. Also after 4 weeks under the kidney capsule of normoglycemic mice, the hsp70 levels were higher in human islets than in rat islets. The expression of another stress protein, heme oxygenase (HO), was strongly increased in cultured rat islets, but was not affected in human islets. Expression of the bcl-2 gene could not be detected in human islets. In spite of this, 0.5 mM streptozotocin induced apotosis in rat but not in human islet cells. Hydrogen peroxide (0.1 and 0.4 mM) decreased glucose oxidation rates in rat but not in human islets. The levels of reduced glutathione were moderately decreased in human and rat islet cells and sharply decreased in mouse islet cells in response to hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were markedly lower in mouse islets than in human islets. The activity of catalase was lower in rat islets than in human islets. CONCLUSION: Human islets differ clearly from mouse and rat islets in their increased expression of hsp70, catalase, and SOD, which may explain the increased resistance of human islets to beta cell toxins.",

The mechanism of DNA damage induced by alloxan was investigated using 32P-labeled human DNA fragments. Cu(II)-dependent DNA damage increased with the concentration of alloxan and NADH. Alloxan induced DNA cleavage frequently at thymine and cytosine residues in the presence of NADH and Cu(II). Catalase and bathocuproine, a Cu(I)-specific chelator, almost completely inhibited DNA damage, suggesting the involvement of H2O2 and Cu(I). Alloxan induced Cu(II)-dependent production of 8-oxodG in calf thymus DNA in the presence of NADH. UV-visible and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopic studies showed that superoxide anion radical and alloxan radical were generated by the reduction of alloxan by NADH, and also by the autoxidation of dialuric acid, the reduced form of alloxan. These results suggest that the copper-oxygen complex derived from the reaction of H2O2 with Cu(I) participates in Cu(II)-dependent DNA damage by alloxan plus NADH and dialuric acid. The mechanism of DNA damage is discussed in relation to diabetogenic action of alloxan.",

Alloxan was administered as a single dose (120 mg/kg BW) to induce diabetes. A dose of 1 mL of either onion or garlic juices/100 g body weight (equivalent to 0.4 g/100 g BW) was orally administered daily to alloxan-diabetic rats for four weeks. The levels of glucose, urea, creatinine and bilirubin were significantly (p<0.05) increased in plasma of alloxan-diabetic rats compared to the control group. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline and acid phosphatases (AlP, AcP) activities were significantly (p<0.05) increased in plasma and testes of alloxan-diabetic rats, while these activities were decreased in liver compared with the control group. Brain LDH was significantly (p<0.05) increased. The concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and the activity of glutathione S-transferase in plasma, liver, testes, brain, and kidney were increased in alloxan-diabetic rats. Treatment of the diabetic rats with repeated doses of either garlic or onion juices could restore the changes of the above parameters to their normal levels...",

After 5-8 days in tissue culture, human or rodent islets were exposed for 14 h to NP (50-200 microM) or for 30 min to SZ or alloxan (1-3 mM). Glucose oxidation by human islets was not reduced by NP, but there was a dose-dependent inhibition in rat (40-90% inhibition; P < 0.001) and mouse (10-60% inhibition; P < 0.05) islet glucose oxidation. Glucose (16.7 mM)-induced insulin release by human islets was not impaired after a 30-min exposure to SZ or alloxan, at concentrations that inhibited insulin release from rat (30-80% inhibition; P < 0.001) or mouse (10-70% inhibition; P < 0.05) islets. The viability of human beta cells purified by flow cytometry was not affected by SZ or alloxan (5 mM), as judged 1 or 4 days after a 10-min exposure and subsequent culture; these conditions were cytotoxic for rat beta cells, with 65-95% (P < 0.01) dead beta cells after 4 days. Human islets transplanted under the kidney capsule of nude mice were not affected by in vivo alloxan exposure, as suggested by preserved graft morphology and insulin content, whereas the endogenous beta cells of the transplanted mice were severely damage (80% decrease in pancreatic insulin content and morphological signs of beta-cell destruction). Thus human beta cells are resistant to NP, SZ, or alloxan at concentrations that decrease survival and function of rat or mouse beta cells. These marked interspecies differences emphasize the relevance of repair and/or defense mechanisms in beta-cell destruction and raise the possibility that such differences may also be present among individuals of the same species.",

When cell monolayers were exposed to D-[14C]glucose, the presence of alloxan (0.31-1.87 mM) resulted initially in a dose-dependent enhancement of total cell glucose incorporation. This was observed within 2 min and declined by 6 min. After that time, alloxan inhibited glucose incorporation. When hexose transport was examined directly using glucose analogues, alloxan neither enhanced nor inhibited the uptake of 3-O-methylglucose or 2-deoxyglucose. Alloxan exerted no effect on cell permeability or cell viability. These results suggest that alloxan may directly influence cell glucose metabolism beyond the level of phosphorylation. The dual effect of alloxan on glucose incorporation may be related to the alloxan stimulation and subsequent inhibition of glucose-induced insulin release in pancreatic islets.",

Culture medium (RPMI 1640) containing either 2.0 (low) or 11.1 (high) mM glucose was used during the alloxan exposure. Alloxan exposure lasted for 5 min at room temperature, with final concentrations of 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mM. Medium samples were collected for hormone assays on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 10 and islet insulin contents were measured on day 10 after alloxan treatment. Electron microscopy of ICCs was done 24 hr after the drug exposure. Control ICCs steadily increased their insulin secretion during the whole study period. Alloxan concentrations above 0.3 mM significantly (p < 0.01) decreased insulin secretion at the low glucose concentration. High glucose protected beta cells from alloxan toxicity. There was no difference in islet insulin contents between alloxan-treated and control cultures. Glucagon secretion by glucose media was not affected by alloxan exposure. All islet cells including beta cells remained intact in electron microscopy. The results suggest a block in insulin secretion by alloxan, but beta cells appear to recover at least partly in their insulin-secreting capacity.",

The present study ... examined the potential of known diabetogenic agents (streptozotocin (STZ) and alloxan (AL)), with different mechanisms of action, for induction of direct injury in an immortal human keratinocyte HaCat cell line. In contrast to STZ, which induces alkylation of DNA, a genotoxic effect of AL is achieved through reactive oxygen species. ... HaCat cells are highly sensitive to STZ, but not to AL. At a concentration of 10mM STZ, cell viability decreased to 32 +/-13% of control (P<0.05), as compared to 82 +/-14% with 10mM of AL. Cells treated with 10 and 20mM STZ showed a significant increase in apoptosis (3.9- and 6.7-fold), but not in necrosis, compared to naive cells (P<0.05). In contrast to STZ, no increase in apoptotic and necrotic cell death was observed after AL treatment. Pretreatment with non-metabolizable 3-O-methyl glucose (3-OMG), which can blockade glucose transporter, or with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (nicotinamide or 3-aminobenzamide), did not protect keratinocytes from STZ injury. ... STZ, but not AL, /was/ highly toxic to the HaCat cell line. Unlike insulin-producing cells, STZ-induced injury of immortal human keratinocyte HaCat cells is independent of the glucose transporters as well as of the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.",

A single iv dose of alloxan... frequently induced proliferative lesions of squamous epithelium in tongue, esophagus and forestomach of male and female WBN/Kob rats, and hastened the onset and acceleration of diabetic conditions. Histopathologically, proliferative changes of squamous cell of forestomach varied with the severity of hyperplasia in alloxan-treated rats (100% of 31 males and 94.1% of 17 females) and progressed to SCC in approximately 20% of all rats. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes was also observed in two cases. Proliferative changes were most severe in the forestomach and were constantly accompanied with chronic suppurative inflammation of the mucosal epithelium with infection of filamentous fungi and/or bacterial colonies. In contrast, forestomach of the spontaneously diabetic male rats showed only slight hyperplasia of the mucosal epithelium confined to the limiting ridge in approximately 30% of the cases. All non-diabetic female rats showed neither proliferative changes nor the inflammatory process in the mucosa. Immunohistochemically, COX-2 and iNOS were positive in these chronic suppurative inflammatory lesions accompanied by proliferative squamous epithelium. From these results, it is suggested that chronic inflammatory processes play an important role in the pathogenesis of alloxan-induced SCC. ...[Kodama Y et al; Cancer Sci. 2006 Oct;97(10):1023-30 (2006)]",

Hyperglycemia was rarely produced at alloxan doses from 80 to 100 mg/kg, and the frequency of malformations observed was low. Higher doses (110 to 150 mg/kg) caused severe hyperglycemia, and maternal or embryonic death. When 110 mg/kg was administered on Day 4 of gestation (the day before embryo implantation), all rats had resorption nodules and litters with embryos with delayed growth. We recommend the induction of diabetes mellitus on Day 4 of pregnancy for studies of diabetes-gestation interaction.[Palomar-Morales M et al; Reprod Toxicol 12 (6): 659-65 (1998)]",

In this investigation, 6 apparently healthy adult male dogs were ...divided in two groups /and/...diabetes mellitus was induced in one group by intravenous (iv) injection of alloxan (100 mg/kg). Dogs with a fasting blood glucose (FBS) of more than 200 mg/dL were considered to be diabetic. Four weeks following induction of diabetes mellitus, ...livers and whole reproductive systems, including the testes, penis, urethra, and prostate, were dissected. The epididymides, corpus cavernosum, corpus spongiosum, penile urethra, and vas deferens were also dissected and removed from the reproductive tract.  The results showed significantly (P<0.05) increased arginase specific activity (ASA) in the liver, epididymis, prostate, corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum of the diabetic dogs. In the reproductive system of the diabetic dog, the maximum and minimum ASA was seen in the corpus cavernosum and testes, respectively (105.12 +/- 8.76 vs. 25.0 +/- 0.55). No such variation was observed in the ASA of normal dogs (39.0 +/- 5.47 vs. 25.0 +/- 5.47). There was no significant difference in plasma testosterone level between the groups. In conclusion, diabetes increased the ASA in liver, prostate, epididymis, corpora cavernosa, and corpora spongiosum of the male dogs and may contribute to erectile dysfunction or low fertility in diabetics.",

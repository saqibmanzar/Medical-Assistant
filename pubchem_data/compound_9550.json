When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

                                "Description": "Log P is the partition coefficient expressed in logarithmic form.  The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

Presently, the USA Environmental Protection Agency recommends the bubbler method and the Diazald kit for methyl esterification of acidic herbicides and other related compounds. The proposed modified procedure will be more convenient and safer to operate than either of these two methods, thus eliminating their tedious nature and potential hazards. In this study, the Aldrich MNNG (N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine) Diazomethane Kit is modified. Diazald is the reagent used instead of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine because of its large scale production of diazomethane, fast reaction time, safety, and stability. The whole esterification procedure takes about 40 min. It can simultaneously esterify many samples and it yields consistent results.",

Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure of humans to diazomethane may cause irritation of the eyes, cough, wheezing, asthmatic symptoms, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, dizziness, weakness, headache, and chest pains. No information is available on the chronic (long-term), reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of diazomethane in humans. Increased incidences of lung tumors have been observed in rats and mice exposed to diazomethane by inhalation and in dermally exposed mice.

Explosive limits specify the concentration range of a material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an ignition source.

The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

In addition, this section contains information on appropriate engineering controls (e.g., use local exhaust ventilation, or use only in an enclosed system) as well as recommendations for personal protective measures to prevent illness or injury from exposure to chemicals, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., appropriate types of eye, face, skin or respiratory protection needed based on hazards and potential exposure).",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The occurrence of disease or other work-related adverse health effects should prompt immediate evaluation of primary preventive measures (e.g., industrial hygiene monitoring, engineering controls, and personal protective equipment).

These should concentrate on the function and integrity of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.94X10+3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diazomethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase diazomethane will undergo rapid hydrolysis with atmospheric water vapor but may be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals at a much slower rate; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 days. Diazomethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Since diazomethane is a gas and reacts rapidly with water, volatilization from water or soil is not relevant. Similarly, adsorption to soil/sediments, bioconcentration, and biodegradation are not expected due to the rapid rate of decomposition under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to diazomethane may occur through inhalation if the gas supplied in its pure form or when it is formed in situ during organic syntheses. Dermal contact with solutions of this compound in organic solvents may also occur at workplaces where diazomethane is produced or used. The general population is not likely to be exposed to  diazomethane since it is primarily used in a laboratory setting. (SRC)",

Gas-phase diazomethane will undergo rapid hydrolysis with atmospheric water vapor but may also be degraded by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals at a much slower rate(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 9.34X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). The rate constant for the gas-phase reaction of diazomethane with ozone was 3.3X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec(4).

When a large excess if diazoalkane was used, the kinetics were zero order in diazoalkane abd first order in acid for the pH range 4<pH<5.5. The pH rode dramatically at the start of the reaction: the pH rise was measured by use of a novel continuous-flow system. Combination of the kinetic and pH data allowed estimation of the protonation rate as 4X10+8/M-sec. Isotope-exchange studies showed that water deprotonates the methanediazonium ion less rapidly than it displaces nitrogen; however, the hydroxide ion reacts more rapidly as a base than as a nucleophile. The rates of nucleophillic attack of water and the hydroxide ion on the methanediazoonium ion were estimated as 1.8/sec and 1X10+4 /M-sec, respectively, in THF-water (60:40 v/v).

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

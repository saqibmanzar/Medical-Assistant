When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

With a typical batch process, the toluene is fed into the nitrator and cooled to about 25 \u00b0C. The nitrating acid (52-56 wt% H2SO4, 28-32 wt% HNO3, and 12-20 wt% H2O) is added slowly below the surface of the toluene and the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 25 \u00b0C by adjusting the feed rate of the nitrating acid and the amount of cooling. After all of the acid is added, the temperature is raised slowly to 35-40 \u00b0C. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is put into a separator where the spent acid is withdrawn from the bottom and is reconcentrated. The crude product is washed in several steps with dilute caustic and then water. The product is steam distilled to remove excess toluene and then dried by distilling the remaining traces of water. The resulting product contains 55-60 wt% o-nitrotoluene, 3-4 wt% m-nitrotoluene, and 35-40 wt% p-nitrotoluene. The yield of mononitrotoluenes is about 96%. ... The separation of the isomers is carried out by a combination of fractional distillation and crystallization.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this bitter-almond-smelling, white-to-yellowish, crystalline substance may occur from its manufacture and use in the synthesis of dinitrotoluene, trinitrotoluene, and various azo and sulfur dye intermediates such as p-toluidine, p-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-nitro-2-chlorotoluene.  Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, headache, weakness, dizziness, nausea, shortness-of-breath, tachycardia, and methemoglobinemia. The onset of symptoms may be delayed up to 4 hours. OSHA has set a time-weighted-average (TWA) limit of 2 ppm as a final rule to become effective December 31, 1992. Local exhaust ventilation should be applied to control airborne 4-nitrotoluene to permissible limits.  In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and chemical protective clothing which is specifically recommended by the shipper or manufacturer.  If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water.  Contaminated clothing should be removed and left at the site for cleaning.  While 4-nitrotoluene does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of irritating or poisonous gases. Also, containers of this substance may explode violently in the heat of a fire. For fires involving 4-nitrotoluene, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or standard foam.  Fight fire from as far a distance as possible, and if fire is advanced, evacuate the area.  Dike fire control water. 4-Nitrotoluene should be stored away from sources of ignition, heat, strong oxidizers, and sulfuric acid. Small spills of 4-nitrotoluene should be carefully shovelled into a clean, dry container  and covered loosely (liquid solutions are taken up with vermiculite, dry sand, or earth).  Large dry spills on land should be covered with a plastic sheet to prevent dissolving in the rain or firefighting water, until removal is possible. Large liquid solution spills on land should be diked far ahead of the spill and not allowed to enter water sources or sewers. Spills into bodies of water should be trapped at the bottom with sand bag barriers and removed with suction hoses, or treated with activated carbon and the resulting immobilized masses removed with mechanical dredges or lifts.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Livers were removed and analyzed for total and covalently bound radiolabel. Maximal concentrations of total radiolabel were observed between 3 and 12 hr after the dose, and there were no large differences among the 3 isomers in peak concentrations achieved. Covalent binding to hepatic macromolecules was maximal 12 hrs after administration for all 3 isomers. Thereafter, concentration of covalently bound 2-nitrotoluene derived material were always 2-6 times higher than those of 3- or 4-nitrotoluene derived material. When DNA was isolated from livers of rats given mononitrotoluene isomers 12 hrs previously, only 2-nitrotoluene was observed to covalently bind at concentration above the limits of detection of the assay. The covalent binding of 2-nitrotoluene, but not that of 3- or 4-nitrotoluene, to both total hepatic macromolecules and DNA was markedly decreased by prior administration of pentachlorophenol or 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol. Covalent binding to hepatic DNA was decreased by >96%. Thus, 2-nitrotoluene, but not 3- or 4-nitrotoluene, induces DNA excision repair. Furthermore, 2-nitrotoluene, like the hepatocarcinogen 2,6-dinitrotoluene, may require the action of sulfotransferase for its conversion to a species capable of covalently binding to hepatic DNA.",

Survival of all exposed groups of rats was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of 5,000 ppm male and 2,500 and 5,000 ppm female rats were less than those of the controls during most of the study; mean body weights of 1,250 ppm females were less during the second year of the study. Feed consumption by 5,000 ppm females was less than that by the controls during year 2 of the study. Two urinary metabolites were followed during the study as biomarkers of exposure. The ratios of p-nitrobenzoic acid to creatinine and of p-acetamidobenzoic acid to creatinine determined at 2 weeks and at 3, 12, and 18 months were linearly related to exposure concentration in males and females. The incidence of clitoral gland adenoma or carcinoma (combined) was significantly greater in 2,500 ppm females than that in the controls and exceeded the historical control ranges. The incidence of clitoral gland neoplasms was not increased in 5,000 ppm females, possibly because of the lower body weights in this group. The incidences of subcutaneous fibroma and of subcutaneous fibroma or fibrosarcoma (combined) in 2,500 ppm male rats were significantly increased and exceeded the historical control ranges. The incidences of several nonneoplastic kidney lesions were significantly increased in exposed groups of rats, and the severities of these lesions generally increased with increasing exposure concentration. In the spleen, incidences of hematopoietic cell proliferation and pigmentation were significantly increased in the 2,500 and 5,000 ppm groups. Significantly increased incidences of various types of altered cell foci in the liver of males and females were associated with exposure. Incidences of germinal epithelial atrophy of the testis in 5,000 ppm males and endometrial cystic hyperplasia of the uterus in 2,500 and 5,000 ppm females were significantly increased. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were significantly decreased in all exposed groups except 1,250 ppm females. The incidence of interstitial cell adenoma of the testis in 5,000 ppm males was significantly decreased.",

There were no effects on survival in any of the studies, and clinical signs of toxicity were limited to decreases in feed consumption. Decreased body weight gains occurred in dosed rats ... in all studies at the higher dose levels and were most pronounced in rats receiving o-nitrotoluene.  In rats, histopathologic analyses after 13 weeks of dosing showed toxicity to kidney, spleen, and testis in animals receiving any of the 3 isomers, and toxicity to the liver and mesothelium in male rats given o-nitrotoluene. Kidney toxicity observed in male rats was characterized by the presence of hyaline droplets in tubular epithelial cells, attributed to an increase in the level of a-2u globulin. Pigment, possibly lipofuscin, and karyomegaly in the p-nitrotoluene study were present in the renal tubular epithelium of dosed male and female rats. In the spleen of treated male and female rats, there was a mild increase in hematopoiesis, hemosiderin deposition, and/or congestion; this effect was most severe with the para-isomer, followed by the ortho- and then the meta-isomer. Administration of o-, m-, or p-nitrotoluene impaired testicular function of the rat, shown by degeneration of the testis and reduction in sperm concentration, motility, and spermatid number. All 3 isomers increased the length of the estrous cycle in rats. Hepatic toxicity was characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization and oval cell hyperplasia and by an increase in the level of serum bile acids, SDH, and ALT activities in male rats given o-nitrotoluene. There was no histopathologic evidence for liver toxicity in male or female rats with the m- or p-isomers, or in female rats with the o-isomer; but evidence of liver injury was observed in these groups, indicated by increases in relative liver weights and elevations in bile acids and liver enzymes in serum. Mesotheliomas of the tunica vaginalis were observed in 3/10 male rats receiving o-nitrotoluene at 5000 ppm, and mesothelial cell hyperplasia was observed in 2/10 male rats receiving o-nitrotoluene at 10000 ppm.",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 0.0157 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-nitrotoluene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-nitrotoluene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 days. 4-Nitrotoluene is susceptible to direct photolysis, with the primary photoproduct being 4-methyl-2-nitrophenol. If released to soil, 4-nitrotoluene is expected to have high to moderate mobility based upon a measured Koc value of 138 for a single sediment and an estimated Koc value of 363. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.63X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 4-Nitrotoluene (at 100 ppm) reached 0.8% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test which indicates the compound is not readily biodegradable. However, two studies demonstrated that 4-nitrotoluene could be completely biodegraded by unacclimated sludge within two weeks when lower concentrations of 4-nitrotoluene (10 ppm) were used. Studies using adapted inocula have demonstrated that 4-nitrotoluene can biodegrade readily. If released into water, 4-nitrotoluene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon the Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.8 and 60 days, respectively. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. In aqueous solution, 4-nitrotoluene has a quantum yield of 0.0046 at 313 nm indicating that it is susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. BCF values of 3.7 to 8.0 in carp suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The most probable route of human exposure to 4-nitrotoluene is dermal contact of workers involved in the production and use of this compound, as well as in the production of dinitrotoluene and trinitrotoluene. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 4-nitrotoluene via inhalation of ambient air in the vicinity of production facilites and ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

Two studies demonstrated that 4-nitrotoluene could be completely biodegraded by unacclimated sludge within two weeks when lower concentrations of 4-nitrotoluene (10 ppm) were used(7,8). Studies using adapted inocula have demonstrated that 4-nitrotoluene can biodegrade readily(9,10).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.63X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.8 days and 60 days, respectively(SRC). In aqueous solution, 4-nitrotoluene has a quantum yield of 0.0046 at 313 nm(6) indicating that it is susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). 4-Nitrotoluene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(4). According to a classification scheme(7), measured BCF values of 3.7 to 8.0 in carp (Carprinus carpio)(8) suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 4-Nitrotoluene (at 100 ppm) reached 0.8% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test which indicates the compound is not readily biodegradable(8). Two studies demonstrated that 4-nitrotoluene could be completely biodegraded by unacclimated sludge within two weeks when lower concentrations of 4-nitrotoluene (10 ppm) were used(9,10). Studies using adapted inocula have demonstrated that 4-nitrotoluene can biodegrade readily(11,12).",

Vapor-phase 4-nitrotoluene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.7X10-13 cu  cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 4-Nitrotoluene is susceptible to direct photolysis, with the primary photoproduct being 4-methyl-2-nitrophenol(4).",

Two studies demonstrated that 4-nitrotoluene could be completely degraded by unacclimated sludge withing two weeks when lower concentrations of 4-nitrotoluene (10 ppm) were used(2,3). When nitrotoluene-adapted activated sludges were used as an inoculum, however, 4-nitrotoluene was almost completely degraded (~98%) within 5 days, even when higher concentrations (200 mg/L) of 4-nitrotoluene were used(4). 2-Amino-4-methylphenol has been identified as a microbial degradation product of 4-nitrotoluene(5). Using a mixed culture isolated from a contaminated soil (near an ammunition plant), 4-nitrotoluene (at initial concentrations of 5 mg/L) degraded completely in 1 to 3 days in aerobic batch and continuous reactor tests(6).",

Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The recoveries were estimated using the internal and external standard methods. The recovery of the compounds was almost negligible when TEA was used as IP reagent. The recoveries obtained when TBAB and CTAB were used as IP reagents were high and reproducible. The recovery of test chemicals is above 90%, except for methyl phosphonic acid and ethylphosphonic acid (20.6 +/- 3.2% and 35.8 +/- 2.5%, respectively). The minimum detection limits of the method were calculated for all chemicals in both full scan and selected ion monitoring modes.

The amount of the parent compound in the urine as well as the two major metabolites, 3-quinuclidinol (Q) and benzilic acid (BA), was determined because the relationship between QNB dose and levels of QNB and its metabolites in human urine is not known. QNB was determined in urine samples spiked at a target level of 0.5 ng/mL, and the metabolites BA and Q were determined at a target level of 5 ng/mL. The method uses solid-phase extraction to isolate each analyte from the urine and isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for quantitation. Each analyte is converted to its trimethylsilyl derivative for analysis. The analytical method was tested on eight different urine samples spiked with known amounts of the analytes near the target levels, at 10 times the target",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.3X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzilic acid will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate phase benzilic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Benzilic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzilic acid is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 420. The pKa of benzilic acid is 3.05, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anionic form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. A 0% of theoretical BOD in the Japanese MITI test indicates that biodegradation is not an important fate process. If released into water, benzilic acid is expected to adsorb moderately to suspended solids and sediment based upon a Koc of 420. The pKa indicates benzilic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. A BCF of <0.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to benzilic acid may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact at workplaces where benzilic acid is produced or used. Limited exposure to the general population may occur due to its use as an intermediate in synthesis of the drug clidinium bromide, an anticholinergic. (SRC)",

A pKa of 3.05(4) indicates benzilic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

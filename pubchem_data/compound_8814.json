ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Metabolites were detected using HPLC and LC/MS. In this study 4-tert-octylphenol was shown to be metabolized by hydroxylation and subsequent glucuronidation or glucuronidation alone. The metabolites were identified as hydroxyl-tert-4-tert-octylphenol glucuronide, hydroxyl-tert-4-tert-octylphenol, tertoctylcatechol-glucuronide, 4-tert-4-tert-octylphenol-glucuronide, 4-tert-octylcatechol unchanged 4-tert-4-tert-octylphenol. Glucuronides were shown to be excreted into the bile (38% of the perfused substrate) and were detected in liver tissue in SD rats. In EHBR rats only 32 % of perfused 4-tert-octylphenol were recovered almost all of which (approximately 68 %) was found in the hepatic vein (and not in the bile or the livers). In a second part or the study an UDP-glucuronosyltransferase assay was performed. Yeast cells expressing several isoforms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, and UGT2B1) were incubated with 4-tert-octylphenol. In this test only the UGT2B1 isoform metabolized 4-tert-octylphenol with a Vmax of 11 nmol/min/mg and Km of 94 uM. Conversion of 4-tert-octylphenol was also measured in vitro in microsomes of liver, kidney, intestine and testis of rats as well as in human liver microsomes. Liver, rat and human, as well as rat intestine showed the highest conversion rate. Vmax and km were determined to be 7.7, 3.8 and 2.75 nmol/min/mg or 57, 24 and 125 uM, respectively.",

It is mainly metabolized into glucuronide by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes in mammals. In the present study, the glucuronidation of 4-tOP in humans, monkeys, rats, and mice was examined in an in vitro system using microsomal fractions. The kinetics of 4-tOP glucuronidation by liver microsomes followed the Michaelis-Menten model for humans and monkeys, and the biphasic model for rats and mice. The K m, V max, and CL int values of human liver microsomes were 0.343 uM, 11.6 nmol/min/mg protein, and 33.8 mL/min/mg protein, respectively. The kinetics of intestine microsomes followed the Michaelis-Menten model for humans, monkeys, and rats, and the biphasic model for mice. The K m, V max, and CL int values of human intestine microsomes were 0.743 uM, 0.571 nmol/min/mg protein, and 0.770 mL/min/mg protein, respectively. The CL int values estimated by Eadie-Hofstee plots were in the order of mice (high-affinity phase) (3.0) > humans (1.0) = monkeys (0.9) > rats (high-affinity phase) (0.4) for liver microsomes, and monkeys (10) > mice (high-affinity phase) (5.6) > rats (1.4) > humans (1.0) for intestine microsomes. The percentages of the CL int values of intestine microsomes to liver microsomes were in the order of monkeys (27 %) > rats (high-affinity phase in liver microsomes) (7.9 %) > mice (high-affinity phase in liver and intestine microsomes) (4.2 %) > humans (2.3 %). These results suggest that the metabolic abilities of UGT enzymes expressed in the liver and intestine toward 4-tOP markedly differ among species and imply that species differences are strongly associated with the toxicities of alkylphenols.",

It is mainly metabolized into glucuronide by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes in humans. The purpose of this study was to assess inter-individual variability in and the possible roles of UGT isoforms in hepatic 4-tOP glucuronidation in the humans. 4-tOP glucuronidation activities in the liver microsomes and recombinant UGTs of humans were assessed at broad substrate concentrations, and kinetics were analyzed. Correlation analyses between 4-tOP and diclofenac or 4-hydroxybiphenyl activities in pooled and individual human liver microsomes were also performed. Typical CLint values were 17.8 mL/min/mg protein for the low type, 25.2 mL/min/mg protein for the medium type, and 47.7 mL/min/mg protein for the high type. Among the recombinant UGTs (13 isoforms) examined, UGT2B7 and UGT2B15 were the most active of catalyzing 4-tOP glucuronidation. Although the K m values of UGT2B7 and UGT2B15 were similar (0.36 and 0.42 uM, respectively), the CLint value of UGT2B7 (6.83 mL/min/mg protein) >UGT2B15 (2.35 mL/min/mg protein). Strong correlations were observed between the glucuronidation activities of 4-tOP and diclofenac (a probe for UGT2B7) or 4-hydroxybiphenyl (a probe for UGT2B15) with 0.79-0.88 of Spearman correlation coefficient (r s) values. These findings demonstrate that 4-tOP glucuronidation in humans is mainly catalyzed by hepatic UGT2B7 and UGT2B15, and suggest that these UGT isoforms play important and characteristic roles in the detoxification of 4-tOP.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Several man-made chemicals are constantly released into the environment during the manufacturing process and by leaching from the industrial products. As a result, human and animal populations are exposed to these synthetic chemicals on a regular basis. Many of these chemicals have adverse effects on the physiological functions, particularly on the hormone systems in human and animals and are called endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Bisphenol A (BPA), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP), and 4-nonylphenol (NP) are three high volume production EDCs that are widely used for industrial purposes and are present ubiquitously in the environment. Bisphenol A is metabolized in the human body to a more potent compound (MBP: 4-Methyl-2, 4-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) pent-1-ene). Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown the three EDCs to be associated with adverse effects on reproductive system in human and animals. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a circulatory protein that binds sex steroids and is a potential target for endocrine disruptors in the human body. The current study was done in order to understand the binding mechanism of OP, BPA, NP, and MBP with human SHBG using in silico approaches. All four compounds showed high binding affinity with SHBG, however, the binding affinity values were higher (more negative) for MBP and NP than for OP and BPA. The four ligands interacted with 19-23 residues of SHBG and a consistent overlapping of the interacting residues for the four ligands with the residues for the natural ligand, dihydrotestosterone (DHT; 82-91% commonality) was shown. The overlapping SHBG interacting residues among DHT and the four endocrine disruptors suggested that these compounds have potential for interference and disruption in the steroid binding function.",

The reaction temperature is maintained at 100 - 105 \u00b0C by internal cooling coils. The resin, with an exchange capacity of ca. 400 meq H+/100 g, is kept in the hydrated form (water content 10 - 15%) by using phenol with a water content of 1 - 2 wt%. The water decreases the catalyst activity to a desired level, thus spreading the evolution of reaction heat and effectively suppressing the depolymerization of diisobutene, and, consequently, the formation of 4-tert-butylphenol. The reaction is carried out to a diisobutene conversion of about 95%. The reaction product is distilled to remove water, diisobutene, and phenol and has the following composition: 0.5 - 1% 4-tert-butylphenol, 2 - 3% 2-tert-octylphenol, 93 - 96% 4-tert-octylphenol, and 2 - 3% dialkylphenols. The product can be purified further by fractionation under vacuum.",

HUMAN STUDIES: tOP is a skin and eye irritant. An epidemiological study suggested significant negative associations between maternal urinary tOP concentrations and neonatal sizes at birth. ANIMAL STUDIES: tOP produced eye and skin irritation in rabbits. tOP was evaluated for subchronic dietary toxicity through administration to rats for 3 months. For all concentrations, food intake and death rates were not influenced by treatment. Toxic signs included decreased weight gain. Females had reduced hematocrit and thyroxin values. Neonatal exposure to a high-dose tOP enhanced uterine carcinogenesis in rats, and the type of uterine tumors was changed by the periods of neonatal exposure to tOP, suggesting that the mechanism of uterine tumor development is dependent upon neonatal exposure periods. A reproduction/developmental screening test was conducted in the rat. tOP was administered at dosages of 125, 250 or 500 mg/kg/day, once daily by gavage for two weeks prior to mating, throughout the two weeks mating period, and until litters reached day 4 post partum. Slight impairment of the mating performance and development of the conceptus, observed as a reduced conception and implantation rate, a prolonged duration of pregnancy and a developmental delay, only occured at 500 mg/kg/day. tOP interfered with uterine contractility in immature rats. tOP exposure caused dose-dependent maturation of oviducts in both male and female frogs. tOP has been shown to exert estrogenic effects on mammalian cells in culture. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: tOP is a prevalent environmental pollutant that has been shown to exert both toxic and estrogenic effects on mammalian cells. In male bank voles, treatment for 60 days adversely influenced weights and histological structure of the testes and seminal vesicles. In these tissues, expression of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and androgen receptor and testosterone levels were reduced, whereas expression of aromatase and estrogen receptor a and estradiol levels were increased. Short-term exposure to the tOP and the natural estrogen 17beta-estradiol changed important sexual characteristics in the adult male guppy. Both compounds increased the number of sperm cells in the ejaculates, reduced the area and color intensity of the sexually attractive orange spots, and inhibited testis growth. The effect of various concentrations of tOP (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 mg/L) was studied in an aquatic plant, the submersed macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum. The toxic effect caused by tOP inhibited the plant's growth rate, reduced total chlorophyll content and increased levels of the reactive oxygen species. tOP treatment significantly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase, guaiacol peroxidase, glutathione reductase and ascorbate peroxidase.",

The obtained results revealed that rats which received 4-tert-OP showed a significant increase in liver TBARS and bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) activities. While a significant decrease in the levels of GSH, SOD, catalase recorded. On the other hand, CFR extract succeeded to modulate these observed abnormalities resulting from 4-tert-OP as indicated by the reduction of TBARS and the pronounced improvement of the investigated biochemical and antioxidant parameters. Histopathological evidence, together with observed PCNA and DNA fragmentation, supported the detrimental effect of 4-tert-OP and the ameliorating effect of CFR extract on liver toxicity. So, it could be concluded that chicory has a promising role and it worth to be considered as a natural substance for ameliorating the oxidative stress and hepatic injury induced by 4-tert-OP compound.",

To extend previous studies, the measured additional potential interactions among bisphenol A (BPA), 4-nonylphenol (NP), 4-tert octylphenol (OP) and isobutylparaben (IBP) in mouse model were observed. Pregnant Swiss-albino mice were treated with binary combined chemicals (5, 50 or 500 mg/kg/bw/day) from gestation day (GD) 1 to 21. Interestingly, maternal exposure to these EDCs caused fluctuation in GD time, live ratio, female/male ratio, body and organ weights of mouse offspring at postnatal day (PND) 1, 21, and 41 days. At most doses early reduced 0.85 to 1.87 GD compared to controls. Besides females/males ratio showed a significant difference in BPA+ OP, BPA+IBP groups. Female body weight at PND 21 and 41, showed a significant reduction at all combined levels, whereas male offspring showed reduction in weight at dose 50 mg/kg/bw/day. The potential effects of synergic estrogenicity detected histopathological abnormities, such as ovary analysis revealed increase of corpora lutea, cystic follicles and an endometrial hypertrophy and morphometric changes in uteri measurement. Taken together, these results provided an additional insight into synergistic effects of EDCs toxicology on reproductive tracts.",

Chlorogenic acid is the major dietary polyphenol present in various foods and beverages. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective role of chlorogenic acid in anemia and mineral disturbance occurring in OP toxicity in rats. Thirty-two male albino rats were divided into four equal groups (8 rats/group) as follows. The first (control) group was treated daily with an oral dose of 1 mL saline for two weeks. The second group was treated daily with an oral dose of 60 mg chlorogenic acid/kg body weight for two weeks. The third and fourth groups received daily intraperitoneal (ip) injections with 100 mg OP/kg body weight for two weeks; the fourth group was treated daily with an oral dose of 60 mg chlorogenic acid/kg body weight for three weeks starting one week before OP injections. The results revealed that OP induced significant decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells, mean cell volume, mean cell hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, white blood cells, lymphocyte and neutrophil percent, transferrin receptor, serum calcium, phosphorous, sodium, potassium, chloride, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase. Moreover, significant increases in serum hepcidin, ferritin, transferrin, erythropoietin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, creatinine, selenium, zinc, manganese, copper, iron, malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl levels were found in OP groups. OP exposure also induced cell apoptosis. Chlorogenic acid pretreatment in OP-treated groups restored all the mentioned parameters to approach the normal values. In conclusion, chlorogenic acid protects from anemia and mineral disturbances in 4-tert-octylphenol toxicity by ameliorating oxidative stress and apoptosis.",

We measured urinary tOP concentrations in 1100 pregnant women before their delivery, and examined whether tOP levels were associated with birth outcomes, including weight, length, head circumference and ponderal index at birth. tOP could be detected in all samples, and the median uncorrected and creatinine-corrected tOP concentrations were 0.90 ug/L (range from 0.25 to 20.05 ug/L) and 1.33 ug/g creatinine (range from 0.15 to 42.49 ug/g creatinine), respectively. Maternal urinary log-transformed tOP concentrations were significantly negatively associated with adjusted birth weight [beta (g) = -126; 95% confidence interval (CI): -197, -55], birth length [beta (cm) = -0.53; 95% CI:-0.93, -0.14], and head circumference [beta (cm) = -0.30; 95% CI: -0.54, -0.07], respectively. Additionally, considering sex difference, these significant negative associations were also found among male neonates, while only higher maternal tOP concentrations were associated with a significant decrease in birth weight among female neonates. This study suggested significant negative associations between maternal urinary tOP concentrations and neonatal sizes at birth, and they differed by neonatal sex. Further epidemiological studies are required to more fully elaborate the associations between prenatal tOP exposure and birth outcomes.",

Cathepsins are proteases that have been implicated in cancer progression. However, there have been few studies about the association between cathepsins and estrogenic chemicals during the cancer progression. In this study, we examined the effect(s) of 4-tert-octylphenol (OP), a potent EDC, on the expression of cathepsins B and D in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and a xenograft mouse model. Treatment with OP significantly induced the proliferation MCF-7 cells in an MTT assay. In addition, the expression of cathepsins B and D was markedly enhanced in MCF-7 cells at both the transcriptional and the translational levels following treatment with E2 or OP up to 48 hr. These results demonstrated the ability of OP to disrupt normal transcriptional regulation of cathepsins B and D in human breast cancer cells. However, the effects of OP on cell growth or overexpression of cathepsins by inhibiting ER-mediated signaling were abolished by an ER antagonist and siRNA specific for ERa. In conclusion, our findings suggest that OP at 10(-6)M, like E2, may accelerate breast cancer cell proliferation and the expression of cathepsins through an ER-mediated signaling pathway. In addition, the breast cancer cells exposed with OP to a xenograft mouse model were more aggressive according to our histological analysis and showed markedly increased expression of cathepsin B. These effects of mouse model resulted in an increased potential for metastasis in breast cancer. Taken together, we determined that OP can adversely affect human health by promoting cancer proliferation and metastasis through the amplification of cathepsins B and D via the ER-mediated signaling pathway.",

Several man-made chemicals are constantly released into the environment during the manufacturing process and by leaching from the industrial products. As a result, human and animal populations are exposed to these synthetic chemicals on a regular basis. Many of these chemicals have adverse effects on the physiological functions, particularly on the hormone systems in human and animals and are called endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Bisphenol A (BPA), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP), and 4-nonylphenol (NP) are three high volume production EDCs that are widely used for industrial purposes and are present ubiquitously in the environment. Bisphenol A is metabolized in the human body to a more potent compound (MBP: 4-Methyl-2, 4-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) pent-1-ene). Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown the three EDCs to be associated with adverse effects on reproductive system in human and animals. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a circulatory protein that binds sex steroids and is a potential target for endocrine disruptors in the human body. The current study was done in order to understand the binding mechanism of OP, BPA, NP, and MBP with human SHBG using in silico approaches. All four compounds showed high binding affinity with SHBG, however, the binding affinity values were higher (more negative) for MBP and NP than for OP and BPA. The four ligands interacted with 19-23 residues of SHBG and a consistent overlapping of the interacting residues for the four ligands with the residues for the natural ligand, dihydrotestosterone (DHT; 82-91% commonality) was shown. The overlapping SHBG interacting residues among DHT and the four endocrine disruptors suggested that these compounds have potential for interference and disruption in the steroid binding function.",

In this paper, to evaluate the toxicity of the alkylphenols at the protein level, the effects of 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) and 4-nonylphenol (NP) on human serum albumin (HSA) were characterized by molecular modeling, steady state and time-resolved fluorescence, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). The enthalpy change (deltaH) and entropy change (deltaS) indicated that hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonds were the dominant intermolecular forces in the binding of the alkylphenols to HSA. The binding constant of HSA-NP is much greater than that of HSA-OP, revealing that NP, which has a longer carbon chain, has a higher affinity than OP. The alterations of protein secondary structure in the presence of the alkylphenols were confirmed by UV-vis and CD spectroscopy. The time-resolved fluorescence study showed that the lifetimes of tryptophan (Trp) residue of HSA decreased after the addition of the alkylphenols, NP with longer carbon chain impact on the average lifetime of the Trp of HSA more than OP, which is consistent with the conclusion drawn from the fluorescence date.",

Bisphenol A (BPA; 4,4'-(propane-2,2-diyl)diphenol) and 4-tert-octylphenol (OP; 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol) are among the most common environmental contaminants possessing endocrine disruption properties and are present in plastics, epoxy resins, detergents and other commercial products of common personal and industrial use. A metabolite of BPA, 4-Methyl-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)pent-1-ene (MBP) is about 1000 times more biologically active compared to BPA. Epidemiological, clinical, and experimental studies have shown association of BPA and OP with adverse effects on male and female reproductive system in human and animals. The endocrine disruption activity can occur through multiple pathways including binding to steroid receptors. Androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor (PR) are critical for reproductive tract growth and function. Structural binding characterization of BPA, MBP, and OP with AR and PR using molecular docking simulation approaches revealed novel interactions of BPA with PR, and MBP and OP with AR and PR. For BPA, MBP, and OP, five AR interacting residues Leu-701, Leu-704, Asn-705, Met-742, and Phe-764 overlapped with those of native AR ligand testosterone, and four PR interacting residues Leu-715, Leu-718, Met-756, and Met-759 overlapped with those of PR co-complex ligand, norethindrone. For both the receptors the binding strength of MBP was maximum among the three compounds. Thus, these compounds have the potential to block or interfere in the binding of the endogenous native AR and PR ligands and, hence, resulting in dysfunction. The knowledge of the key interactions and the important amino-acid residues also allows better prediction of potential of xenobiotic molecules for disrupting AR- and PR-mediated pathways, thus, helping in design of less potent alternatives for commercial use.",

Target organs were liver and kidney. Kidney: In the kidneys of high dosage group rats, microscopic changes seen were basophilic epithelium with occasional mitotic figures in proximal tubules (males: 4 of 5, females 5 of 5; control: females: 1 of 5, males 0 of 5) and interstitial inflammation (males: 4 of 5, females 1 of 5, compared to control: males: 1 of 5, females: 2 of 5). Associated with these findings were increased kidney weights for females. For male rats of the intermediate dosage group, basophilic epithelium with occasional mitoses were also seen. Increased water consumption for rats of the high dosage group was considered to be related to the kidney effects. Liver: In the liver of high dosage group female rats, minimal centrilobular hepatocyte enlargement with associated increased liver weight. These findings were considerd to be adaptive and related to the metabolism of the test substance. The finding in the kidney at the high and intermediate dosages was considered to be an adverse effect. There were no treatment related effects on the low dosage of 15 mg/kg bw/day. Based on these findings, a LOAEL of 150 mg/kg bw/day and a NOEL of 15 mg/kg bw/day was derived. /Octylphenol/",

Adult males kept under long or short photoperiod were orally administered OP (200 mg/kg bw) for 30 or 60 days. Treatment for 30 days had no discernible effect on the parameters examined. Treatment for 60 days adversely influenced weights and histological structure of the testes and seminal vesicles. In these tissues, expression of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and androgen receptor and testosterone levels were reduced, whereas expression of aromatase and estrogen receptor a and estradiol levels were increased. The alterations were more evident in voles kept in long photoperiod. Taken together, it is suggested that adverse changes in bank vole reproductive tissues induced by long-term OP-exposure result from disturbed androgen and estrogen synthesis and action. Moreover, there might be a subtle difference in the sensitivity to OP between voles kept in different light conditions.",

It has been demonstrated that exposure of amphibians to estrogenic chemicals or UVBR can affect the timing of larval development and metamorphosis. However, amphibians in the wild are exposed to multiple environmental stressors simultaneously. Therefore, our study examines the effects of UVBR and the estrogenic chemical 4-tert-octylphenol (OP), alone and in combination, on the thyroid system of Rana pipiens tadpoles, which is the main regulator of amphibian metamorphosis. Results demonstrate that thyroid gland histomorphology measurements in Gosner stage 31 tadpoles continuously exposed to UVBR (0.21 W/m(2)) were not different than those measured in animals from the control group. In a separate experiment, tadpoles exposed to environmentally relevant levels of UVBR (0.22 W/m(2)) and/or OP (0.01nM or 10nM) exhibited significantly delayed development starting from Gosner stage 29, given that fewer tadpoles developed past stage 29 in these groups. In addition, significantly fewer UVBR-treated tadpoles developed past stage 34 and metamorphosed. Samples were collected from stages 29 and 34 tadpoles for gene expression analysis in tail tissue and measurements of T3 (triiodothyronine) whole body levels (minus tail). UVBR and/or OP exposure did not affect T3 levels in stages 29 and 34 tadpoles. However, a decrease in deiodinase type 2 (D2) or increase in deiodinase type 3 (D3) mRNA levels was observed in groups of tadpoles with slowed developmental rates at those developmental stages. Given that D2 activates and D3 inactivates thyroid hormones (TH), UVBR/OP mediated disruptions in development are likely caused by dysfunctions in the localized metabolism of THs through alterations in the expression of these enzymes in peripheral tissues. This is the first study to our knowledge reporting a potential thyroid-based mechanism of action for the developmental delays in amphibians exposed to UVBR and/or OP.",

We determined the effects of exposure to estrogenic chemicals and wastewater effluent (WWE) on developing gonads of the American bullfrog, Rana (Lithobates) catesbeiana, a species whose widespread distribution make it an ideal model for environmental monitoring of endocrine effects of chemical contaminants. Premetamorphic bullfrog tadpoles were exposed to treatment vehicle, 17beta-estradiol (E2; 10(-9)M) or 4-tert-octylphenol (OP; 10(-9)M, 10(-8)M, and 10(-7)M). Additionally, gonadal differentiation was evaluated in bullfrog tadpoles from a WWE-containing site versus those from a reference location receiving no WWE. In both studies, phenotypic sex, steroidogenic factor-1 (nr5a1), and aromatase (cyp19a1) mRNA levels using quantitative real-time PCR were determined. Exposure to E2 or OP did not alter sex ratios. In controls, both nr5a1 and cyp19a1 transcript levels exhibited sexual dimorphism, with males demonstrating higher levels of nr5a1 and females greater abundance of cyp19a1. However, E2 exposure increased cyp19a1 mRNA abundance in testes and decreased levels in ovaries, eliminating the sexual dimorphism observed in controls. E2-exposed males exhibited increased nr5a1 transcript levels in the testes compared to controls, while females demonstrated no E2 effect. OP treatment had no effect on female cyp19a1 mRNA abundance, but exposure to 10(-7)M OP increased testicular transcript levels. Treatment with 10(-9) and 10(-8)M OP, but not 10(-7)M, resulted in decreased abundance of nr5a1 transcript in both ovaries and testes. Animals from the field had sexually dimorphic gonadal levels of cyp19a1, but both sexes from the WWE site exhibited elevated cyp19a1 transcript abundance compared to the reference location. Individual chemical compounds and anthropogenic wastewater effluent dispersed within the environment influence the levels of gonadal mRNA encoding key proteins involved in gonadal differentiation.",

In teleost fishes, the hormonal regulation during a critical period of larval development has a strong influence on gonadal sex differentiation; thus this process may be affected by the exposure to environmental estrogens. In this study, we first assessed the lethal acute toxicity of the natural estrogen 17beta-estradiol (E2) and the weaker estrogen mimics 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) and 4-nonylphenol (NP) on larval stages of the South American cichlid fish Cichlasoma dimerus. In a further experiment, we analyzed the effects of chronic waterborne exposure to E2 and OP on gonad development and sex differentiation. Exposure to high concentrations of E2 had a pronounced feminizing effect directing sex differentiation towards ovarian development, while testis development was inhibited at a lower, environmentally relevant concentration. Among OP-exposed fish, 15-38.5% of the males exhibited testicular oocytes (TOs), a commonly reported biomarker of estrogenic exposure. However, since TOs were also recorded in control males and the proportion of males with TOs was not significantly higher in OP treatments, their occurrence could not be attributed to OP exposure. In addition, TOs did not seem to impair male gonad development and functionality since normal spermatogenesis was observed in testes of OP-treated fish. These results indicate that E2 occurring in the South American aquatic environment may affect male reproductive development and pose a risk for wild C. dimerus, especially under prolonged exposure, while the effects of weaker xenoestrogens such as OP would be negligible for gonad development in this species. As illustrated by this study, the natural occurrence of TOs indicates that conclusions concerning the causes of this phenomenon must be drawn with care.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.78X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 hrs. Particulate-phase p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. p-(1,1,3,3-Tetramethylbutyl)phenol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol is expected to have low  mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. p-(1,1,3,3-Tetramethylbutyl)phenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 and 61 days, respectively. BCF values of 261 and 90 suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol is produced or used.

The colloidal concentrations for 4-tert-octylphenol, 4-nonylphenol, bisphenol A (BPA), and estrone (E1) were in the ranges of 0.2 ng/L to 0.8 ng/L, 23.2 ng/L to 108 ng/L, 2.3 ng/L to 97.6 ng/L, and not detectable (nd) to 0.32 ng/L, respectively; for truly dissolved concentrations, the ranges were 0.5 ng/L to 5.4 ng/L, 39 ng/L to 319 ng/L, 13.7 ng/L to 91.2 ng/L, and nd to 1.2 ng/L, respectively. Positive correlations of EDCs with colloidal organic carbon (COC) were observed. The in situ COC normalized partitioning coefficients (log KCOC) for 4-tert-octylphenol (5.35+ or -0.42), 4-nonylphenol (5.69+ or -0.50), and BPA (5.51+ or -0.77) were within the ranges reported by other studies, whereas they were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than their particulate/truly dissolved phase partition coefficients (log math formula), revealing much strong sorption of EDCs by aquatic colloids. Moreover, colloid-bound percentages of 4-tert-octylphenol, 4-nonylphenol, and BPA ranged, respectively, from 6.9% to 36.4%, from 16.7% to 63.1%, and from 3.6% to 52.4%; their estimated mass fractions were 0.29+ or -0.21, 0.38+ or -0.26, and 0.39+ or -0.33, respectively. Obviously the colloid-bound fractions are significant. Furthermore, a medium risk of estrogenic effects was estimated from the truly dissolved concentrations of EDCs in the Pearl River, which was lower than the estimated high risk according to the conventionally dissolved concentrations.

Vapor-phase p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.2X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) (that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). p-(1,1,3,3-Tetramethylbutyl)phenol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

In experiments with a soil column, concentrations of 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol were about two orders of magnitude lower in the column effluent than in the feed(2). Soil from this column, which had undergone 3 inundation cycles with 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol at 10 ug/l, required 16 hours to convert 7% of this compound to CO2. Microbial adaptation was noted for this compound, as indicated by increased removal efficiencies during successive inundation cycles (6 day flooding, 16 day drying cycle) at varying concentrations. Column effluent concentrations of 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol were independent of input concentrations during the final stage of the test(2). Following three aerobic flooding cycles, anaerobic conditions were introduced(3). Fractional breakthrough profiles for 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol did not change (from those obtained during aerobic test conditions) although the degree of breakthrough increased for this compound; this indicates that the inhibition in compound removal mediated by anaerobic conditions is not due solely to cessation of mineralization activity(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Blood and urine samples were collected from six male volunteers following the administration of 46 mg of 2H10 labeled di-2-(ethylhexyl)adipate. Blood was collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 hours after administration. Urine was collected for up to 96 hours after administration. No adverse effects were observed in any of the volunteers and no significant changes in biochemical or hematological parameters were seen. The plasma contained no parent molecule; however, the metabolite 2-ethylhexanoic-acid was detected, but levels were below the limit of quantitation. 2-ethylhexanoic-acid, as a conjugated product, was also the principal metabolite detected in urine. Urinary elimination of the di-2-(ethylhexyl)adipate metabolites peaked within 8 hours of dosing in all volunteers; beyond 36 hours, no metabolites were detected in urine. The conjugated 2-ethylhexanoic acid in urine accounted for an average of 8.6% of the administered dose. A further 3.5% of the dose was accounted for by 2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexanoic acid, 2-ethylhexanedioic acid, 2-ethyl-5-keto-hexanoic acid, and 2-ethylhexanol. /It was/ concluded that 2-ethylhexanoic acid is an appropriate marker for biological monitoring in estimating the dietary di-2-(ethylhexyl)adipate intake as it is the major metabolite identified and as its rate of elimination is similar to that of other measured di-2-(ethylhexyl)adipate metabolites.",

Animals were sacrificed 30 min, 2 and 6 hr after the administration of 2-(14)C-ethylhexanoic acid in autoradiography experiments. The highest uptake of 2-(14)C-ethylhexanoic acid was observed in the liver, kidney and blood in mice. In contrast, low uptake of 2-(14)C-ethylhexanoic acid was seen in the brain. 2-(14)C-ethylhexanoic acid was well detectable in the olfactory bulb and in the salivary gland. In rats, at 2 hr after administration the highest concentration of 2-(14)C-ethylhexanoic acid occurred in blood (0.3%; of the total dose/g tissue). The radioactivity in the liver (0.2%) and kidney (0.1%) was also relatively high. The concentrations of 2-(14)C-ethylhexanoic acid was low in the brain (0.02%). By 6 hr, the radioactivity had decreased rapidly and was hardly measurable at 24 hr after the administration. The results suggest that 2-ethylhexanoic acid is rapidly cleared from the tissues.",

An aqueous solution of [2-14(C)-hexyl]2-ethylhexanoic acid was applied topically at either 100 or 1000 mg/kg and another group of rats received 2-ethylhexanoic acid by intravenous injection (1 mg/kg). Urine, feces, and blood were collected at various intervals for 96 hr. Approximately 72 to 75 percent of the oral dose was excreted in the urine within 24 hr, and <10 percent was excreted after 24 hr. About 50% of the 14(C) was excreted in the first 8 hr after the 100-mg/kg dose versus 20 percent after the 1000 mg/kg dose. Fecal excretion accounted for 7 to 12 percent of both doses. After intravenous injection, 64 percent of the l4(C) was excreted in the urine and 2 percent in the feces. Repeated dosing with unlabeled 2-ethylhexanoic acid (100 mg/kg) appeared to reduce the urinary elimination of 14(C) slightly to 55 percent in urine, whereas the fecal excretion increased to 15 percent in the first 24 hr. After dermal application, approximately 30 percent of the applied dose was excreted in the urine during the first 24 hr, followed by an additional 8 and 17 percent from 24 to 96 hr for the 100- and 1000-mg/kg doses, respectively. Fecal excretion was 7 percent for both dose levels. Dermal absorption was estimated to be 63 to 70 percent relative to intravenous administration. After dermal application, peak blood levels of 14C occurred about 5.7 hr after application and the absorption half-life was 3.2 hr. Major urinary metabolites included the glucuronide of 2-ethylhexanoic acid, the glucuronides of 2-ethyl-6-hydroxyhexanoic acid and 2-ethyl-1,6-hexanedioic acid, and unmetabolized 2-ethylhexanoic acid. The proportions of each metabolite changed with the dose and route of administration.",

The hypothesis that infants undergoing exchange transfusion are exposed to toxic levels of di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate and the presumed metabolite 2-ethylhexanoic acid was tested by measuring serum levels of di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate in 16 newborn infants (gas-liquid-chromatography) and urine concentrations of 2-ethylhexanoic acid in 6 of these infants (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate levels were undetectable (< 1 ug/mL) before exchange but ranged from 6.1 to 21.6 ug/mL of serum (average, 12.5 to 6.2 ug/mL) after a single exchange transfusion. Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate uptake did not result in cholestasis. 2-Ethylhexanoic acid peak levels were 127 to 416 ng per mL of urine, with a median of 174 ng per mL. Concentrations of 2-ethylhexanoic acid were lower than anticipated, which indicates that 2-ethylhexanoic acid is not a major metabolite in the neonatal infant.",

Liver microsomes were extracted from male Han/Wistar rats, male DBA/2N/Kuo mice, and humans undergoing liver surgery. 2-Ethylhexanoic acid metabolism was determined in-vitro by incubating the microsomes in the presence and absence of the cytochrome P450 inhibitors triacetyloleandomycin, metyrapone, quinidine, and SKF-525A. In-vivo, 2-ethylhexanoic acid metabolism was determined by administering 2-ethylhexanoic acid to rats with and without the cytochrome P450 inhibitors, and by assessing metabolite levels in human urine samples taken from 2-ethylhexanoic acid exposed sawmill workers. The main 2-ethylhexanoic acid metabolite produced in all microsomes was 2-ethyl-1,6-hexanedioic acid. Production of this metabolite was prevented by triacetyloleandomycin, metyrapone, quinidine, and SKF-525A. /It was/ concluded that some cytochrome P450s may contribute to 2-ethylhexanoic acid metabolism in the liver, that the same 2-ethylhexanoic acid metabolites are formed in rats and humans, and that 2-ethylhexanoic acid resembles the hepatotoxicant 2-envalproic acid.",

With three consecutive administrations one-half-day intervals, the most sensitive time to induce exencephaly was Gestational Days 8-9. Using the racemic substance it was determined that the SWV strain was more sensitive to the induction of exencephaly than the C57BL/6NCrlBR strain. The enantiomers of 2-ethylhexanoic acid were separated via preparative HPLC to greater than 99.8% optical purity, and greater than 99% purity according to a gas chromatographic analysis. It was demonstrated that the (R)-enantiomer is a more potent teratogen than the (S)-enantiomer for the induction of exencephaly as well as malformations of other organ systems. Pharmacokinetic analyses for each of the enantiomers were performed in maternal plasma, maternal muscle, and embryo. The pharmacokinetics showed that the peak concentration (Cmax) for both enantiomers in the three compartments was approximately equivalent and was attained within 15 min following the third administration. The area under the concentration versus time curve values for the two enantiomers were approximately 10 higher for the (R)-antipode because of a slightly slower elimination of this compound. There was negligible (or no) racemization of the two enantiomers in the biological samples. The results suggest that teratologic differences in the enantiomers of sodium 2-ethylhexanoate are not due to differences in the concentrations of these antipodes in the embryo, but more likely result from the specific interaction of the enantiomers with chiral molecules in the embryo.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.

They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Carboxylic acids with six or fewer carbon atoms are freely or moderately soluble in water; those with more than six carbons are slightly soluble in water. Soluble carboxylic acid dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Many insoluble carboxylic acids react rapidly with aqueous solutions containing a chemical base and dissolve as the neutralization generates a soluble salt. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Insoluble carboxylic acids react with solutions of cyanides to cause the release of gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymerization reactions; like other acids, they often catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions.",

Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) /were exposed/ to 2-Ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA) in vitro and /the authors/ measured the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and explored the associated cellular mechanisms. 2-EHA (10-2000 uM) inhibited dose-dependently formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)-induced respiratory burst in PMNL. Moreover, 2-EHA decreased oxidative burst evoked by the protein kinase C (PKC) activators, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and dioctanoyl-s,n-glycerol (DIC(8)). 2-EHA affected neither the levels of free intracellular calcium nor inhibited PKC. The results indicate that 2-EHA inhibits activation of PMNL to produce ROS, i.e. has an immunosuppressive effect in vitro. The site of action in the PKC is after activation of this enzyme.",

Four groups of 2 female Fischer 344 rats were exposed with undiluted injections of approximately 1 g/kg through an occluded containment device (2 x 2 cm exposure area) attached to shaved dorsal skin. A pair of treated rats and one of four control rats, similarly attired without treatment, were sacrificed at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-injection for gross and microscopic assessments of dermal corrosion. Gross changes associated with treatment were minimal at 96-hour final necropsy. A white powdery deposit on treated skin and one incidence of focal (2 mm diameter) erythema were observed in the 2 treated rats. Histopathological review, however, revealed a profound dermal response at 24 hours, characterized by necrosis with inflammation of underlying dermal and hypodermis indicative of a breakdown of epidermal integrity. Serial examinations revealed healing by regeneration of necrotic areas from adjacent, less damaged areas' increasing thickness at 48 hours, and a progressive reversal of epidermal thickening at 72 and 96 hours. At 48 hours, acanthosis and keratosis were apparent in most samples, as were prominent keratohyalin granules and parakeratosis. Mitotic figures gave testimony to regeneration from basal layer cells. The study authors offered the lack of residual test substance in the containment device at 24 hours with subsequent amelioration of dermal corrosion as evidence of rapid (24 hour) dermal absorption of 2-ethylhexanoic acid.",

Four groups of 2 female Fischer 344 rats were exposed with undiluted injections of approximately 1 g/kg through an occluded containment device (2 x 2 cm exposure area) attached to shaved dorsal skin. A pair of treated rats and one of four control rats, similarly attired without treatment, were sacrificed at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-injection for gross and microscopic assessments of dermal corrosion. Gross changes associated with treatment were minimal at 96-hour final necropsy. Histopathological review, however, revealed a profound dermal response at 24 hours, characterized by necrosis with inflammation of underlying dermal and hypodermis indicative of a breakdown of epidermal integrity. Serial examinations revealed healing by regeneration of necrotic areas from adjacent, less damaged areas' increasing thickness at 48 hours, and a progressive reversal of epidermal thickening at 72 and 96 hours. At 48 hours, acanthosis and keratosis were apparent in most samples, as were prominent keratohyalin granules and parakeratosis. Mitotic figures gave testimony to regeneration from basal layer cells. The study authors offered the lack of residual test substance in the containment device at 24 hours with subsequent amelioration of dermal corrosion as evidence of rapid (24 hour) dermal absorption of 2- ethylhexanoic acid.",

The presence of these metabolites is now reported in a variety of environmental samples. Thus, even in a complex ecosystem, when plasticizers are degraded, the breakdown is not complete and significant amounts of 2-ethylhexanoic acid and 2-ethylhexanol are observed. These compounds have been shown to exhibit acute toxicity using Microtox, Daphnia, rainbow trout and fathead minnow toxicity assays. Since it is already well established that plasticizers are ubiquitous in the environment, it is expected that their recalcitrant metabolites will also be ubiquitous. This is of concern because, while the plasticizers do not exhibit acute toxicity, their metabolites do.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.03 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates 2-ethylhexanoic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-ethylhexanoic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Particulate-phase 2-ethylhexanoic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2-Ethylhexanoic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-ethylhexanoic acid is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 650. The estimated pKa of 2-ethylhexanoic acid is 4.70, indicating that this compound will partially exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. A biodegradation half-life of approximately 5 days when incubated in river sediment suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be a slow fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, 2-ethylhexanoic acid is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be a slow fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 and 120 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-ethylhexanoic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-ethylhexanoic acid is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-ethylhexanoic acid via ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other consumer products containing 2-ethylhexanoic acid.

Volatilization of 2-ethylhexanoic acid from moist soil surfaces is expected to be a slow fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.03 mm Hg(6), and water solubility, 2,000 mg/L(7). 2-Ethylhexanoic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(6).

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.03 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 2,000 mg/L(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 and 120 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A biodegradation half-life of approximately 5 days when incubated in river sediment(9) suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 2-ethylhexanoic acid is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 15 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 120 days(SRC). 2-Ethylhexanoic acid's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 2-Ethylhexanoic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

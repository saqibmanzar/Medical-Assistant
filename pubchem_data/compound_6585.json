The measured flash point (closed cup) for 5, 15 and 35% PAA was 74-83, 68-81 and 46-62 \u00b0C, respectively. For 15 % PAA the open cup flash point was > 100 \u00b0C.  This scatter may be attributed to several factors e.g., PAA reacting with the sample container used in the flash point determination, thermal instability of the PAA solutions, loss of volatile material during analysis due to decomposition and excessive gassing, releasing oxygen and water which tend to extinguish any flame. While the reported flash point value may not be exact, it is an indication of the temperature at which vapours can ignite. Most of the PAA equilibrium grades ranging from 5% to 15% exhibit closed-cup flash points but no measurable open-cup flash points.",

Whether PAA sterilization would influence recellularization, restoration of crimp length and pattern, and revascularization of ACL grafts during early healing /was examined using/an in vivo sheep model for open ACL reconstruction ... The histologic findings /were correlated/ with the restoration of anteroposterior stability and structural properties during load-to-failure testing. PAA slowed remodeling activity at 6 and 12 weeks compared to nonsterilized allografts and autografts. The mechanical properties of PAA grafts were also reduced compared to these control groups at both time points. /It was concluded that/  PAA sterilization currently should not be used to sterilize soft tissue grafts typically used in ACL reconstruction.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Incubation of erythrocytes with 50 mM ethanol or 3 mM acetaldehyde had no effect on arachidonate incorporation. Pretreatment of erythrocytes with 10 mM hydrogen peroxide, 0.1 mM cumene hydroperoxide or 0.1 mM t-butyl hydroperoxide had little effect on 14(C)arachidonate incorporation in the absence of azide. However, pretreatment of cells with N-ethylmaleimide, 0.1 mM peracetic acid or performic acid, with or without azide, inhibited arachidonate incorporation into phospholipids but not neutral lipids. In chase experiments, peracetate also inhibited transfer of arachidonate from neutral lipids to phospholipids. To investigate a possible site of this inhibition of arachidonate transfer into phospholipids by percarboxylic acids, a repair enzyme, arachidonoyl CoA: 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine acyl transferase was assayed. As in intact cells, phospholipid biosynthesis was inhibited more by N-ethylmalemide and peracetic acid than by hydrogen peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and t-butyl hydroperoxide. Peracetic acid was the only active inhibitor among ethanol and its oxidized products studied and may deserve further examination in ethanol toxicity.",

Adding an acid or increasing the temperature during the manufacturing process can accelerate the establishment of the final equilibrium concentration (grade). Commercial grades are available in peracetic acid concentrations ranging from about 0.3 to 40 % by weight.  Solutions with a relatively low content of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide can be produced by distillation of the equilibrium solutions. In this way distilled peracetic acid is obtained.  Based on the manufacturing process, which is presented above, it is evident that pure peracetic acid is not produced/isolated when solutions of peracetic acid are manufactured.  Peracetic acid is also generated in situ when products, containing an activator (e.g. tetra-acetyl ethylenediamine, TAED) and a persalt (sodium perborate or sodium percarbonate), are dissolved in water.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Unfortunately, one of our advisees was seriously injured. The accident\u2014a reaction mixture detonation\u2014occurred during an attempt to synthesize 2-(tert-butylsulfonyl)iodosylbenzene, a partially soluble form of iodosylbenzene that is particularly convenient for use as an oxygen source in studies of catalytic chemical oxidations, such as olefin to epoxide reactions. The synthesis had been performed about a dozen times previously at Northwestern without incident.  The synthesis procedure was a modified version of a procedure first described by Dainius Macikenas and coworkers (J. Am. Chem. Soc., DOI: 10.1021/ja991094j), which in turn had been adapted from a tested \u201cOrganic Syntheses\u201d preparation (Sharefkin, J. G. and H. Saltzman, in \u201cOrganic Syntheses\u201d; H. C. Baumgarten, Ed.; New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1973; Collection Vol. 5, page 660). One modification was the use of a higher H2O2/iodobenzene ratio (25 instead of 2.8) while maintaining a similar H2O2 concentration. Likely more relevant was a second modification: the use of 35% by weight (freshly opened) hydrogen peroxide, rather than the 30 wt % solution indicated in the Macikenas procedure and used previously at Northwestern.  We do not know with any certainty what caused the explosion. However, the procedure entails combining aqueous H2O2 with acetic anhydride to form peracetic acid. The water component of the aqueous H2O2 solution should serve to remove excess acetic anhydride. We speculate that if some acetic anhydride remained after conversion of the majority to peracetic acid (the desired intermediate compound) or acetic acid (side product), the anhydride could have combined with peracetic acid to form diacetyl peroxide. This organic peroxide is known to be a shock-sensitive explosive.  If our reasoning is correct, the amount of diacetyl peroxide that potentially can form is greater in the modified reaction. Presumably, the less water initially present the greater the chance of forming the unstable organic peroxide. For a given amount of H2O2, the number of moles of water present in 35 wt % hydrogen peroxide is about 21% less than the number present in 30 wt % hydrogen peroxide. It is sobering to realize that even with 35 wt % hydrogen peroxide, the combined number of moles of water and hydrogen peroxide likely exceeded the number of moles of acetic anhydride initially present\u2014and yet an explosion occurred. It is unclear what the margin of error is with regard to water and hydrogen peroxide concentration versus acetic anhydride concentration. However, we believe that at least some diacetyl peroxide is formed under all reaction conditions.  We emphasize that the above \u201cexplanation\u201d and discussion are speculative. Nevertheless, there is support from the patent literature. (See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,079,443, \u201cProduction of a Solution of Diacetyl Peroxide in Acetic Anhydride.\u201d) In the patented process the coreactant is aqueous H2O2.  At least until the cause of the explosion can be determined, we strongly encourage researchers to consider using alternative, nonperoxide, routes to 2-(t-butylsulfonyl)iodosylbenzene, iodobenzene diacetate, and related compounds (J.\u202fAm. Chem. Soc., DOI: 10.1021/ja1069773). More generally, we recommend that aqueous H2O2 and acetic anhydride never be combined\u2014despite the fact that, until now, this has been a commonly used reagent combination in oxidation chemistry.\" (reprint of full text)",

The concentration of peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid can reach levels of about 40, 30 and 40 %, respectively, in certain equilibrium solutions. Nearly all toxicity studies, related with human health and environment, were done with equilibrium solutions. PAA is also commercialized as a distilled product containing primarily peracetic acid and water. Distilled PAA solutions are unstable under ambient conditions and re-equilibrate under formation of hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid. By cooling below 0 \u00b0C the hydrolysis reaction is slowed down. The amount of peracetic acid in these aqueous solutions ranges from about 0.15 to 40 %. ...  Human Health:  An in vitro dermal penetration assay at 37 \u00b0C using 0.8 % PAA (non corrosive) indicated a low dermal uptake of peracetic acid through the intact skin of pigs. When the skin of rats was exposed to a corrosive concentration of (14)C-labelled PAA a considerable uptake of (14)C was found but it is unknown if the (14)C was present as peracetic acid, acetic acid or CO2. It is expected that corrosive concentrations of PAA would compromise the normal barrier function of the skin.  Two reliable in vitro studies, using different analytical methods, showed a rapid degradation of peracetic acid in rat blood. When rat blood was diluted 1000 times, the half-life of peracetic acid was < 5 minutes. In undiluted blood the half-life is expected to be several seconds or less. For this reason the distribution of peracetic acid is probably very limited and it is not expected to be systemically available after exposure to peracetic acid solutions. Degradation products have not been identified during the kinetic studies. However, based on the structure of the substance the following degradation products are expected: acetic acid, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and water. Hydrogen peroxide is also presumed to be rapidly degraded into oxygen and water.  The results of acute toxicity tests are expressed on the component peracetic acid, which was calculated based on the composition of the product used for the acute tests. The available acute inhalation studies with aerosols and vapour revealed an 4 hr-LC50 ranging from 76 to >241 mg/cu m. The acute dermal toxicity of PAA solutions was tested in rats and rabbits. No sign of dermal toxicity was observed when rats were exposed to solutions of 0.15-15%, while LD50 values of 56.1 and 228.8 mg PAA/kg bw were reported for rabbits for concentrations of 4.9 and 11.7 % PAA, respectively. The dermal toxicity depends on the degree of skin damage caused by the different PAA solutions, since the corrosive properties of PAA solutions may compromise the integrity of the skin. In oral toxicity studies LD50 values ranged between 9.0 and 202.8 mg/kg bw based on the component peracetic acid. sporadic contact with even dilute solutions with the oesophagus could lead to deaths due to corrosion of the tissue and could explain the variability in the LD50.  The pathology and symptoms were similar across all studies, indicating irritation and corrosion of tissues in contact with the test material.  PAA solutions should be considered as corrosive (within 3 minutes) at concentrations of 10 % and higher when applied to the skin of rabbits. PAA was generally corrosive to rabbit skin at a concentration of 5 % if contact lasted 45 minutes or longer. Concentrations of less than 0.34 % PAA were only slight irritants or non-irritants, depending on the exposure duration of the skin. PAA was corrosive at concentrations of 0.34 % and higher when tested in the rabbit eye. Slight or no eye irritation was found at concentrations of 0.15 % or less PAA. Incidental human findings on skin and eye irritation are supporting the animal studies.  Peracetic acid gave a positive response in Alarie assay in the mouse, with an RD50 value (concentration producing a 50 % decrease in the respiratory rate) of 12 and 17 mg/m3 (peracetic acid in vapour mixture from the formulation and peracetic acid only). Human data support the sensory irritating properties of peracetic acid.  No skin sensitisation was observed in three Buhler tests in guinea pigs with different formulations of PAA. The exposure concentration of peracetic acid ranged from 0.15 to 1.2 % during the tests. Additionally, long term experience with production and use of PAA has shown that PAA has no sensitisation potential.  To investigate the repeated dose toxicity, a GLP guideline study was done with rats, which were exposed by gavage for 13 weeks to 5 % PAA diluted to various concentrations (0.018 % to 0.55 % of the component peracetic acid). At 0.75 mg/kg/day transient or intermittent loud breathing was observed in two females but the effect was not considered adverse. Based on the results of this study the NOAEL was 0.75 mg/kg bw/day (component peracetic acid). The only observed effects were local effects that are concentration related. It is therefore reasonable to define a No Observed Adverse Effect Concentration rather than a classical NOAEL. Based on the component peracetic acid, the NOAEC for local effects was 0.055 %.  Gene mutation assays in bacteria tests, with and without metabolic activation, showed negative results. Two DNA repair tests in human foetal lung cells did not indicate a genotoxic potential of PAA. In the in vitro chromosome aberration test, positive findings were obtained only at cytotoxic concentrations. Under in vivo conditions, PAA (4.5 and 5.17% product) did not produce micronuclei in two mouse micronucleus tests after oral administration. In two in vivo/ex vivo assays of unscheduled DNA synthesis in rats after oral administration, PAA did not show significant genotoxicity potential. Overall these data do not raise concern with regard to the mutagenic and genotoxic potential of PAA However, peracetic acid is not systemically available and this could explain the lack of in vivo mutagenicity, but site of contact effects cannot be excluded completely. No valid carcinogenicity study with PAA is available.  No valid data on fertility are available. However, in a well documented GLP and guideline study aqueous dilutions of 5 % PAA were administered daily by gavage to Sprague-Dawley rats for 13 weeks. No effects of peracetic acid on the reproductive organs of both sexes following macroscopic post mortem examinations and microscopic examinations (histopathology) were notable during the study. Because peracetic acid is rapidly degraded in blood, distribution to reproductive organs is not anticipated, and therefore it is unlikely to be a reproductive toxicant. In addition, the degradation product hydrogen peroxide did not indicate any effect in the reproductive organs during a 90-day drinking water study and furthermore, a rapid degradation was presumed resulting in a lack of systemic availability In a well documented GLP and guideline developmental toxicity study performed with 32-38 % PAA, pregnant Wistar rats were administered dose levels of 100, 300 or 700 mg peracetic acid/l (corresponding to 12.5, 30.4 and 48.1 mg peracetic acid/kg bw/day) via the drinking water from day 5 to 20 of gestation. No teratogenic effect was evident up to and including the high dose level of 700 mg peracetic acid/l (48.1 mg peracetic acid/kg bw/day). Dose and treatment-related maternal toxicity was observed, considering water and food consumption, above 100 mg/L (12.5 mg PAA/kg bw). At 700 mg peracetic acid/L (48.1 mg/kg bw) this resulted in severe reductions in drinking water and food consumption and in absolute body weight as well as by a drastic reduction in overall body weight gain and in body weight gain corrected for uterine weight. At the high dose level, fetal weight was statistically significantly reduced (5 %) but litter size at this dose level was about 13 % higher than in controls. However, it is doubtful if the reduction of 5% is biologically relevant The overall NOAEL for foetal toxicity is therefore 300 mg/L (30.4 mg PAA/kg bw) based on a statistically significantly lower body weight and an increased incidence of poor and/or hypertrophic ossification (bone formation) in the presence of severe maternal effects (maternal NOAEL = 100 mg/L or 12.5 mg PAA/kg bw/day). Environment  Peracetic acid is an organic substance which is completely miscible with water (water solubility of 1000 g/l at 20 \u00b0C) and which displays oxidising properties. Pure peracetic acid is not available because it is explosive. For this reason it is technically not possible to perform an experimental study according to the guidelines to determine the melting point, boiling point and vapor pressure of pure peracetic acid. Based on modelling, the melting point, boiling point and vapour pressure were estimated to be -42 \u00b0C, about 105 \u00b0C and 32 hPa (at 25 \u00b0C), respectively. The log Pow was reported to be -0.52 (measured value) and the Henry Law's constant is 0.22 Pa cu m/mol. The pKa of peracetic acid is 8.2 at 20 \u00b0C and therefore the substance is mainly present in the environment as peracetic acid at a neutral pH (pH = 7), while peracetate would mainly be present if the pH is significantly higher than 8.2.  Based on the high water solubility, low vapour pressure and low octanol-water partition coefficient, peracetic acid is expected to partition almost exclusively to the aquatic compartment (99.95 %). In air the half-life of peracetic acid is 22 minutes. The abiotic degradation of peracetic acid increases with temperature and pH. At a temperature of 25 \u00b0C and at pH of 4, 7 and 9, the degradation half-life value were 48, 48 and < 3.6 hours respectively. Peracetic acid was readily biodegradable during a biodegradation test when an inhibition of the micro-organisms (biocidal effect) was prevented. Peracetic acid will be degraded in a sewage treatment plant if the influent concentration is not extremely high (eg > 100 ppm). If effluents generated during the production or use of PAA are treated by a waste water treatment plant, no emission of peracetic acid to the aquatic environment is expected.  Several studies on acute toxicity to aquatic species are available for all trophic levels. The pH of the test solutions was not adapted during the studies because a decrease of the pH was not found. In most cases the endpoints of the aquatic toxicity tests were based on nominal concentrations. The 96-hr LC50 values for fish ranged between 0.9 and 3.3 mg/l in most freshwater species. The 48-hr EC50 for D. magna ranged between 0.5 and 1.0 mg/L. Based on the representative standard toxicity tests, the lowest 72-hr NOEC of 0.084 mg/L was found for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (formerly known as Selenastrum capricornutum). The lowest EC50 value of 0.18 mg/L was found during a 120-hr growth inhibition test with P. subcapitata. . To determine the toxicity for microorganisms, two respiration inhibition tests with activated sludge of predominantly domestic sewage treatment plants were conducted. The EC50 after 3 hours was 5.1 and 38.6 mg peracetic acid/l (based on nominal concentrations), respectively. In general, the aquatic tests with fish, invertebrates and algae were reproducible if concentrations were expressed as peracetic acid irrespective of the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid. Thus, the peracetic acid concentration alone may explain the toxicity of PAA formulations. Exposure  The global number of production sites is estimated to be 40-100 and the majority of the production sites are located in Europe.  The equilibrium peracetic acid consumption (as such) in 2004 was estimated to be: - 40,000 - 80,000 tonnes in Europe - less than 20,000 tonnes in the USA and - less than 10,000 tonnes in the rest of the world. The quantities of equilibrium peracetic acid, given above, are mainly used for disinfection. Neither use of peracetic acid for chemical synthesis nor in situ generation of peracetic acid is included.  Major uses of peracetic acid are in chemical synthesis, disinfection and bleaching. Low concentrations (1-15 %) are used as sanitisers, disinfectants and sterilants in agriculture, food, beverage and medical industries. High-strength equilibrium (> 15 %) and distilled peracetic acid products are in general employed as oxidising agents in the manufacture of organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Distilled peracetic acid is also used as bleaching agent in TCF cellulose pulp production processes replacing chlorine dioxide. Peracetic acid seems to be used in certain European countries in consumer products, which are used for example for hard surface disinfection.  Peracetic acid is also generated in situ when products, containing an activator (eg tetra-acetyl ethylenediamine, TAED) and a persalt (sodium perborate or sodium percarbonate), are dissolved in water. These products could be laundry detergents but they could also be used for surface disinfection (eg hospitals, farms). World-wide consumption in chemical synthesis including captive use (internal use by a company) and in situ generation has been estimated at 45,000-50,000 tonnes peracetic acid (100 %) in 1998.  During use of peracetic acid the substance may be released to the aquatic environment Also in situ formation may result in an exposure of the aquatic environment. However, if the effluents are treated by wastewater treatment plants no emission of peracetic acid to the aquatic environment is expected.",

This study is aimed at highlighting the ecotoxicity of a peracetic acid-based disinfectant to Daphnia magna, as well as the combined effects of this disinfectant in binary mixtures with three types of detergent. The detergents used here are: cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, cationic), sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS, anionic) and Triton X-100 (TX, non-ionic). The toxicity of the mixtures is studied as a function of five predefined ratios. ... Peracetic acid seems to be slightly toxic to Daphnia magna... the  /EC50/ ... at 24 hr is 116.6 mg/L. ... The peracetic acid-TX mixture/'s/ effects have antagonistic tendencies whereas the peracetic acid-CTAB mixture has slight synergic tendencies. The mixture containing peracetic acid and SDS is slightly antagonistic for ratios containing more than 50% peracetic acid.",

Specimens of carp were exposed in four experimental tanks supplied with a continuous water flow from Lake Trasimeno (Italy), three of them treated with constant concentration of sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide and peracetic acid, for 10 and 20 days, while the control tank was supplied with untreated lake water. Differences in biochemical parameters were observed in specimens following exposure to these disinfectants and mainly, chlorine compounds induced marked biochemical variations of carp liver, compared to those induced by peracetic acid treatment ...",

Ecotoxicologic effects of urban wastewater disinfected with sodium hypochlorite or peracetic acid were analyzed ... using Daphnia magna.

By comparing this value with peracetic acid concentrations detected in effluents from a pilot plant it is expected that treated wastewater would show acute toxic effects on aquatic organisms. Dissociation compounds (hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid) and possible by-products of peracetic acid did not seem to contribute significantly to the toxicity of sewage treated with peracetic acid.",

PAA is an active bactericide at levels above 5 mg/L. It is also active on spores, viruses, and fungi. The chronic toxicity of PAA should be neglible due to rapid transformation into hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid, themselves readily degradable to non-toxic species (H2O, CO2, O2).",

Peracetic acid is formed naturally in the environment through a series of photochemical reactions involving formaldehyde and photo-oxidant radicals. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 14.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates peracetic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase peracetic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 days. Due to its high water solubility, it can dissolve in clouds and rainwater and has been identified as a constituent of acid rain. Peracetic acid contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, peracetic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.5. The pKa of peracetic acid is 8.2, indicating that this compound will exist partially in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.14X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Peracetic acid may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A >70% of theoretical BOD using sewage inoculum over an unspecified time frame suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, peracetic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 and 112 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis half-lives of 8 hours and 50 minutes were calculated for peracetic acid at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Peracetic acid is expected to hydrolyze to acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide in water. Occupational exposure to peracetic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where peracetic acid is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to peracetic acid via ingestion of food and through dermal contact with products treated with peracetic acid. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.14X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 and 112 days, respectively(SRC). A pKa of 8.2(5) indicates peracetic acid will exist partially in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9. According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -1.07(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A >70% of theoretical BOD using sewage inoculum over an unspecified time frame(9) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Hydrolysis half-lives of 8 hours and 50 minutes were calculated for peracetic acid at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively, using a base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 230 L/mole-sec(SRC) that was estimated using a structure estimation method(10). Peracetic acid is expected to hydrolyze to acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide in water(11).",

Vapor-phase peracetic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.7X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Peracetic acid contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

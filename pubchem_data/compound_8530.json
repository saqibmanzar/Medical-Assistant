Several isomeric naphthoquinones are known, notably 1,2-naphthoquinone. 1,4-Naphthoquinone forms volatile yellow triclinic crystals and has a sharp odor similar to benzoquinone. It is almost insoluble in cold water, slightly soluble in petroleum ether, and more soluble in polar organic solvents. In alkaline solutions it produces a reddish-brown color. Vitamin K is a derivative of 1,4-naphthoquinone. It is a planar molecule with one aromatic ring fused to a quinone subunit. Naphthalene is a constituent of jet fuel, diesel fuel and cigarette smoke. It is also a byproduct of incomplete combustion and hence is an ubiquitous environmental pollutant. The typical air concentration of naphthalene in cities is about 0.18 ppb.\n",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Nineteen of 24 tumors studied showed a differential response. Three human colonic adenocarcinoma xenografts, in a short-term organ culture system, displayed the same response to 1-naphthol as primary tumors removed at surgery. 1-Naphthol, 1,2-, and 1,4-naphthoquinone were also toxic to two human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines, LoVo, and COLO 206. The selective toxicity of 1-naphthol was mediated in part through an accumulation of 1-naphthol in the tumor tissue due to an impaired conjugation by the tumor. The higher concentrations of 1-naphthol may then exert their toxicity either directly or by formation of naphthoquinones. Some indirect evidence was obtained for the possible involvement of 1,2- or 1,4-naphthoquinone in the cytotoxicity of 1-naphthol. These studies suggest that further studies are warranted of the possible use of 1-naphthol or related compounds as antitumor agents.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

All three naphthoquinones extensively depleted intracellular GSH. However, the depletion of GSH induced by 1,4-NQ and 2-Me-1,4-NQ prior to cell death was more rapid and extensive than that induced by the non-toxic 2,3-diMe-1,4-NQ. Further studies demonstrated that 2,3-diMe-1,4-NQ was cytotoxic in the presence of dicoumarol, a cmpd which also potentiates the cytotoxicity of 1,4-NQ and 2-Me-1,4-NQ. To investigate the differential cytotoxicity of these three naphthoquinones, their relative capacities to redox cycle and to bind covalently to cellular nucleophiles were assessed. Redox cycling was investigated by using rat liver microsomes where the order of potency for quinone-stimulated redox cycling was 1,4-NQ ... 2-Me-1,4-NQ ... and 2,3-diMe-1,4-NQ as indicated by non-stoichiometric amounts of NADPH oxidation and O consumption. NADPH-cytochrome p450 reductase was implicated as the enzyme primarily responsible for naphthoquinone-stimulated redox cycling. The reactivity of the naphthoquinones with GSH and, by implication, with other cellular nucleophiles was 1,4-NQ > 2-Me-1,4-NQ and much > 2,3-diMe-1,4-NQ. Overall, these studies indicate that 2,3-diMe-1,4-NQ is not cytotoxic (except in the presence of dicoumarol) and this lack of toxicity may be related either to its lesser capacity to redox cycle and/or its inability to react directly with cellular nucleophiles.",

Rat liver mitochondria were incubated with 0 to 10-3 molar (M) menadione (MQ), 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ), 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DiOMeNQ), or 2,3-dimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (DiMeNQ) for 3 minutes after which 0 or 20 uM calcium-chloride was added. Release of calcium-ion (Ca2+) was monitored for 28 minutes. The effects on the state of polarization of the mitochondrial membrane and induction of mitochondrial swelling were determined. MQ, NQ, BQ, DiOMeNQ, and DiMeNQ accumulated all of the added Ca2+, but then released it following a lag period which decreased with increasing concentration. The concentrations inducing 50% Ca2+ release were: NQ, 1.6 uM; BQ, 5.3 uM; MQ, 41.6 uM; DiOMeNQ, 89.9 uM; and DiMeNQ 232.7 uM. The release of Ca2+ was accompanied by depolarization of the membrane potential and induction of mitochondrial swelling. Rat liver mitochondria were pretreated with 0.2 millimolar potassium-cyanide, then treated with 0 to 10-3 M NQ, BQ, MQ, DiOMeNQ, or DiMeNQ. Redox recycling reactivity of the compounds was assessed by measuring the rates of cyanide insensitive oxygen consumption (CIOC). All compounds except BQ caused concentration dependent increases in CIOC. MQ, DiOMeNQ, and DiMeNQ at their EC50s for Ca2+ release induced similar rates of CIOC. BQ and NQ induced very little CIOC at their EC50s. Rat liver mitochondria were pretreated with 0 or 400 nanomolar cyclosporin-A (cycA) and then incubated with NQ, BQ, MQ, DiOMeNQ, or DiMeNQ at their EC50s for Ca2+ release. This was followed by addition of 70 uM calcium-chloride. CycA completely inhibited release of Ca2+ by NQ, MQ, DiOMeNQ, and DiMeNQ. BQ accumulated very little Ca2+ before releasing it; however, the rate of release was slowed by cycA. The authors conclude that quinones that can undergo redox recycling (DiOMeNQ, DiMeNQ, MQ, and NQ) can permeabilize mitochondrial membranes by altering regulation of cycA sensitive pores. Arylating quinones such as BQ alter mitochondrial membrane permeability by depolarizing the membrane.",

In the presence of glutathione as a reducing agent, menadione and 1,4-naphthoquinone underwent net one-electron reduction and conjugation with glutathione. At higher concentrations of glutathione, 1,4-naphthoquinone formed the semiquinones of both the monoconjugate and the diconjugate. The naphthoquinone-glutathione conjugates should redox cycle in a manner already known for the menadione conjugate. The semiquinone intermediates could be detected only under a nitrogen atmosphere and are probably the primary oxygen-reactive species responsible for the redox cycling of menadione- and naphthoquinone-glutathione conjugates.",

(14)C-1-Naphthol was metabolized by hepatocytes predominantly to its glucuronate and sulfate conjugates, but small amounts of covalently bound products were also formed. Blebbing on the surface of the hepatocytes was observed following exposure to 1-naphthol and the naphthoquinones, together with a dose-dependent decr in intracellular GSH, which preceded the onset of cytotoxicity. The toxicity of 1-naphthol and the naphthoquinones was potentiated by dicoumarol, an inhibitor of DT-diaphorase (NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase). This enhanced toxicity was accompanied by a greater amount of surface blebbing, an increased depletion of intracellular GSH, particularly in the case of 1-naphthol and 1,4-naphthoquinone, and a decreased metabolism of 1-naphthol to its conjugates with variable effects on the amount of covalently bound products formed. Apparently, the toxicity of 1-naphthol may be mediated by the formation of 1,2-naphthoquinone and/or 1,4-naphthoquinone, which may then be metabolized by 1-electron reduction to naphthoquinone radicals. These, in turn, may covalently bind to important cellular macromolecules or enter a redox cycle with molecular oxygen thereby generating active oxygen species. Both of these processes appear to play a role in producing the cytotoxic effects of 1-naphthol.",

Hepatocytes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley-rats and exposed to vapor from 7.5, 10, and 15 uL of CCl4. Only those exposed to the highest level demonstrated a marked loss of viability (70%) and lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage (35%). The addition of taurine showed a dose related protection against cytotoxicity measured as leakage of LDH after 45 minutes. Cells exposed to 1,4-naphthoquinone demonstrated a dose related decrease in hepatocyte viability, a corresponding increase in LDH leakage, and a decrease in ATP after 180 minutes of incubation. Taurine caused an attenuation of the cytotoxicity with the dose response relationship being shifted to the right with a statistically significant difference in viability, LDH leakage, and ATP depletion compared to 1,4-naphthoquinone alone at an exposure level of 100 umol. Hepatocytes incubated with various concentrations of hydrazine demonstrated a dose dependent loss of cell viability and an increase in leakage of LDH. Taurine (15 mM) significantly reduced this trypan-blue uptake and LDH leakage after exposure to 20 mM and 24 mM hydrazine. Taurine had no effect on depletion of ATP at any hydrazine concentration. The authors conclude that taurine is able to protect hepatocytes against cytotoxicity caused by different compounds.",

                                                    "String": "Possible antimutagenic activity of 26 vitamins and related compounds - ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, cyanocobalamin, folic acid, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, pantothenic acid, pyridoxale, pyridoxamine, pyridoxine, retinal, retinol, retinoic acid, retinyl acetate, retinyl palmitate, riboflavin, riboflavin 5'-phosphate, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), alpha-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol acetate, vitamins K(1), K(3), K(4), 1,4-naphthoquinone, and coenzyme Q(10) - was tested against six heterocyclic amine (HCA) mutagens, i.e., 2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4, 5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethyl-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethyl-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-6-methyl-dipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) in the Salmonella/reversion assay using tester strains Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. Retinol, retinal, riboflavin, riboflavin 5'-phosphate, FAD, vitamins K(1), K(3), K(4), 1,4-naphthoquinone, and coenzyme Q(10) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the mutagenicity of all six mutagens in both tester strains. Quantification of antimutagenic potencies by calculating ID(50)1000; vitamin K(1): 401-740; vitamin K(3) (menadione): 85-590; vitamin K(4): 45-313; 1,4-naphthoquinone: 170-290; coenzyme Q(10): 490-860. In general, there were no major differences between HCAs tested except in part with Trp-P-2 nor between the two tester strains. In enzyme kinetic experiments with Salmonella, retinol, vitamins K(3), and K(4) behaved as competitive inhibitors of IQ induced mutagenesis. However, at the highest concentration of menadione (200 nmol/plate) and of riboflavin 5'-phosphate (2000 nmol/plate), non-competitive inhibition was observed. At other concentrations of riboflavin 5'-phosphate and at all concentrations of FAD, meaningful interpretation of enzyme kinetics were not possible. Reduction of the activity of 7-ethoxy- and 7-methoxyresorufin-O-dealkylases with IC(50) values of 2.03-30.8 uM indicated strong inhibition of 1A1 and 1A2 dependent monooxygenases by menadione and retinol. Riboflavin 5'-phosphate and FAD were less effective (IC(50): 110-803.7 uM). Nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotidephosphate (NADPH) cytochrome P-450 reductase was not affected by retinoids but stimulated by naphthoquinones and both riboflavin derivatives up to about 50 and 80%, respectively. Again, the mutagenic activity of N-hydroxy-2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (N-OH-IQ) in Salmonella was not suppressed by K-vitamins but marginally reduced by retinol, retinal, and FAD but distinctly by riboflavin 5'-phosphate. In various experiments designed for modulation of the mutagenic response, inhibition of metabolic activation of IQ to N-OH-IQ was found to be the only relevant mechanism of antimutagenesis of menadione while a weak contribution of an other way seemed possible for retinol and FAD.",

Animals were exposed to 50 or 100 mg/kg NA, 100 mg/kg synthesized 1,4-dihydroxynaphthalene (NHQS), or 5 mg/kg 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ) and killed after 24 hours. Liver perfusion experiments using carbon-14 labeled NA were performed, and determinations of the half life of naphthalene-oxide (NO) in spiked mouse blood, liver perfusate, and NA exposed animals were made. Alkaline permethylation was used to identify sulfhydryl adducts. The half lives of NO in whole blood or plasma was estimated to be 10 minutes. Quantification of NO levels revealed either nondetectable or highly variable levels over time for in-vivo and in-vitro conditions. Exposure to NA resulted in predominantly NQ derived adducts in liver, lung, kidney, red blood cells, and brain. Only the plasma preferentially bound NO at both doses. The percent of sulfhydryl binding was less than 1% when compared with total covalent binding as determined by retention of radioactively labeled adducts in tissues. Mice treated with NHQS showed NQ binding in the lung (target organ) and liver (nontarget organ), and more significantly in kidney (nontarget, nonmetabolizing organ). Mice exposed to NQ had extensive visible gross damage to liver, kidney, and lung. The study indicated that the half life of NO was stabilized by plasma proteins, increasing the chance of transport from a nontarget to target site. The authors conclude that NQ is delivered to tissues via circulation of a stabilized sulfate hydroquinone conjugate.",

It is released to the environment in atmospheric particulate emissions from the combustion wood, in fly ash from the incinerator combustion of municipal waste and in tailpipe emissions from diesel and gasoline engines. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.69X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,4-naphthoquinone will exist primarily as a vapor in the atmosphere; however, monitoring studies have detected it in particulate samples collected from urban air. Vapor-phase 1,4-naphthoquinone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 5 days. In addition, vapor-phase 1,4-naphthoquinone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 6.5 days. 1,4-Naphthoquinone absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Particulate-phase 1,4-naphthoquinone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. If released to soil, 1,4-naphthoquinone is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 16. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.97X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. 1,4-Naphthoquinone (at 500 mg/kg soil) required 9 days for complete biodegradation in chernozem soil and (at 1000 mg/kg soil) was 80% degraded within 22 days in a chernozem soil; it had a half-life of 1.2 days in soil in another study. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 0.6 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,4-naphthoquinone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,4-naphthoquinone is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,4-naphthoquinone via inhalation of ambient air due to the release of this substance from combustion of fuels, wood, and municipal waste.

However, monitoring data have detected 1,4-naphthoquinone adsorbed to atmospheric particulate matter collected from urban air samples(3,4), waste incinerator fly ash(5), tailpipes of diesel and gasoline engines(6) and emissions from wood combustion(7,8). Vapor-phase 1,4-naphthoquinone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 5 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.1X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(9). Vapor-phase 1,4-naphthoquinone is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 6.5 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.75E-18 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(10). 1,4-Naphthoquinone absorbs at wavelengths between 290 and 520 nm(11) and therefore is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Particulate-phase 1,4-naphthoquinone may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

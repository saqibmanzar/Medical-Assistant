They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Mites treated with propargite were kept in holding vials and the extent of metabolism was evaluated after 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr. Internal levels of radiocarbon ranged from 14.8 to 17.4% of the dose and were divided about equally between the mite extrat and mite residue fractions. Levels of propargite in the internal extract decreased from 5.9 at 6 hr to 2.5 at 48 hr when expressed as percentage of total recovered radiocarbon and from 61.5 at 6 hr to 29.8 at 48 hr when expressed as relative percentage of radiocarbon in the internal extract. Thus, propargite was degraded slowly by the mites. The metabolites 4-tert-butylphenol and 2-(4-tert-butylphenoxy) cyclohexanol (glycol ether) were present at low levels (< 0.5%). Propargite was degraded in vitro by bulb mite homogenates with the 12,000 pernatant being about four times more active than the corresponding pellet. Exogenous NADPH and glutathione greatly enhanced propargite degradation by the supernatant fraction. However, not all of the degradation in the presence of glutathione was enzymatic; about 15% of the propargite was converted to 4-tert-butylphenol when the acaricide was incubated with cofactor in buffer in the absence of the mite supernatant. In vitro propargite degradation products consisted mainly of unindentified polar metabolites, but low levels of 4-tert-butylphenol and glyol ether also were present.",

Population-based childhood cancer incidence rates throughout California /were analyzed/ in relation to agricultural pesticide use. During 1988-1994, a total of 7,143 cases of invasive cancer were diagnosed among children under 15 years of age in California. Building on the availability of high-quality population-based cancer incidence information from the California Cancer Registry, population data from the U.S. Census, and uniquely comprehensive agricultural pesticide use information from California's Department of Pesticide Regulation, /the authors/ used a geographic information system to assign summary population, exposure, and outcome attributes at the block group level. /They/ used Poisson regression to estimate rate ratios (RRs) by pesticide use density adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, and sex for all types of childhood cancer combined and separately for the leukemias and central nervous system cancers. ...Generally ... no association /was found/ between pesticide use density and childhood cancer incidence rates. The RR for all cancers was 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80-1.13] for block groups in the 90th percentile and above for use of pesticides classified as probable carcinogens, compared to the block groups with use of < 1 lb/sq mi. The RRs were similar for leukemia and central nervous system cancers. Childhood leukemia rates were significantly elevated (RR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.03-2.13) in block groups with the highest use of propargite, although ... no dose-response trend with increasing exposure categories /was seen/. Results were unchanged by further adjustment for socioeconomic status and urbanization."

Meta-analyses, ecological, case-control, and cohort studies suggest that some aspects of the agricultural environment may be implicated in the elevated risk. Hispanic farm workers in California are exposed to a multitude of potentially toxic substances in the work site, including excessive sunlight, fertilizers, diesel fumes, and pesticides. A previous analysis of a cohort of California farm workers who had been members of a farm labor union, the United Farm Workers of America (UFW) found a proportionate cancer incidence ratio for stomach cancer of 1.69 when using the California Hispanic population as the standard. The aim of the current study was to further evaluate associations between gastric cancer and the types of crops and commodities UFW members cultivate and the associated pesticide use as recorded by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR). /The authors/ conducted a nested case-control study of gastric cancer embedded in the UFW cohort and identified 100 cases of newly diagnosed gastric cancer between 1988 and 2003. /They/ identified 210 control participants matched on age, gender, ethnicity, and who were known to be alive and resident in California up to the date of the cases' diagnosis. Both stratified analyses and unconditional logistic regression were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Work in the citrus industry was associated with increased gastric cancer (OR=2.88; 95% CI=1.02-8.12) although no other specific crops or commodities were associated with this disease. Working in areas with high use of the phenoxyacetic acid herbicide 2,4-D was associated with gastric cancer (OR=1.85; 95% CI=1.05-3.25); use of the organochlorine insecticide chlordane was also associated with the disease (OR=2.96; 95% CI=1.48-5.94). Gastric cancer was associated with use of the acaricide propargite and the herbicide triflurin (OR=2.86; 95% CI=1.56-5.23 and 1.69, 95% CI=0.99-2.89, respectively). Gastric cancer in California Hispanic farm workers is associated with work in the citrus fruit industry and among those who work in fields treated with 2,4-D, chlordane, propargite, and trifluin...",

The four sources of information are OPP's Incident Data System (IDS), American Association of Poison Control Centers (PCC), California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR), and the National Pesticides Telecommunication Network CDPR and OPP data tend to provide the most insight into propargite's association with human health incidents. ... The incident data contain cases showing propargite poses skin illness and eye irritation concerns for handlers and post-application workers. From CDPR data, field residue exposure was associated with the majority (66%) of the exposure cases in California. A large proportion of cases resulted from field reentry and worker activities involving extensive contact with treated foliage such as turning cane for grapes and harvesting citrus. Applicators and other handlers accounted for the bulk of the balance (28%). These data illustrate that human incidents have historically occurred mostly among workers and handlers. Propargite usually effects the skin in human exposure cases. Of the confirmed propargite cases reported to the CDPR between 1982 and 1996, 79% of the individuals developed skin illnesses as a result of exposure (528 of 671 persons). Data covering the years 1982-1989 found that propargite was the leading cause of skin-related injuries among all pesticides in California. For the years 1990-1994, propargite dropped to seventh place among pesticides. The drop in the frequency of illnesses in the early 1990's is apparently attributable to increasing restricted entry intervals (REI), which were put into place in 1989. Depending on the crop, REIs were extended from 2-7 days to 14-42 days....",

A dose-response association with dermatitis was suggested for Omite-CR (Propargite) exposure, but not for Carzol, Omite-CR + Carzol, or other pesticides.

A control group of 15 males and 15 females was used and received no treatment. Clinical examination including hematological and blood chemistry examinations disclosed no abnormalities. Growth was retarded at the 100 mg/kg/day group and to a greater extent in the 200 mg/kg/day group. Marked reduction in absolute organ weights in the 200 mg/kg/day group was observed. Gross microscopic examination of liver, kidneys, adrenal, and gonads of the rats disclosed no significant abnormalities in any of the treated groups.  The LEL for systemic toxicity is 100 mg/kg/day based on retarded growth. Therefore, the NOEL for systemic toxicity is 40 mg/kg/day ...",

The information may include data from toxicity tests performed on aquatic and/or terrestrial organisms, where available (e.g., acute or chronic aquatic toxicity data for fish, algae, and crustaceans; toxicity data on birds, bees, and plants).  This section also includes information on whether there is a potential for the chemical to persist or degrade in the environment either through biodegradation or other processes (such as oxidation or hydrolysis) as well as the concentration or amount of the chemical found in the environment (e.g., in plants, animals as well as in the atmosphere or water).",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propargite will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase propargite will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6 hours. Propargite also reacts with ozone molecules; however, the rate of this reaction is very slow (half-life 382 days). Direct photolysis in the atmosphere is also likely to occur since propargite absorbs light greater than 290 nm and undergoes photolysis in aqueous solutions exposed to sunlight. Particulate-phase propargite will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, propargite is expected to have slight to no mobility based upon Koc values in the range of 2,963-57,966. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected based upon the vapor pressure of propargite. The time for 50% dissipation (DT50) of propargite in soil samples (pH 6-6.9, 1.0-2.55% organic carbon) under aerobic conditions was reported as 50-67 days. If released into water, propargite is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the range of Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 4,890 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. The DT50 of propargite in a sediment/water system ranged from 18.3-22.5 days. The hydrolysis half-life of propargite at pH 5, 7, and 9 is 120 days, 75 days, and 2.2 days, respectively. The aqueous photolysis DT50 in pH 5 solution was 6 days. Occupational exposure to propargite may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propargite is produced or used. Exposure to the general public may occur through inhalation, ingestion of drinking water derived from contaminated groundwater, or from consumption of food containing propargite. (SRC)",

According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF value of 4890 from a log Kow of 5.7(4) and regression derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). The hydrolysis half-life of propargite at pH 5, 7, and 9 is 120 days, 75 days, and 2.2 days, respectively(2). The time for 50% dissipation(DT50) of propargite in an aqueous photolysis experiment was 6 days and the biodegradation DT50 was 18.3-22.5 days in a sediment/water system(4).",

Vapor-phase propargite is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone molecules(SRC). The half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6 hours for hydroxyl radicals and 382 days for ozone(SRC), calculated from their respective rate constants of 6.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec and 3X10-20 cu cm/molecule-sec at and 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that were derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

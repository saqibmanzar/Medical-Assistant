They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of premixed N(2)O and oxygen in patients with out-of-hospital moderate traumatic acute pain. This prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind trial enrolled patients with acute moderate pain (numeric rating scale [NRS] score between 4 and 6 out of 10) caused by trauma. Patients were assigned to receive either 50/50 N(2)O and oxygen 9 L/min (N(2)O group) or medical air (MA) 9 L/min (MA group), in ambulances from two nurse-staffed fire department centers. After the first 15 minutes, every patient received N(2)O and oxygen. The primary endpoint was pain relief at 15 minutes (T15), defined as a NRS </= 3 of 10. The NRS was measured every 5 minutes. Secondary endpoints were treatment safety and adverse events, time to analgesia, and patient and investigator satisfaction with analgesia. Sixty patients were included with no differences between groups in age (median = 34 years, interquartile range [IQR] = 23 to 53 years), sex (37 males, 66%), and initial median NRS of 6 (IQR = 5 to 6). At T15, 67% of the patients in the N(2) O group had an NRS score of 3 or lower versus 27% of those in the MA group (delta = 40%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 17% to 63%; p < 0.001). The median pain scores were lower in the N(2)O group at T15, 2 (IQR = 1 to 4) versus 5 (IQR = 3 to 6). There was a difference at 5 minutes that persisted at all subsequent time points. Four patients (one in the N(2)O group) experienced adverse events (nausea) during the protocol. This study demonstrates the efficacy of N(2)O for the treatment of pain from acute trauma in adults in the prehospital setting.",

The study included thirty child patients who underwent general anesthesia for different reasons, with the exception of ENT problems and ear interventions. They were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 (15 children: 10 male and 5 female) received a N2O-O2 mixture (Inspired O2 30%); and group 2 (15 children: 10 male and 5 female) were given an air-oxygen mixture (Inspired O2 50%). MEP was measured using a portable impedance analyzer before the operation (PreO),10 minutes after intubation (10AEn), 30 minutes after intubation (30AEn), 10 minutes before extubation (10BEx), 15 minutes after the operation (PO15), 30 minutes after the operation (PO30), 1 hour after the operation (PO1h) and 6 hours after the operation (PO6h). The pressure and compliance values were the same in groups 1 and 2. The pressure-time graphs for the two groups were different: in Group 2, MEP rose quickly at 10AEn and positive pressure values were seen in the middle ear. MEP then fell rapidly until the end of the surgery and lower and negative pressures (Mean -50 daPa) were observed at PO6h. In Group 1, MEP was elevated at 10AEn and positive pressure was found (but not as high as in Group 2). MEP then fell more slowly. In other words, positive pressure in the middle ear persisted longer and the middle ear was subjected to positive pressure and nitrogen over a longer period. Separate analyses were made in Groups 1 and 2 of pressure differences and of compliance values at eight measurement points using the Friedman test. Differences in pressure values were found to be statistically significant in both Group 1 ... and Group 2 ... . In Group 1, all the 10AEn and 30AEn values were significantly higher than the PreO, PO30, PO1h and PO6h values. The 10BEx value was significantly higher than the PreO and PO1h values. The PO15 value was significantly higher than the PreO value. In Group 2, the PO6h value was significantly lower than the 10BEx, 10AEn and 30AEn values. The PO1h value was significantly lower than the 30AEn values. The MEP values increased in Group 1 in younger and taller children and in children receiving anesthesia for shorter periods. MEP values increased in Group 2 in younger and taller children, and in heavier children. MEP values fell with the length of anesthesia. In brief anesthesia, nitrogen was not removed from the middle ear quickly in Group 1: middle ear pressure values were higher. The nitrous oxide remained in the middle ear longer and so the possibility of ear toxicity may increase. In Group 2, 50% O2 was rapidly absorbed and removed from the middle ear and so middle ear pressure was not as high. It may be concluded that air-oxygen mixture (Inspired O2 50%) anesthesia should be recommended as being more reliable in tympanoplasties and other middle ear interventions than a N2O-O2 mixture (Inspired O2 30%).",

Neurological examination revealed paraplegia with syndrome of combined degeneration of the spinal cord. The exploration of cognitive functions showed disorientation in time with memory disorders and disturbance of executive functioning. There was no apraxia, aphasia or agnosia. There were neither psychotic symptoms nor mood changes. ... Red blood count revealed an anemia with macrocytosis (MCV=120 3). Vitamin B12 rate was very low. Folate blood level was normal. Brain MRI showed moderate cerebral atrophy. Other investigations led to the diagnosis of Biermer's disease (fundic atrophy at biopsy with presence in the serum of antibodies to intrinsic factor). The diagnosis of neurological attack related to a vitamin B12 deficiency secondary to Biermer's disease was established, but the appearance of disorders in the post-operative period suggested the existence of an added factor. ... Anesthesia was maintained by nitrous oxide during two hours and the patient exhibited pre-operative anemia with macrocytosis. The hypothesis of decompensation of latent vitamin B12 deficiency by nitrous oxide was evoked. Replacement therapy by vitamin B12 induced real improvement of the cognitive impairment...",

Several investigators have shown that prolonged administration of anesthetic drugs, including ketamine, isoflurane, nitrous oxide and midazolam, produced increased neurodegeneration in 7-day-old rat pups. The combination of the latter three drugs led to altered learning behavior in adulthood. Despite these unequivocal findings in rodents, similar changes cannot be reproduced in other species. Furthermore, withholding anesthesia during painful procedures in neonatal rats resulted in significant long-term aberrant responses to sensory stimulation and pain thresholds. SUMMARY: Taken together, these studies question the applicability of these data to the anesthetic management of the neonate. Further investigations in this area are needed before withholding anesthetics in the anesthetic management of pediatric surgical patients.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Studies have shown that N2O alters the function of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), GABAA, opioid, and serotonin receptors among others. However, the receptors systems underlying the abuse-related central nervous system effects of N2O are unclear. The present study explores the receptor systems responsible for producing the discriminative stimulus effects of N2O. B6SJLF1/J male mice trained to discriminate 10 minutes of exposure to 60% N2O + 40% oxygen versus 100% oxygen served as subjects. Both the high-affinity NMDA receptor channel blocker (+)-MK-801 maleate [(5S,10R)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate] and the low-affinity blocker memantine partially mimicked the stimulus effects of N2O. Neither the competitive NMDA antagonist, CGS-19755 (cis-4-[phosphomethyl]-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid), nor the NMDA glycine-site antagonist, L701-324 [7-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-(3-phenoxy)phenyl-2(1H)-quinolinone], produced N2O-like stimulus effects. A range of GABAA agonists and positive modulators, including midazolam, pentobarbital, muscimol, and gaboxadol (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-3-ol), all failed to produce N2O-like stimulus effects. The mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid agonists, as well as 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 1B/2C (5-HT1B/2C) and 5-HT1A agonists, also failed to produce N2O-like stimulus effects. Ethanol partially substituted for N2O. Both (+)-MK-801 and ethanol but not midazolam pretreatment also significantly enhanced the discriminative stimulus effects of N2O. Our results support the hypothesis that the discriminative stimulus effects of N2O are at least partially mediated by NMDA antagonist effects similar to those produced by channel blockers. However, as none of the drugs tested fully mimicked the stimulus effects of N2O, other mechanisms may also be involved.",

The gas exchanges with nitrogen and diffuses into hollow viscera and body spaces potentially containing air, such as pneumothorax, paranasal sinuses and pneumoperitoneum, or into the cerebral ventricles following pneumoencephalography. This expands the body of trapped air and increases the pressure within such closed spaces. When administration is discontinued, nitrous oxide is released into the alveoli, diluting the alveolar gases. A  reduction in alveolar oxygen tension may result. This is referred to as  diffusion anoxia. Because of the high concentration of nitrous oxide required to produce and maintain anesthesia, hypoxia is an unavoidable accompaniment to its use. During induction with high concentrations of nitrous oxide, the oxygen in the lungs is rapidly used up and the anoxia with increased respiratory effort causes rapid depletion of carbon dioxide in the tissues. Absence of carbon dioxide and depression of the medullary centers by the anesthetic quickly lead to respiratory failure, and rarely, the patient's cerebral function fails to recover from cerebral damage caused by the prolonged anoxia. The brain suffers anoxia from the very beginning of the administration of the gas, and not from just the moment of cessation of  respiratory movements. Thus, the period of anoxia may be five minutes or more, sufficient to cause permanent brain damage in the susceptible individual. The arbitrary \"safe period\" of eight  minutes may be too long for some patients.",

The system relies on a thermoelectrically (TE) cooled continuous-wave (CW) room temperature (RT) quantum cascade laser source emitting wavelength of around 4.6um, where strong fundamental absorption bands occur for the considered specie and its isotopomers. The analysis technique is based on wavelength modulation spectroscopy with second-harmonic detection and the combination of long-path absorption cell. Primary laboratory tests have been performed to estimate the achievable detection limits and the signal reproducibility levels in view of possible measurements of (15)N/(14)N and (18)O/(16)O isotope ratios. The experiment results showed that the site-selective (15)N/(14)N ratio can be measured with a precision of 3 per mil with 90 s averaging time using natural-abundance N2O sample of 12.7ppm."

The repeatability of photoacoustic spectroscopy was measured at 1.12%, which is lower than the repeatability of 3.0% suggested by the ISO 1564 standard, so, it has shown an excellent repeatability. The detection limit was determined to be 0.025 ppm, and the response time was confirmed to be 3 min and 26 s. The results of comparison between these measurements and GC show that the latter has superior accuracy, but mobility and convenience are superior for PAS. On the contrary, GC has a continuous measurement limitation, but PAS makes it possible to conduct continuous measurements. Therefore, PAS can be extremely useful to confirm the characteristics of N2O emissions and to quantify their amount."

Vapors in confined areas may explode when exposed to fire. Containers may explode in fire. Storage containers and parts of containers may rocket great distances, in many directions. If material or contaminated runoff enters waterways, notify downstream users of potentially contaminated waters. Notify local health and fire officials and pollution control agencies. From a secure, explosion-proof location, use water spray to cool exposed containers. If cooling streams are ineffective (venting sound increases in volume and pitch, tank discolors, or shows any signs of deforming), withdraw immediately to a secure position. If cylinders are exposed to excessive heat from fire or flame contact, withdraw immediately to a secure location ...

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The products in a model system with sodium methoxide were described as nitrous oxide and formic acid, presumably as sodium formate. A potential danger in this system should be pointed out: Sodium formate undergoes thermal decomposition to give hydrogen gas (J. Am. Chem. Soc.,DOI: 10.1021/ja02245a004), which explodes spontaneously in the presence of nitrous oxide above critical limits (J. Am. Chem. Soc., DOI: 10.1021/ja01179a036), even in the absence of a catalyst or source of ignition.  The presence of hydrogen and nitrous oxide above a reaction mixture was undoubtedly the cause of an explosion and fire in my laboratory in 1981 during workup of a reaction between sodium and nitric oxide. The major product of the reaction is cis-sodium hyponitrite, which decomposes immediately in water to form sodium hydroxide and nitrous oxide. The employee, a biology major who was badly burned, had carried out the reaction a number of times without incident. This time he tried twice and failed to disperse about 30 g of sodium in toluene and, without consulting me, decided to continue the reaction. The explosion occurred as he was attempting to destroy the unreacted sodium, a lump too large to remove from the flask, by dropwise addition of water. Most of the sodium had reacted at the time of the explosion, and there was no indication of mechanical failure. At the time, I was unaware of the extreme incompatibility of the two gases, and the accident was extremely puzzling. The reaction mixture was close to room temperature and was stirred rapidly while the headspace was flushed with a stream of nitrogen. When I arrived at the laboratory a few minutes after the accident, nitrogen was still flowing from the burned-off end of the plastic tubing.  Since that time, I noticed a reference to the \u201chydrogen explosion\u201d in the ancient chemical literature as a way to identify nitrous oxide.\" (reprint of the full-text)",

No injuries occurred, and damage was contained to the barricaded cell area. Both before and in between these events, NO had been used successfully about 100 times. Each explosion occurred after completion of the reaction, while venting through three-eighths- or one-quarter-inch i.d. Teflon-lined steel-braided tubing to atmospheric pressure.  Static electricity was suspected as the ignition source that, in conjunction with the presence of an oxidant (NO) and fuel (CH3OH), would lead to combustion. To confirm this hypothesis, an investigation was conducted. Preliminary results are communicated here.  The reaction system consisted of NO in conjunction with methanol under basic conditions. A literature search didn\u2019t point to any existing cautionary notes about this reaction. Experimental ignition testing of NO systems was conducted by Fauske & Associates, which showed no combustion unless ignition energy greater than 3 J was used. This exceeds the energy typical of a static discharge, so it does not fully explain the observed combustion. Further analysis of the reaction headspace using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that N2O was formed over time from a simple model system of NO + sodium methoxide + methanol. The conversion of NO to N2O and concomitant oxidation of methanol to formic acid proceeds to 50% in about six hours. Testing showed the energy needed to ignite the headspace of methanol under 1 bar of 50/50 NO/N2O is less than 3 mJ, several orders of magnitude lower than for similar systems without N2O. On the basis of these results, the likely cause of the explosions is the combination of (a) formation of N2O gas and (b) generation of static potential caused by the rapid flow of gas and condensing methanol through the Teflon-lined tubing during rapid depressurization (while venting), which leads to sparking of sufficient energy to cause the combustible vapor to ignite.  We wanted to alert the chemical process industry to risks associated with this particular procedure. Anyone contemplating use of this chemistry should thoroughly evaluate its safety. \" (reprint of full text)",

It is used as anesthetic in dentistry and surgery, propellant gas in food aerosols, leak detection. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: The main complication following inhalation of nitrous oxide is varying degrees of hypoxia, affecting the functions of the heart and the brain. This may be associated with hypotension, fatal cardiac arrhythmias, headache, dizziness, anoxic brain damage, cerebral edema and permanent mental deficit. Chronic exposure can cause neurological and hematological changes including megaloblastic erythropoiesis and neurological features similar to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Nitrous oxide should not be administered for more than 24 hours because of the risk of bone marrow depression. During induction with high concentrations of nitrous oxide, the oxygen in the lungs is rapidly used up and the anoxia with increased respiratory effort causes rapid depletion of carbon dioxide in the issues. Absence of carbon dioxide and depression of the medullary centers by the anesthetic quickly lead to respiratory failure, and rarely, the patient's cerebral function fails to recover from cerebral damage caused by the prolonged anoxia. Nitrous oxide is harmless and non-irritating to the respiratory tract, but concentrations over 50 ppm reduce dexterity, cognition and motor and audiovisual skills.  Neurological manifestations similar to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord were reported following prolonged heavy exposure to nitrous oxide in 15 patients. Poisoning manifested by symptoms such as cyanosis, hypotension and methemoglobinemia occurred in two patients anesthetized with nitrous oxide contaminated with nitric oxide. Psychological dependency on nitrous oxide may occur. Malignant hyperthermia induced by nitrous oxide anesthesia was reported in an eleven year-old girl. No convincing evidence of carcinogenicity in man has been shown by epidemiological studies. The incidence of spontaneous abortion is increased among women exposed to nitrous oxide. It has been suggested, that there is an increased incidence of congenital anomalies in the offspring of women exposed during pregnancy and of spontaneous abortion in the wives of exposed men. No adverse effects were found in a retrospective study of 175 pregnancies during which nitrous oxide was administered. By using single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay), the effect of nitrous oxide on DNA damage in circulating human leukocytes was determined: nitrous oxide increased DNA damage compared with nitrous oxide-free anesthesia. ANIMAL STUDIES: Sedation with 70% nitrous oxide profoundly, but transiently, reduces the activity of cortical methionine synthase but produces lasting impairment in spatial working memory in aged rats. Exposure of pregnant rats to nitrous oxide has caused fetal death, skeletal malformations and various macroscopic lesions. Exposure of pregnant cats on 9th day of gestation to anesthetic concentrations of nitrous oxide-oxygen produces fetal resorption and various skeletal anomalies. Physical dependency and withdrawal have been demonstrated in mice. A long-term study in rats exposed to low concentrations of nitrous oxide did not find increase of neoplasia. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: High triploid rates (> 90%) were induced when newly fertilized rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) eggs were exposed to nitrous oxide at elevated pressure (11 atm) for 0-30 or 0-60 min following fertilization. The triploid yield was lowered following exposure for the longer time period. Triploid rates and therefore triploid yields were reduced following exposure at a lower pressure (5 atm). Treatment of eggs at 1 atm caused no alteration in the triploidy rate.",

The drug discrimination paradigm in animals can be used to study subjective effects of drugs in humans and to test this hypothesis. The goals of the present experiment were to establish N2O discrimination in mice and to compare its discriminative stimulus effects with those of abused volatile vapors and vapor anesthetics. Sixteen B6SJLF1/J mice were trained to discriminate between 10 min of exposure to 60% N2O+40% oxygen (O2) and 10 min of exposure to 100% O2. The time course of N2O discrimination was examined, followed by cross-substitution testing with abused vapors, volatile anesthetics, ethanol, D-amphetamine, and 2-butanol. Mice acquired the ability to discriminate between N2O and O2 in 40 days. N2O fully substituted for 10 min of exposure to 60% N2O in a concentration-dependent manner. Full substitution required 7 min of 60% N2O exposure, but the offset of stimulus effects following the cessation of exposure was more rapid. The aromatic hydrocarbon toluene almost fully substituted for N2O. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane, methoxyflurane, isoflurane, and ethanol showed lesser degrees of substitution. D-amphetamine and the odorant 2-butanol did not substitute for N2O. Given the varying degrees of incomplete substitution by test compounds, the discriminative stimulus properties of N2O and, perhaps, its subjective effects in humans are probably not unique. As none of the inhalants tested fully mimicked N2O, its overall effects may include one or more novel stimulus components.",

The NMDA receptors are considered as the primary site of action of the anesthetic gases xenon (Xe) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Despite the rapid on/off kinetics of these gases on the NMDA receptor, a brief gas exposure can induce an analgesic or antireward effect lasting several days. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of both Xe and N2O on alcohol-seeking and relapse-like drinking behavior (measured as the alcohol deprivation effect) in Wistar rats. We used 2 standard procedures-the alcohol deprivation model with repeated deprivation phases and the cue-induced reinstatement model of alcohol seeking-to study the effect of 2 brief gas exposures of either Xe, N2O, or control gas on relapse-like drinking and alcohol-seeking behavior. Here, we show that exposure to Xe during the last 24 hours of abstinence produced a trend toward reduced ethanol intake during the first alcohol re-exposure days. In addition, Xe gas exposure significantly decreased the cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior. N2 O had no effect on either behavior. Xe reduces alcohol-seeking behavior in rats and may therefore also interfere with craving in human alcoholics.",

Isoflurane and sevoflurane represent the class of volatile substances, and nitrous oxide (N2O) comprises a class of its own. Fourteen healthy volunteers inhaled the vehicle (100% O2) and two concentrations each of isoflurane (0.1 and 0.2%), sevoflurane (0.2 and 0.4%), and N2O (15 and 30%) for 40 min each, across seven separate sessions. Drug concentrations were chosen to produce similar ratings of drug effect strength and similar impairment on a psychomotor test, the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST). Ratings of drug effect strength and performance on the DSST were similar across drugs; however, the volatile anesthetics produced greater sedation and greater impairment on three other psychomotor tests than N2O, whereas N2O produced a greater magnitude of putatively pleasant and psychedelic-like subjective effects. These results are consistent with the drugs' putative receptor mechanisms of action and confirm Balster's classification of the volatile anesthetics into a class distinct from N2O.",

In an attempt to assess and quantitate psychomotor dysfunction, P-300 event related potentials, Symbol Digit Test, Continuous Performance Test, and Finger Tapping Test were obtained from six subjects sequentially exposed to nitrous oxide (N2O) at 0%, 10%, 20%, and 40%. With increasing concentrations of N20, there was prolongation of P-300 latency and worsening of Continuous Performance Test and Symbol Digit Test performances; P-300 amplitude and Finger Tapping Test performance were decreased by exposure to N2O. This study demonstrates a dose dependent reduction in P-300 amplitude and prolongation of P-300 latency in subjects in whom psychomotor impairment has been induced by the acute administration of N2O.",

Patients and observers were blind to group identity. The primary endpoint was duration of hospital stay. Secondary endpoints included duration of intensive care stay and postoperative complications; the latter included severe nausea and vomiting, and the following major complications: pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, wound infection, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, stroke, awareness, and death within 30 days of surgery. ... Of 3,187 eligible patients, 2,050 consenting patients were recruited. Patients in the nitrous oxide-free group had significantly lower rates of major complications (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.89; P = 0.003) and severe nausea and vomiting (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.51; P < 0.001), but median duration of hospital stay did not differ substantially between groups (7.0 vs. 7.1 days; P = 0.06). Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively, those in the nitrous oxide-free group were more likely to be discharged from the unit on any given day than those in the nitrous oxide group (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.73; P = 0.02). Conclusions: Avoidance of nitrous oxide and the concomitant increase in inspired oxygen concentration decreases the incidence of complications after major surgery, but does not significantly affect the duration of hospital stay. The routine use of nitrous oxide in patients undergoing major surgery should be questioned.",

Computer based neurobehavioral evaluation system was developed to standardize data collection in epidemiological field studies of individuals at risk for neurobehavioral toxicity. Twelve men 18 to 36 yr old were tested with the neurobehavioral evaluation system 3 times, in an initial training session followed by separate drug and control sessions in randomized order. During drug sessions, subjects received a combination of 20% nitrous oxide (N2O) and 80% oxygen through a nasal mask. In control sessions subjects received 100% oxygen. Nine neurobehavioral evaluation system tests evaluating psychomotor performance, visuospatial ability, memory, and mood were administered in approx 40 min. N2O exposure impaired performance on 3 tests: continuous performance, symbol digit substitution, and finger tapping.",

Since high doses or prolonged exposure to other NMDA antagonists can cause neurons to die, ... whether prolonged N2O exposure might also cause neuronal cell death /was examined/. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 150-vol% N2O (approximately EC50 for N2O anesthesia in rats) for various durations from 1 to 16 hr. The time course for onset and disappearance of the reversible vacuole reaction was studied, as was the time course and dose requirement for triggering cell death. A maximum vacuole reaction was observed in PC/RSC neurons in brains examined immediately after 3 hr of 150-vol% N2O exposure and the same magnitude of vacuole reaction was observed when brains were examined immediately after a longer period of N2O exposure. When N2O was terminated at 3 hr and the rats were killed 1 hr later, the vacuole reaction was markedly diminished and if the rats were killed 3 hr later the vacuole reaction had completely disappeared. Prolonged exposure to 150-vol% N2O (for 8 hr or more) caused neuronal cell death which was detectable by silver staining 32 hr later. Concurrently administered GABAergic agents, diazepam (an i.v. anesthetic), or isoflurane (an inhalational anesthetic), prevented this cell death reaction...",

The cerebral microcirculation of Mongolian gerbils was investigated by fluorescent intravital microscopy for up to 7 hr after induction of anesthesia ... induced and maintained with isoflurane or halothane alone or in combination with nitrous oxide (70%). The number of leukocytes that were rolling along and firmly adherent to the endothelial wall of cerebral venules was significantly elevated in animals anesthetized with nitrous oxide in combination with isoflurane and halothane compared to isoflurane and halothane alone. A significantly increased number of neutrophil granulocytes invading the brain parenchyma in histological slices from animals treated with the combination of isoflurane or halothane and nitrous oxide compared to controls treated with isoflurane or halothane alone was observed. /The/ data show that prolonged anesthesia with nitrous oxide induces inflammation of the cerebral microcirculation and brain.",

It also is considered to be detrimental to the ozone layer. The rate of N2O emission varies widely from 1 to more than 10 kilograms per metric ton (kg/t) of 100 percent nitric acid. Abatement techniques can reduce N2O emissions significantly but are costly. The International Fertilizer Industry Association ... estimated that fertilizer production accounts for about 6 percent of human-generated N2O emissions compared with nearly 50 percent from motor vehicles. Most N2O recycles to land and water, and as with CO2, larger quantities are emitted through natural biological processes. N2O is estimated to be responsible for 7.5 percent of the calculated global warming effect of human activities. Fertilizer production is estimated to be responsible for less than 0.5 percent of this effect.",

These are gases which allow direct sunlight (relative shortwave energy) to reach the Earth's surface unimpeded. As the shortwave energy (that in the visible and ultraviolet portion of the spectra) heats the surface, longer-wave (infrared) energy (heat) is reradiated to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases absorb this energy, thereby allowing less heat to escape back to space, and 'trapping' it in the lower atmosphere. Many greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and nitrous oxide, while others are synthetic. Those that are man-made include the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), as well as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Atmospheric concentrations of both the natural and man-made gases have been rising over the last few centuries due to the industrial revolution. As the global population has increased and our reliance on fossil fuels (such as coal, oil and natural gas) has been firmly solidified, so emissions of these gases have risen. While gases such as carbon dioxide occur naturally in the atmosphere, through our interference with the carbon cycle (through burning forest lands, or mining and burning coal), we artificially move carbon from solid storage to its gaseous state, thereby increasing atmospheric concentrations(1). /Greenhouse Gases/",

Application of cattle slurry to mixed clover rye grass sward in the Basque region of Spain resulted in 16.0% of the NH4-N applied being lost to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide(2). Nitrous oxide was found to be produced by combustion of natural gas, No.6 fuel oil and coal-water slurries(3). Ship emissions account for 15% of the global Nox emissions with nearly 70% emissions occurring within 400 km of land. The 2009 annual in-port emission of nitrous oxide in the Yangshan port, Hangzhou Bay, Shanghai was reported as 33 tons. Annual emissions based on activity/source are as follows (tons): at-sea, 13.7; maneuvering, 3.3; hotelling-berth, 12.2; hotelling anchorage, 3.4; resulting in total emissions of 32.6 tons/year. Ship engine emissions factors are 0.031, 0.031 and 0.080 g/kw-hr from a main engine, auxiliary engine and boiler, respectively. Annual ship emissions based on engine type are as follows (tons): main engine, 12.7; auxiliary engine, 10.9; boiler, 9.9, resulting in total emissions of 32.5 tons/year(4).",

In addition, there is a lack of field reports of the impacts of biochar on soil physical properties, gaseous emissions and C stability, particularly in comparison with other amendments. Thus, three amendments - biochar produced from oak at 650 \u00b0C, humic acid (HA) and water treatment residual - (WTR) were added to a scalped silty-loam soil at 0.5% (w/w) in triplicated plots under soybean. Over the 4-month active growing season, all amendments significantly increased soil pH, but the effect of biochar was the greatest. Biochar significantly increased soil-C by 7%, increased sub-nanopore surface area by 15% and reduced soil bulk density by 13% compared to control. However, only WTR amendment significantly increased soil nanopore surface area by 23% relative to the control. While total cumulative CH4 and CO2 emissions were not significantly affected by any amendment, cumulative N2O emission was significantly decreased in the biochar-amended soil (by 92%) compared to control over the growing period. Considering both the total gas emissions and the C removed from the atmosphere as crop growth and C added to the soil, WTR and HA resulted in net soil C losses and biochar as a soil C gain. However, all amendments reduced the global warming potential (GWP) of the soil and biochar addition even produced a net negative GWP effect. The short observation period, low application rate and high intra-treatment variation resulted in fewer significant effects of the amendments on the physicochemical properties of the soils than one might expect indicating further possible experimentation altering these variables. However, there was clear evidence of amendment-soil interaction processes affecting both soil properties and gaseous emissions, particularly for biochar, that might lead to greater changes with additional field emplacement time.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

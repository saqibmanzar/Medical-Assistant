When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

HUMAN STUDIES: Inhalation of a high vapor concentration can result in gasping, refusal to breathe, coughing, substernal pain, and extreme respiratory distress at vapor concentration over 1500 ppm. Irritation of eyes and upper respiratory mucosa appears promptly after exposure to concentrated vapors. Lacrimation and headache are prominent. Coma may occur rapidly. Inhalation of a low vapor concentration may cause central nervous depression and moderate irritation of respiratory system. Headache is frequent. Dermal exposure causes severe skin irritation with marked inflammatory response of epidermis and underlying tissues. Oral exposure may lead to acute gastrointestinal distress with pulmonary congestion and edema, as well as central nervous depression, perhaps even in the absence of impaired oxygen uptake. Exposure by any route may cause possible late injuries to liver, kidneys and heart. After inhalation exposures, malaise, headache, chest and abdominal discomfort and irritability have been reported to persist for several weeks and perhaps for several years. ANIMAL STUDIES: It was tested externally on eyes of rabbits and rated 2 on scale of 1-10 according to degree of injury observed after 24 hr, paying particular attention to condition of cornea. Most severe injuries have rated 10.",

Some fumigants are corrosive to the cornea and may cause BLINDNESS. Specialized medical treatment should be obtained promptly following removal of toxicant by copious flushing with clean water. Skin contamination may cause BLISTERING and deep chemical burns. Absorption of some fumigants across the skin may be sufficient to cause systemic poisoning in the absence of fumigant inhalation. For all these reasons, decontamination of eyes and skin must must be IMMEDIATE and THROUGH. 2. REMOVE victims of fumigant inhalation to FRESH AIR immediately. Even though initial symptoms and signs are mild, keep the victim quiet, in a semi-reclining position. Minimum pohysical activity limits the likehood ofpulmonary edema. 3. If victim is not breathing, clear the airway of secretions and RESUSCITATE with positive poressure oxygen apparatus. If this is not available, use chest compression to sustain respiration. If victim is pulseless, employ cardiac resuscitation. 4. If PULMONARY EDEMA is evident, there are several measures avilable to sustain life. Medical judgement must be relied upon, however, in the management of each case. The following procedures are generally recommended: A. Put the victim in a SITTING position with a backrest. B. Use intermittent and/or continuous positive pressure OXYGEN to relieve hypoxemia. ... C. Slowly administer FUROSEMIDE, 40 mg, or SODIUM ETHACRYNATE, 50 mg, to reduce venous load by inducing diuresis. ... D. Morphine in small doses (5-10 mg), slowly, iv to allay anxiety and promote deeper respiratory excursions. E. Administer AMINOPHYLLINE (0.25-0.50 gm) slowly, iv. ... F. Digitalization may be considered, but there is a serious risk of arrhythmias in an anoxic and toxic myocardium. G. TRACHEOSTOMY may be necessary in some cases to facilitate aspiration of large amounts of pulmonary edema fluid. H. Epinephrine, atorpine, and expectorants are generally not helpful, and may complicate treatment. I. Watch for RECURRENT PULMONARY EDEMA, even up to 2 weeks after the initial episode. Limit victim's physical activity for at least 4 weeks. Severe physical weakness usually indicates persistent pulmonary injury. Serial pulmonary function testing may be useful in assessing recovery. 5. Combat SHOCK by placing victim in the Trendelenburg position and administering plasma, whole blood, and/or electrolyte and glucose solutions intravenously, with great care, to avoid pulmonary edema. Central venous pressure should be monitored continously. Vasopressor amines must be given with great caution, because of the irritability of the myocardium. 6. Control CONVULSIONS. Seizures are most likely to occur in poisonings by methyl bromide, hydrogen cyanide, acrylonitrile, phosphine, and carbon disulfide. ... /Fumigant poisoning/",

B) Inhalation, low vapor concentration: central nervous depression and moderate irritation of respiratory system. Headache is frequent. 2) Dermal: severe skin irritation with marked inflammatory response of epidermis and underlying tissues. 3) Oral: acute gastrointestinal distress with pulmonary congestion and edema. Central nervous depression, perhaps even in the absence of impaired oxygen uptake. 4) By any route, possible late injuries to liver, kidneys and heart. 5) After inhalation exposures, malaise, headache, chest and abdominal discomfort and irritability have been reported to persist for several weeks and perhaps for several years.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 68.3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1-dichloropropane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,1-dichloropropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 days. 1,1,-Dichloropropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,1-dichloropropane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 61. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.8X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1-Dichloropropane was degraded by an anaerobic enrichment culture able to reductively dechlorinate 1,2-dichloropropane however biodegradation is not expected to be an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, 1,1-dichloropropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hrs and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 14 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Alkyl halides are susceptible to neutral and basic hydrolysis, but additional halides on a carbon atom greatly decreases the hydrolysis rate. Occupational exposure to 1,1-dichloropropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1-dichloropropane is produced or used. The general public is not expected to be exposed to 1,1-dichloropropane. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.8X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 68.3 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 2,700 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hrs and 4 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 14(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.25(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Alkyl halides are susceptible to neutral and basic hydrolysis, but additional halides on a carbon atom markedly decreases the hydrolysis rate(7). 1,1-Dichloropropane was degraded by an anaerobic enrichment culture able to reductively dechlorinate 1,2-dichloropropane(8); however, biodegradation is not expected to be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase 1,1,-dichloropropane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.5X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 1,1,-Dichloropropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

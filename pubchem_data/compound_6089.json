When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Adult male Holtzman rats trained to press a bar (respond) for milk reward on a 4-response fixed-ratio schedule were given i.p. injections of 3.2 or 10 mg/kg of DMT every 2 hours for 21 days. Every 24 hours the animals were placed in operant chambers for 30 minutes before a scheduled injection and were left in the chambers for 30 to 80 minutes after. During the first week of chronic treatment, daily bar pressing worsened progressively until the 6th day of the series, at which time rats in the 10 mg/kg group did not bar press at all. As the chronic injections continued, rates of bar pressing gradually increased until responding was not disrupted at all by an injection of DMT. Rats in the 3.2 mg/kg group showed cross-tolerance to an injection of LSD (0.1 mg/kg). Another group of rats was made partially tolerant to the disruptive effects of LSD (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) on bar pressing with a series of injections given once per day for 21 days and then three times per day for the next 4 days. Cross tolerance was not demonstrated to a challenge injection of 10 mg/kg of DMT. The LSD injections were continued for another 3 to 5 days until the animals were completely tolerant to the LSD. They then displayed cross-tolerance to 3.2 mg/kg of DMT.",

Tolerance to \"psychedelic\" subjective effects did not occur according to either clinical interview or Hallucinogen Rating Scale scores. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, cortisol, and heart rate responses decreased with repeated DMT administration, although blood pressure did not.

The urinary excretion of both compounds was unrelated to age, sex, urinary volume, or creatinine, nor was any consistent diurnal pattern observed. Rates for the mono and dimethylated compounds were not correlated. Diet and the intestinal flora were excluded as a source of urinary dimethyltryptamine. Administration to 4 subjects of sufficient ammonium chloride to /decrease/ the /pH/ of the urine caused a transient increase in dimethyltryptamine excretion but no consistent increase in the rate for N-methyltryptamine.

DMT along with its proposed precursor, tryptamine, were identified and quantitated as the heptafluorobutyryl derivatives. A specific high affinity binding site on synaptosomal membranes has been proposed for DMT. This proposal is based on equilibrium dialysis experiments which indicate that DMT at a concentration of 1X10-5M will displace d-LSD on isolated membranes but will not displace bound serotonin at the same concentration. When DMT interacts with the synaptosomal membranes at a concentration of 5X10-10M, the membrane-bound enzyme adenylate cyclase is stimulated such that adenosine3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) is produced at a rate of 100 pM/min/mg of protein (2.3 times the endogenous rate). It has also been shown that its presumed precursor, tryptamine, inhibits this process. ... From data obtained in this study it has been postulated that DMT may have in vivo activity similar to those proposed for neurotransmitters or other neuroregulatory agents. ...",

The affinity of DMT for 5-HT1A sites labeled by (3)H-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (3)H-8-OH-DPAT) was decreased in the presence of 1X10-4 M GTP, suggesting agonist activity of DMT at this receptor. Adenylate cyclase studies in rat hippocampi showed that DMT inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclase activity, a 5-HT1A agonist effect. DMT displayed full agonist activity with an EC50 of 4X10-6 M in the cyclase assay. In contrast to the agonist actions of DMT at 5-HT1A receptors, DMT appeared to have antagonistic properties at 5-HT2 receptors. The ability of DMT to compete for (3)H-ketanserin-labeled 5-HT2 receptors was not affected by the presence of 1X10-4 M GTP, suggesting antagonist activity of DMT at 5-HT2 receptors. In addition, DMT antagonized 5-HT2-receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover in rat cortex at concentrations above 1X10-7 M, with 70% of the 5-HT-induced PI response inhibited at 1X10-4 M DMT. Micromolar concentrations of DMT produced a slight PI stimulation that was not blocked by the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin. These studies suggest that DMT has opposing actions on 5-HT receptor subtypes, displaying agonist activity at 5-HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT2 receptors.",

Thus, the reported extension of half-life and potentiation of DMT behavioral effects by iproniazid may be due to inhibition of NMT and DMT-NO formation rather than inhibition of monoamine oxidase.

Pretreatment (5--10 min) with behaviorally ineffective doses of naloxone (1.0--5.6 mg/kg) dramatically enhanced the effects of DMT ... The content of DMT in the brain and liver of rats injected with DMT alone (10 mg/kg) and with a 5 min pretreatment of naloxone (3.2 mg/kg) was determined by radiochemical analysis at 30 and 90 min after (14)C-DMT injection. There was no significant difference for either brain or liver (14)C-DMT levels when control DMT rats were compared with the naloxone pretreated rats. These results seem to rule out interference by naloxone with the metabolism of DMT as a mechanism of the observed behavioral potentiation.",

Twelve highly motivated volunteers received two doses (0.04 and 0.4 mg/kg) of intravenous (IV) dimethyltryptamine fumarate \"nonblind,\" before entering a double-blind, saline placebo-controlled, randomized study using four doses of IV DMT. Subjects were carefully interviewed after resolution of drug effects, providing thorough and systematic descriptions of DMT's effects.  ... Psychological effects of IV DMT began almost immediately after administration, peaked at 90 to 120 seconds, and were almost completely resolved by 30 min. This time course paralleled DMT blood levels previously described. Hallucinogenic effects were seen after 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg of dimethyltryptamine fumarate, and included a rapidly moving, brightly colored visual display of images. Auditory effects were less common. \"Loss of control,\" associated with a brief, but overwhelming \"rush,\" led to a dissociated state, where euphoria alternated or coexisted with anxiety. These effects completely replaced subjects' previously ongoing mental experience and were more vivid and compelling than dreams or waking awareness. Lower doses, 0.1 and 0.05 mg/kg, were primarily affective and somaesthetic, while 0.1 mg/kg elicited the least desirable effects. ... /Dimethyltryptamine fumarate/",

Dimethyltryptamine, an endogenous mammalian hallucinogen and drug of abuse, was administered intravenously at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg to 11 experienced hallucinogen users, in a double-blind, saline placebo-controlled, randomized design. Treatments were separated by at least 1 week. Peak DMT blood levels and subjective effects were seen within 2 minutes after drug administration, and were negligible at 30 minutes. Dimethyltryptamine dose dependently elevated blood pressure, heart rate, pupil diameter, and rectal temperature, in addition to elevating blood concentrations of beta-endorphin, corticotropin, cortisol, and prolactin. Growth hormone blood levels rose equally in response to all doses of DMT, and melatonin levels were unaffected. Threshold doses for significant effects relative to placebo were also hallucinogenic (0.2 mg/kg and higher). Subjects with five or more exposures to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine demonstrated less robust pupil diameter effects than those with two or fewer exposures... /Dimethyltryptamine fumarate/",

Systemic administration of these agents, which distributes to both the brain and spinal cord, produced opposite effects, as DMT depressed and 5-MeODMT increased acoustic startle. However, when administered directly into the lateral ventricle in the forebrain (intraventricular administration) 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), DMT and 5-MeODMT all depressed acoustic startle, DMT and 5-MeODMT being about equipotent in this regard. In contrast, when administered directly into the spinal cord subarachnoid space (intrathecal administration), 5-HT and 5-MeODMT increased startle, whereas DMT was without effect. In another series of studies, the effects of systemically-administered DMT and 5-MeODMT on the \"startle\" elicited by electrical stimulation of the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis (RPC) were determined. Since the RPC is the last nucleus of the primary startle circuit before the spinal cord, agents which act downstream from the RPC (i.e., in the lower brainstem and spinal cord) would be expected to alter RPC-elicited \"startle,\" while agents which act upstream from the RPC would be without effect. Given systemically, 5-MeODMT markedly increased RPC-elicited \"startle\" while DMT was without effect. These data indicate that DMT and 5-MeODMT are equipotent in depressing startle through actions in the brain. In contrast, the difference in the effects of DMT and 5-MeODMT on acoustic startle is related to the spinal excitatory effects of 5-MeODMT which DMT does not possess. ...",

Both drugs produced an inhibition of fighting at higher doses but no significant effects at lower doses. The effects of these drugs on shock elicited fighting, as well as on other behaviors, thus differ from those of another indole hallucinogen, d-lysergic acid diethylamide, and are discussed in relation to their effects on single unit activity of the raphe-serotonin system and their interaction with other neurotransmitter systems.",

DMT (0.5-8.0 mg/kg i.p.) administered to male Swiss S mice (20-25 g) induced a dose-dependent hyperactivity syndrome comprising increased locomotor activity accompanied by prostration, hind-limb abduction, tremor, Straub tail, retropulsion, jerking and vocalization. Onset of activity occurred within 5 min but was of short duration (20-40 min)...Administration of DMT (0.5-35 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats (200-300 g) produced a similar dose dependent behavioral syndrome to that seen in mice. ... /Investigators/ suggest that the DMT-induced behavioral syndrome comprises two components. One consists of increased motor activity and can be manipulated by drugs acting on cerebral 5-HT and dopamine receptors. The other behavioral changes, however do not appear to be mediated via a monoamine pathway.",

The compound occurs naturally in plants with halucinogenic properties. It has been isolated from the leaves of tropical plants such as Prestonia amazonica, Haemadictyon amazonicum, and Apocynaceae. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.1X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates N,N-dimethyltryptamine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase N,N-dimethyltryptamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 27 minutes. Particulate-phase N,N-dimethyltryptamine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. N,N-Dimethyltryptamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, N,N-dimethyltryptamine is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3000. The estimated pKa of N,N-dimethyltryptamine is 8.68, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an cation and cations do not volatilize. N,N-Dimethyltryptamine may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, N,N-dimethyltryptamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A pKa of 8.68 indicates N,N-dimethyltryptamine will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Exposure to N,N-dimethyltryptamine among the general population may be limited to those abusing the drug. (SRC)",

Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). A pKa of 8.68(5) indicates N,N-dimethyltryptamine will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 9(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 1.94(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2012).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

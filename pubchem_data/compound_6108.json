When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They an utilized 4-nitrotoluene, 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol or 4-nitrobenzoate as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen. One strain, TW3, was used for more detailed studies. 4-Nitrotoluene-grown cells of TW3 take up O2 when incubated in the presence of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-nitrobenzoate. PHLC analysis of culture supernatants showed that 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-nitrobenzoate were formed when 4-nitrotoluene-grown cells were incubated with 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, whereas only 4-nitrobenzoate was found when they were incubated with 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. ... It is proposed that the pathway for 4-nitrotoluene catabolism proceeds via 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-nitrobenzoate and ultimately to protocatechuate with release of the nitro group as ammonium.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Dose levels in 13-week and 2-year studies ranged from 630-10,000 ppm and 1,250-5,000 ppm, respectively. At 13 weeks, renal lesions included minimal to mild hyaline droplet accumulation in male rats and karyomegaly in male and female rats. At 2 years, renal lesions included proximal tubule epithelial cell hyperplasia in male rats and oncocytic hyperplasia in high-dose male and female rats, and a decreased severity of nephropathy in males and females. The hyaline droplets in renal tubular epithelial cells of male rats at 13 weeks were morphologically similar to those described in alpha2u-globulin nephropathy. Using immunohistochemical methods, alpha2u-globulin accumulation was associated with the hyaline droplets. In addition, at 13 weeks, cell proliferation as detected by PCNA immunohistochemistry was significantly increased in males exposed to 5,000 and 10,000 ppm when compared to controls. Cytotoxicity associated with alpha2U-globulin nephropathy such as single-cell necrosis of the P2 segment epithelium or accumulation of granular casts in the outer medulla did not occur in the 13-week study. In addition, chronic treatment related nephrotoxic lesions attributed to accumulation of alpha2u-globulin such as linear foci of mineralization within the renal papilla, hyperplasia of the renal pelvis urothelium and kidney tumors were not observed. Although there was histologic evidence of alpha2u-globulin accumulation in male rats at 13 weeks, the minimal severity of nephropathy suggests that the degree of cytotoxicity was below the threshold, which would contribute to the development of renal tumors at 2 years",

Utilizing cytochrome c reduction and cyanide-insensitive oxygen consumption assays for O2-, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) hepatic microsomes were exposed to nitrofurantoin (NF), p-nitrobenzoic acid (PNBA) and m-dinitrobenzene (MDNB). NF and PNBA were chosen for study as model nitroaromatic compounds, known to stimulate microsomal O2- generation in mammals; MDNB was chosen because it frequently contaminates aquatic systems. The results demonstrated that each of the three nitroaromatics is capable of significantly enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitable cytochrome c reduction and oxygen consumption, providing specific evidence of stimulated microsomal production of O2- by the fish species examined. The results also indicated chemical- and species-specific differences in stimulated O2- production. In both assay systems, enhancement by NF exceeded that produced by MDNB and, more pronouncedly, PNBA. Furthermore, although similar responses to all nitroaromatics were observed in microsomes isolated from catfish and bass, the assays employing trout microsomes demonstrated the greatest enhancement in NF and MDNB exposures. These findings suggest that the stimulation of O2- production may be an important mode of action for these common aquatic pollutants that merits further ecotoxicological assessment.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.5X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-nitrobenzoic acid will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-nitrobenzoic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 27 days. Particulate-phase 4-nitrobenzoic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. p-Aminobenzoic acid was formed when 4-nitrobenzoic acid underwent photolysis in isopropanol at a wavelength of 316 nm. If released to soil, 4-nitrobenzoic acid is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 250. The pKa of 4-nitrobenzoic acid is 3.44, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.8X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. 4-Nitrobenzoic acid may biodegrade in soil based on 62% degradation after 2 weeks in activated sludge inoculum during a Japanese MITI test, however, it took more than 64 days to decompose in a soil microflora inoculum with mineral salts medium. If released into water, 4-nitrobenzoic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. 4-Nitrobenzoic acid is expected to biodegrade in water based on 62% degradation after 2 weeks in activated sludge inoculum during a Japanese MITI test and 52% of its BOD in river water collected from the Songhua River, China after 5 days. A pKa of 3.44 indicates 4-nitrobenzoic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 4-nitrobenzoic acid may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-nitrobenzoic acid is produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 4-nitrobenzoic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 27 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.9X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase 4-nitrobenzoic acid may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). 4-Nitrobenzoic acid, in isopropanol, was reduced at a wavelength of 316 nm to 4-aminobenzoic(4). Therefore, 4-nitrobenzoic is expected to undergo direct photolysis(SRC). The C6H4COOH radical was generated by photolysis of 4-nitrobenzoic acid using spin-trapping of photolysis products(5).",

After 180 minutes, little oxygen consumption by phenol adapted biological cultures occurred with 4-nitrobenzoic acid(2). The amounts of oxygen consumed after the 180 minute test time are 55 uL (endogenous), 64 uL (cells plus 100 mg/L 3-nitrobenzoic acid), and 346 uL (cells plus phenol - after 90 minutes) which results in a ratio of only 1.2 endogenous to 4-nitrobenzoic acid oxygen consumption(2). In a 2 week Japanese MITI test using 100 mg/L 4-nitrobenzoic acid and 30 mg/L sludge, 4-nitrobenzoic had a theoretical BOD of 62%(3). 4-Nitrobenzene reached 50.2% of its BOD in river water collected from Songhua River, China after 5 days. The river water samples contained about 8.0 mg/L dissolved oxygen, 800-3000/mL bacteria counts, pH 6.8-7.0, and temperatures of 15-20 \u00b0C(4).",

In the AFNOR test, 4-nitrobenzoic acid gave 96 and 97 percent removal of DOC in 28 and 42 days, respectively, with no inhibition(2). The UV absorbency of the mononitrobenzoic acid compounds disappeared in 7 days when incubated with sewage effluent in the presence of oxygen, suggesting ring cleavage and possible mineralization(3). The lag time for the degradation of 16 mg/L of 4-nitrobenzoic acid was 3-5 days by wastewater and soil(4). The degradation of 4-nitrobenzoate by domestic sewage was inhibited by benzoate(5). According to the Japanese MITI test, 4-nitrobenzoic acid is considered to be readily biodegradable(6). Three moles of hydrogen are required to reduce the nitro group to an amino group in microbial transformations with the para nitro group being more readily reduced than the ortho group for nitrobenzoic acids(7).",

The probable metabolic pathway for the breakdown of 4-nitrobenzoate in activated sludge is 4-nitrobenzoic acid to p-aminobenzoic acid to p-hydroxybenzoic acid to protocatechuic acid to beta-ketoadipic acid to succinic acid(3). 4-Nitrobenzoic acid biodegraded after a lag of 60-65 hours at a rate of 0.042-0.060 per hour which corresponds to a half-life of 140-170 hours using an electrolytic respirometer(4).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 27 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). A study in aqueous media involving the reactivity of aromatic compounds toward hydroxyl radicals found that the reaction rate of the p-nitrobenzoate ion toward hydroxyl radicals is 1.17X10-9 per M per sec(2). 4-Nitrobenzoic acid is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). 4-Nitrobenzoic acid, in isopropanol, was reduced at a wavelength of 316 nm to 4-aminobenzoic acid(4). Therefore, 4-nitrobenzoic acid is expected to undergo direct photolysis(SRC). The C6H4COOH radical was generated by photolysis of 4-nitrobenzoic acid using spin-trapping of photolysis products(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

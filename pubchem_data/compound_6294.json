ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Novel results from competitive binding assays showed that o,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDT, as well as the established environmental estrogen o,p'-DDT, were able to bind specifically to the hER with approximately 1000-fold weaker affinities for the hER than that of estradiol. In contrast, only o,p'-DDT, but not p,p'-DDT, bound to the rat estrogen receptor. Moreover, two yeast expression-reporter systems, constructed to test if the DDT isomers and metabolites could transcriptionally activate the hER, demonstrated that an o,p'-DDT metabolite could transactivate the hER or LexA-hER fusion protein with just a 140- to 300-fold weaker potency than that of estradiol. The DDT isomers and metabolites that bound the hER in vitro triggered estrogen receptor-mediated transcription of the lacZ reporter gene in the yeast systems. Furthermore, the DDT isomers and metabolites that transactivated the hER elicited an additive response when given together or with estradiol. The DDT isomers and metabolites that triggered transcription of the yeast expression-reporter systems also stimulated two estrogenic endpoints in estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cells: the induction of the progesterone receptor and the down-regulation of the hER. Thus, in MCF-7 cells and in yeast expression-reporter systems, certain DDT isomers and metabolites act directly as agonists and transactivate the hER at concentrations found in human tissues.",

In transactivation assays using both yeast and T47D cells, o,p'-DDT and the metabolites p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDA, and DDOH inhibited progesterone-induced reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner. None of the DDT metabolites functioned as hPR agonists. Whole cell competition binding assays using T47D cells indicated that the inhibitory effects of DDT metabolites on progesterone-dependent activites may occur through both hPR-dependent and hPR-independent pathways. Our results and previous reports of DDT metabolites interacting with estrogen and androgen receptors suggests that this class of environmental chemicals may interact with numerous hormone receptor signaling pathways.",

Acute exposures to o,p'-DDD inhibited ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion while cell viability decreased significantly only at the highest concentration tested (200 microM o,p'-DDD). Stimulation of cortisol secretion with a cAMP analogue (dibutyryl-cAMP) was inhibited at a higher concentration than that needed to inhibit ACTH-stimulated cortisol synthesis in cells exposed to o,p'-DDD. Forskolin-stimulated cortisol secretion and cAMP production, and NaF-stimulated cAMP production were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by o,p'-DDD. In contrast, basal cortisol secretion was stimulated while basal cAMP production was unaffected by o,p'-DDD. Pregnenolone-stimulated cortisol secretion was enhanced by o,p'-DDD at a physiologically relevant pregnenolone concentration, while o,p'-DDD inhibited cortisol secretion when a pharmacological concentration of pregnenolone was used. /These/ results suggest that the cAMP generation step is a target in o,p'-DDD-mediated disruption of ACTH-stimulated adrenal steroidogenesis in rainbow trout but that other downstream targets such as steroidogenic enzymes responsible for cortisol synthesis might also be affected.",

Toxic effects may be exerted from all routes of exposure (ie, ingestion, inhalation, or dermal contact) and range from irritation of the skin, eyes, nose and throat, and liver damage, to possibly death in extreme exposure cases (estimated fatal oral dose for humans: 5 g/kg of body weight). These effects may be protected against by the wearing of rubber gloves, goggles or face shield or a self-contained breathing apparatus. Protect from exposure, individuals with liver disease. In cases where contact with the odorless, colorless dust of DDD is unavoidable, contaminated clothing and shoes should be removed and the affected areas of the body flushed with water. DDD will not ignite easily, but it will burn with the potential to emit irritating or poisonous gases. For small fires involving DDD, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, or foam, and for large fires, use water spray, fog, or foam. Runoff from fire control water may give off poisonous gases or cause water pollution and should, therefore, be diked for later disposal. DDD should be stored at ambient temperature in containers that bear the label, \"Keep Away From Food\". All modes of transport are acceptable for DDD (ie, air, road, rail, and water). Small spills of DDD should be carefully shovelled into a container (liquid DDD is first absorbed by a non-combustible material, like sand) for later disposal. Large land spills are diked or deposited in excavated pits, ponds, or other holding areas (dry spills are covered with plastic sheeting) for later disposal. Large spills on water first may need to be trapped at the bottom with sand bag barriers or treated by an application of activated charcoal, then removed by suction hose or mechanical dredge.

DDD reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDD inhibits the inactivation of voltaged-gated sodium channels. The channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization and resulting in a state of hyperexcitability. DDD inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDD also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. DDD is also believed to adversely affect the reproductive system by mimicking endogenous hormones and binding to the estrogen and adrogen receptors. (T10, L85)",

The findings suggest a possible carcinogenic effect of TDE in male Osborne-Mendel rats, based on the induction of combined follicular-cell carcinomas and follicular-cell adenomas of the thyroid. Because of the variation of these tumors in control male rats in this study, the evidence does not permit a more conclusive interpretation of these lesions. p,p'-DDE was carcinogenic in B6C3F1 mice, causing hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes.",

Aspirate oral and pharyngeal secretion, and when possible, insert an oropharyngeal airway to maintain an open passage unobstructed by the tongue. Minimize noise and any manipulation of the patient that may trigger seizure activity. Seizures in patients caused by organochlorine toxicity are likely to be prolonged and difficult to control. Status epilepticus is common. For this reason, patients with seizures that do not respond immediately to anticonvulsants should be transferred as soon as possible to a trauma center and will generally require intensive care admission until seizures are controlled and neurologic status is improved.

Mean DDD level in women who aborted or delivered prematurely was 39.6 ppb. In full-term women it was 6.5 ppb. Mean level in placental tissue was 4.85 ppb in full-term women and 16.7 ppb in those with premature births or abortions. These highly significant differences indicate that organochlorine pesticides are involved in termination of pregnancy. Higher levels were correlated to earlier onset of abortion or premature labor. /Organochlorine pesticides/"

The present study aimed to investigate the association between organochlorine (OC) levels in maternal and cord serum, and the association between OC and thyroid hormone levels in cord serum. The study was performed with 39 mother-infant pairs from Mae Rim District of Chiang Mai Province, northern Thailand, who had normal delivery and full term gestation. Maternal blood was collected for measuring OCs and total lipids. Umbilical cord blood was collected for measuring OCs, total lipids, and thyroid hormones, including total thyroxine (TT(4)), free thyroxine (FT(4)), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE) had the highest level in all serum samples with a geometric mean of 1,191 ng/g lipids in maternal serum and 742 ng/g lipids in cord serum. The second highest level was that for 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT), followed by 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDD). Levels of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, and dieldrin in maternal serum were positively associated with levels in cord serum (r = 0.86, 0.77, 0.66, and 0.60, respectively; P<0.001). The important findings were that cord serum TT(4) levels were negatively associated with cord serum levels of p,p'-DDE (r = -0.37, P = 0.024), p,p'-DDT.3 (r = -0.33, P = 0.048), and 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (o,p'-DDE) (r = -0.76, P = 0.019). ...",

DDT, DDE, and DDD were each found to be pure phenobarbital-type cytochrome P450 inducers in the male F344/NCr rat, causing induction of hepatic CYP2B and CYP3A, but not CYP1A. The ED50 values for CYP2B induction (benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation) by DDT, DDE, and DDD were, respectively, 103, 88, and > or = 620 ppm in diet (14 days of exposure). The efficacies (Emax values) for induction of benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation by DDT, DDE, and DDD were 24-, 22-, and > or = 1-fold, respectively, compared to control values. The potencies of the three congeners for CYP2B induction appeared also to be similar, with EC50 values (based on total serum DDT equivalents) of 1.5, 1.8, and > or = 0.51 uM, respectively.",

Each cmpd was admin in the feed, at either of two concn, to groups of 50 male and 50 female animals of each species. Twenty animals of each species and sex were placed on test as controls for the bioassay of each cmpd. The time weighted avg high and low dietary concn of DDT were, respectively, 642 and 321 ppm for male rats, 420 and 210 ppm for female rats, 44 and 22 ppm for male mice, and 175 and 87 ppm for female mice. The time weighted avg high and low dietary concn of TDE were, respectively, 3294 and 1647 ppm for male rats, 1700 and 850 ppm for female rats, and 822 and 411 ppm for male and female mice. The time weighted avg high and low dietary concn of DDE were, respectively, 839 and 437 ppm for male rats, 462 and 242 ppm for female rats, and 261 and 148 ppm for male and female mice. After the 78 wk dosing period there was an additional observation period of up to 35 wk for rats and 15 wk for mice. ... Under the conditions of these bioassays there was no evidence for the carcinogenicity of DDT in Osborne-Mendel rats or B6C3F1 mice, of TDE in female Osborne-Mendel rats or B6C3F1 mice of either sex, or p,p'-DDE in Osborne-Mendel rats, although p,p'-DDE was hepatotoxic in Osborne-Mendel rats. The findings suggest a possible carcinogenic effect of TDE in male Osborne-Mendel rats, based on the induction of combined follicular cell carcinomas and follicular cell adenomas of the thyroid. Because of the variation of these tumors in control male rats in this study, the evidence does not permit a more conclusive interpretation of these lesions. p,p'-DDE was carcinogenic in B6C3F1 mice, causing hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: For p,p'-DDE: Male Rats: Negative, Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Positive; Female Mice: Positive. For DDT: Male Rats: Negative; Female Rats: Negative: Male Mice: Negative; Female Mice: Negative. For TDE: Male Rats: Equivocal; Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Negative; Female Mice: Negative.",

When the temp gradient was from 5 to 25 \u00b0C, the fish selected an area with a temp of 14.5 \u00b0C. Exposure to 20 to 30 ug/L of p,p' & o,p'-isomers of DDT & DDD, p,p'-methoxychlor, p,p'- bis(p-chlorophenyl)-acetic acid, & p,p'-Cl DDT led to the selection of a lower temp; p,p'-DDE & o,p'-DDE had only a small effect on the temp selected. The effect of prolonged exposure to the toxicants on temp selection by brook trout was also studied. ... Fish exposed to lower concn of DDT either did not choose a temp different from that of the controls or chose a lower temp; fish exposed to higher concn (20 to 60 ug/L) chose a temp higher than that of the controls; p,p'-DDD, methoxychlor, o,p'-DDT, & p,p'-DDE also induced a similar change, although the concn of the cmpd needed to produce the temp shift increased in the order indicated.",

DDD is a metabolite of DDT and the former use of DDT has also resulted in the direct release of DDD to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.35X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates DDD will exist solely in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase DDD will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.7 days. Particulate-phase DDD will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 100% of the original DDD in river water remained after 8 weeks in a sealed glass jar under sunlight and artificial fluorescent light. Therefore, direct photolysis is not expected to be an important fate pathway. If released to soil, DDD is expected to have no mobility based upon a Koc range of 130,600 to 131,800. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.60X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. DDD is persistant in aerobic soils and has a reported half-life of 160 days in anaerobic soil microcosms, indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, DDD is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Several studies found that no degradation of DDD was observed in an aqueous inoculum, indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 days and 79 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 134 years if adsorption is considered. Measured BCF values ranging from 2,710 to 51,000 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis half-lives range from 27 to 190 years in neutral and acidic waters, respectively, and is not expected to be an important fate process. Occupational exposure to DDD should be low or non-existent since DDD is no longer produced or used in the US (1972). However, due to its long persistence time, monitoring data indicate that the general population continues to be exposed to this compound via ingestion of contaminated food and drinking water, inhalation of contaminated air, and dermal contact with contaminated soil surfaces.

The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 134 years if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values ranging from of 2,710(8) to 51,000(9), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). 100% of the original DDD (initial concn = 10 ug/L) in river water remained after 8 weeks in a sealed glass jar under sunlight and artificial fluorescent light(8), indicating that DDD is not susceptible to direct photolysis in sunlight(SRC).

Vapor-phase DDD is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.4 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.3X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase DDD may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). 100% of the original DDD (initial concentration = 10 ug/L) in river water remained after 8 weeks in a sealed glass jar under sunlight and artificial fluorescent light(4), indicating that DDD is not susceptible to direct photolysis in sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

However, DDT and DDE were detected in muscle tissue at concns of 0.27 to 4.24 ng/g wet weight. Lake Mashu is located in a remote area with no major sources of pollutant emissions and is fed through the precipitation and permeation of groundwater through cracks(2).

The mean concns of DDD in cockles from Kuala Juru and Juala Selangor were 10.9 ng/g wet weight and 14.9 ng/g wet weight, respectively. In mussels, the mean concns of DDD were 15.1 ng/g wet weight and 9.6 ng/g wet weight in Sebatu and Sungai Danga, respectively(3). DDD was detected in mollusks (Simonovacula constricta) at 9.8 ng/g wet weight, taken from a sampling site in the Yangtze River, China in July 2002.

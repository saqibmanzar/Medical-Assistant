When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

All the test nitriles liberated cyanide both in vivo and in vitro, with the exception of benzonitrile, although the extent of liberation and the effect of carbon tetrachloride pretreatment on the mortality of animals differed among nitriles. From these results, test compounds were tentatively divided into 3 groups. In group 1, acute toxicity was greatly reduced by carbon tetrachloride pretreatment, in group 2, toxicity was not significantly changed or was somewhat enhanced, and in group 3, benzonitrile only, toxicity was clearly enhanced. The amount of cyanide was higher at death in the brains of mice given group 1 compounds, the level being comparable to that found in mice killed by dosing with potassium cyanide. The relation between log (1/LD50) and log p for the compounds in group 1 fitted a parabolic plot, while that for compounds in group 2 was linear. For most nitriles, the in vitro metabolism was inhibited when the incubation mixture contained either SKF-525A, carbon monoxide, or microsomes from mice treated with carbon tetrachloride. When mice were dosed with ethyl alcohol, metabolic enhancement of nitriles was seen compared with the control. However, ethyl alcohol, when added to the incubation mixture, inhibited the in vitro metabolism of nitriles. /Nitriles/",

Massive cyanide overdoses have survived with only good supportive care. Immediate attention should be directed toward assisted ventilation, administration of 100% oxygen, insertion of intravenous lines, and institution of cardiac monitoring. Obtain an arterial blood gas immediately and correct any severe metabolic acidosis (pH below 7.15). Oxygen (100%) should be used routinely in moderate or severely symptomatic patients even in the presence of a normal pO2, since 100% O2 increases O2 delivery, may reactivate cyanide-inhibited mitochondrial enzymes, and potentiates the effect of thiosulfate. Avoid mouth to mouth resuscitation during CPR in order to prevent self poisoning. /Cyanides/",

As a temporizing measure, the patient inhales the vapors until the sodium nitrite is ready. Because of the variability in methemoglobin production and the potential for cardiovascular collapse, this step may be omitted if sodium nitrite is readily available and the patient is not in extremis. Adequate ventilation and oxygenation are more important than administration of amyl nitrite. One perle (0.2 ml) is crushed and inhaled for 30 seconds every minute until iv nitrite is given. Sodium nitrite (3% solution), as 10 ml of a 3% solution (eg, 300 mg), is administered iv slowly over 4 minutes to produce a 20% methemoglobin level in adults. Children should receive 0.33 ml of the 3% solution per kilogram initially at an infusion rate of 2.5 ml/min, up to a maximum of 10 ml. Administer sodium nitrite doses to children on the basis of body weight, since fatal methemoglobinemia has occurred in children. /Cyanides/",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates glycolonitrile will exist solely as a vapor. Vapor-phase glycolonitrile will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 days. If released to soil, glycolonitrile is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Glycolonitrile is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, glycolonitrile is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 61 hrs and 30 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 0.5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to glycolonitrile may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where glycolonitrile is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

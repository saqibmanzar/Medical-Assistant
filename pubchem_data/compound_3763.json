Although the exact mechanism of action has not been established, inhaled isoflurane, appears to act on the lipid matrix of the neuronal cell membrane, which results in disruption of neuronal transmission. This agent enhances the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby increasing the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter on synaptic transmission. Isoflurane may also both inhibit glutamatergic excitatory transmission by increasing glutamate re-uptake, and potentiate glycine receptor activity, which decreases motor function. In addition, isoflurane may alter certain pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 and -10 (IL-6, IL-10), possibly through the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB) pathway, which may affect immune responses during surgery.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

We had an 11-year-old female patient suffering from status asthmaticus who was moribund from severe CO2 narcosis and was not responding to any of the conventional therapies. She finally fell into ventricular fibrillation. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation, we administered 2.0% isoflurane in oxygen. Within half an hour, her high inspiratory pressure was dramatically decreased, and then the isoflurane concentration was maintained at 1.0%. After 14 hours of isoflurane anesthesia, PaCO2 decreased to the normal level and the isoflurane treatment was discontinued. The endotracheal tube was removed 4 hours later. She had an uneventful recovery and was discharged from the hospital 11 days later. With its low metabolic rate and therefore low organ toxicity, as well as its low arrhythmogenicity with remarkable bronchodilating activity, we feel isoflurane may well be superior to other inhalation anesthetics in the treatment of status asthmaticus.",

(It should also be noted that many of these nonspecific signs may appear with light anesthesia, acute hypoxia, etc.) An increase in overall metabolism may be reflected in an elevated temperature, (which may rise rapidly early or late in the case, but usually is not the first sign of augmented metabolism) and an increased usage of the CO2 absorption system (hot canister). PaO2 and pH may decrease, and hyperkalemia and a base deficit may appear.",

Metabolism also contributes significantly to the elimination pharmacokinetics of some volatile agents. Although innumerable studies have explored anesthetic metabolism in animals, there is little information on human volatile anesthetic metabolism with respect to comparative rates or the identity of the enzymes responsible for defluorination. The first purpose of this investigation was to compare the metabolism of the fluorinated ether anesthetics by human liver microsomes. The second purpose was to test the hypothesis that cytochrome P450 2E1 is the specific P450 isoform responsible for volatile anesthetic defluorination in humans. Microsomes were prepared from human livers. Anesthetic metabolism in microsomal incubations was measured by fluoride production. The strategy for evaluating the role of P450 2E1 in anesthetic defluorination involved three approaches: for a series of 12 human livers, correlation of microsomal defluorination rate with microsomal P450 2E1 content (measured by Western blot analysis), correlation of defluorination rate with microsomal P450 2E1 catalytic activity using marker substrates (para-nitrophenol hydroxylation and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation), and chemical inhibition by P450 isoform-selective inhibitors. The rank order of anesthetic metabolism, assessed by fluoride production at saturating substrate concentrations, was methoxyflurane > sevoflurane > enflurane > isoflurane > desflurane > 0. There was a significant linear correlation of sevoflurane and methoxyflurane defluorination with antigenic P450 2E1 content (r = 0.98 and r = 0.72, respectively), but not with either P450 1A2 or P450 3A3/4. Comparison of anesthetic defluorination with either para-nitrophenol or chlorzoxazone hydroxylation showed a significant correlation for sevoflurane (r = 0.93, r = 0.95) and methoxyflurane (r = 0.78, r = 0.66). Sevoflurane defluorination was also highly correlated with that of enflurane (r = 0.93), which is known to be metabolized by human P450 2E1. Diethyldithiocarbamate, a selective inhibitor of P450 2E1, produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of sevoflurane, methoxyflurane, and isoflurane defluorination. No other isoform-selective inhibitor diminished the defluorination of sevoflurane, whereas methoxyflurane defluorination was inhibited by the selective P450 inhibitors furafylline (P450 1A2), sulfaphenazole (P450 2C9/10), and quinidine (P450 2D6) but to a much lesser extent than by diethyldithiocarbamate. These results demonstrate that cytochrome P450 2E1 is the principal, if not sole human liver microsomal enzyme catalyzing the defluorination of sevoflurane. P450 2E1 is the principal, but not exclusive enzyme responsible for the metabolism of methoxyflurane, which also appears to be catalyzed by P450s 1A2, 2C9/10, and 2D6. The data also suggest that P450 2E1 is responsible for a significant fraction of isoflurane metabolism. Identification of P450 2E1 as the major anesthetic metabolizing enzyme in humans provides a mechanistic understanding of clinical fluorinated ether anesthetic metabolism and toxicity.",

Metabolism also contributes significantly to the elimination pharmacokinetics of some volatile agents. Although innumerable studies have explored anesthetic metabolism in animals, there is little information on human volatile anesthetic metabolism with respect to comparative rates or the identity of the enzymes responsible for defluorination. The first purpose of this investigation was to compare the metabolism of the fluorinated ether anesthetics by human liver microsomes. The second purpose was to test the hypothesis that cytochrome P450 2E1 is the specific P450 isoform responsible for volatile anesthetic defluorination in humans. Microsomes were prepared from human livers. Anesthetic metabolism in microsomal incubations was measured by fluoride production. The strategy for evaluating the role of P450 2E1 in anesthetic defluorination involved three approaches: for a series of 12 human livers, correlation of microsomal defluorination rate with microsomal P450 2E1 content (measured by Western blot analysis), correlation of defluorination rate with microsomal P450 2E1 catalytic activity using marker substrates (para-nitrophenol hydroxylation and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation), and chemical inhibition by P450 isoform-selective inhibitors. The rank order of anesthetic metabolism, assessed by fluoride production at saturating substrate concentrations, was methoxyflurane > sevoflurane > enflurane > isoflurane > desflurane > 0. There was a significant linear correlation of sevoflurane and methoxyflurane defluorination with antigenic P450 2E1 content (r = 0.98 and r = 0.72, respectively), but not with either P450 1A2 or P450 3A3/4. Comparison of anesthetic defluorination with either para-nitrophenol or chlorzoxazone hydroxylation showed a significant correlation for sevoflurane (r = 0.93, r = 0.95) and methoxyflurane (r = 0.78, r = 0.66). Sevoflurane defluorination was also highly correlated with that of enflurane (r = 0.93), which is known to be metabolized by human P450 2E1. Diethyldithiocarbamate, a selective inhibitor of P450 2E1, produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of sevoflurane, methoxyflurane, and isoflurane defluorination. No other isoform-selective inhibitor diminished the defluorination of sevoflurane, whereas methoxyflurane defluorination was inhibited by the selective P450 inhibitors furafylline (P450 1A2), sulfaphenazole (P450 2C9/10), and quinidine (P450 2D6) but to a much lesser extent than by diethyldithiocarbamate. These results demonstrate that cytochrome P450 2E1 is the principal, if not sole human liver microsomal enzyme catalyzing the defluorination of sevoflurane. P450 2E1 is the principal, but not exclusive enzyme responsible for the metabolism of methoxyflurane, which also appears to be catalyzed by P450s 1A2, 2C9/10, and 2D6. The data also suggest that P450 2E1 is responsible for a significant fraction of isoflurane metabolism. Identification of P450 2E1 as the major anesthetic metabolizing enzyme in humans provides a mechanistic understanding of clinical fluorinated ether anesthetic metabolism and toxicity.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Appearance of ALT levels above 10 times the upper limit of normal, however, is distinctly unusual and points to significant hepatotoxicity. Clinically apparent, severe hepatic injury from isoflurane is very rare, only isolated case reports and small case series having been published. The injury is marked by acute elevations in serum aminotransferase levels (5- to 50-fold) and appearance of jaundice within 2 to 21 days of surgery. There are usually minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase levels. Jaundice is usually preceded by a day or two of fever and may be accompanied by rash and eosinophilia. The acute liver injury may be self-limited and resolve within 4 to 8 weeks, but can be severe and associated with acute liver failure. A strong risk factor is previous exposure to any of the halogenated anesthetics and particularly a history of halothane hepatitis or unexplained fever and rash after anesthesia with one of these agents. The differential diagnosis of acute liver injury after surgery and anesthesia is sometimes difficult, and a clinical picture similar to isoflurane hepatitis can be caused by shock or ischemia, other idiosyncratic forms of drug induced liver injury and acute viral or herpes hepatitis.",

Because the serum half-life of isoflurane in the mother is short and the drug is not expected to be absorbed by the infant, no waiting period or discarding of milk is required. Breastfeeding can be resumed as soon as the mother has recovered sufficiently from general anesthesia to nurse. When a combination of anesthetic agents is used for a procedure, follow the recommendations for the most problematic medication used during the procedure. In one study, breastfeeding before general anesthesia induction reduced requirements of sevoflurane and propofol compared to those of nursing mothers whose breastfeeding was withheld or nonnursing women. It is possible that requirements for other anesthetic agents would be affected similarly.",

However, no data currently exist concerning potential interactions between toxic levels of cocaine and volatile anesthetic agents. This study investigated the effects of cocaine infusion on systemic hemodynamics, myocardial metabolism, and regional organ blood flow in relation to depth of isoflurane anesthesia. Prospective, randomized, controlled trial /was conducted in/ twelve miniature pigs. An open-chest swine model was used. Isoflurane (ISO) was the sole anesthetic, administered at 0.75 and 1.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), and cocaine was infused (n = 6) at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min. Control animals (n = 6) received an equivalent amount of normal saline. Systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures and thermodilution cardiac output data were collected at 0.75 MAC and 1.5 MAC ISC. Regional myocardial and blood flows to other organs were measured using radiolabeled microspheres. Arrhythmias and altered ventricular conduction were noted only in the cocaine group, along with significant elevations in diastolic arterial pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and systemic vascular resistance. Increased subendocardial blood flow occurred during cocaine infusion (p = 0.03); subepicardial perfusion was unchanged. Cerebral (p < 0.01) and spinal cord (p < 0.05) blood flows were reduced in animals receiving cocaine. Other organ blood flows were unchanged with depth of anesthesia or cocaine administration, with the exception of splenic blood flow (p < 0.04). Moderately toxic cocaine levels occurring during isoflurane at 0.75 MAC and 1.5 MAC are associated with hemodynamic abnormalities, a marked increase in systemic vascular resistance, and a tendency to produce cardiac arrhythmias. A reversal of endo/epicardial myocardial perfusion ratio occurs associated with cocaine infusion during ISO anesthesia. This is probably not related to a primary redistribution of subendocardial blood flow and may be related to a combination of increased myocardial oxygen demand and epicardial coronary vasoconstriction. The reductions in cerebral and spinal cord perfusion observed may explain, in part, the neurologic sequelae of cocaine toxicity.",

However, the effect of isoflurane on NMDA receptor-mediated toxicity in vivo is not known. We conducted the present study to evaluate the effect of isoflurane on injury produced by cortical injection of NMDA in vivo and to compare it with dizocilpine, an antagonist of the NMDA receptor. Fasted Wistar-Kyoto rats were anesthetized with isoflurane. NMDA 50 nmoles (5-uL volume) were stereotactically injected into the cortex (2.8 mm lateral and 2.8 mm rostral to the bregma, depth 2 mm) of animals in one of four groups. In the isoflurane groups, the end-tidal concentration of isoflurane was maintained at either electroencephalogram (EEG)-burst suppression (BS) doses (2.2%-2.3%, n = 12) or a 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) dose (n = 10). In the dizocilpine group (n = 10), 10 mg/kg dizocilpine was injected IV 15 min before the NMDA injection. In the awake group and the dizocilpine group, anesthesia was discontinued on completion of the NMDA injection, and the animals were allowed to awaken. In the animals in the control group (n = 10), 20 uL of artificial cerebrospinal fluid was injected into the cortex. Injury to the cortex was evaluated 2 days after the NMDA injection. In 1 MAC doses and EEG-BS doses, isoflurane reduced the injury produced by a cortical NMDA injection compared with the awake state (1.74+/-0.49 and 0.96+/-0.46 vs 2.34+/-0.56 cu mm; P = 0.02). Dizocilpine reduced cortical injury (0.56+/-0.27; P = 0.01) compared with the awake state. Injury in the control group was limited to the trauma produced by cannula insertion. In the isoflurane EEG-BS and dizocilpine groups, the injury was not different from the control group. Isoflurane can reduce N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated cortical injury in vivo in a dose-dependent manner.

Inhalation anesthetics have long been considered to protect against neurotoxicity. However, recent research studies have suggested that the inhalation anesthetic isoflurane may promote neurotoxicity by inducing apoptosis and increasing Ab levels. We therefore set out to determine whether isoflurane can induce dose- and time-dependent dual effects on Ab-induced apoptosis: protection versus promotion. H4 human neuroglioma cells, primary neurons from naive mice, and naive mice were treated with Ab and/or isoflurane, and levels of caspase-3 cleavage (activation), apoptosis, Bcl-2, Bax, and cytosolic calcium were determined...the treatment with 2% isoflurane for six hours or 30 minutes potentiated, whereas the treatment with 0.5% isoflurane for six hours or 30 minutes attenuated, the Ab-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, anesthesia with 1.4% isoflurane for two hours potentiated, whereas the anesthesia with 0.7% isoflurane for 30 minutes attenuated, the Ab-induced caspase-3 activation in vivo. The high concentration isoflurane potentiated the Ab-induced reduction in Bcl-2/Bax ratio and caused a robust elevation of cytosolic calcium levels. The low concentration isoflurane attenuated the Ab-induced reduction in Bcl-2/Bax ratio and caused only a mild elevation of cytosolic calcium levels. These results suggest that isoflurane may have dual effects (protection or promotion) on Ab-induced toxicity, which potentially act through the Bcl-2 family proteins and cytosolic calcium. These findings would lead to more systematic studies to determine the potential dual effects of anesthetics on AD-associated neurotoxicity.",

All patients had rapid sequence induction of anesthesia with sodium thiamylal 4 mg/kg followed by succinylcholine for tracheal intubation. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups of 20 each (inspired 0.5% isoflurane, 1% isoflurane or 0.5% halothane), combined with 50% N2O and O2. After delivery, 67% N2O in O2 was used, supplemented by butorphanol. Maternal blood loss did not differ significantly among the three groups and none of the patients developed intraoperative awareness. At the time of delivery, maternal plasma epinephrine levels were significantly above preinduction levels in the 0.5% isoflurane group but unchanged in the other two groups. Neonatal status as ascertained by Apgar scores, cord acid base status and the Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scores (NACS) was equally good in the three groups of patients. Serum inorganic fluoride concentrations in the mother after anesthesia were not significantly above preanesthetic levels in any of the groups and there was no biochemical evidence of renal toxicity. In all neonates fluoride ion concentrations in the first voided urine sample were less than 7 umol/L, a value well below that associated with nephrotoxicity. It is concluded that isoflurane is a safe supplement to N2O - O2 mixture for cesarean section and is a safer alternative to halothane in situations when patients receiving beta-adrenergic therapy require cesarean section since halothane might potentiate arrhythmias caused by beta adrenergic agonists.",

It has a low level of biotransformation, and low hepatic and renal toxicity. In clinical concentrations, it has minimal negative inotropic effect, causes a small reduction in systemic vascular resistance, and, rarely, can cause cardiac arrhythmias. The objective of this report was to present a case of severe hemodynamic instability in a patient with idiopathic scoliosis. Male patient, 13 years old, ASA physical status I, with no prior history of allergy to medications, scheduled for surgical repair of idiopathic scoliosis. After anesthetic induction with fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, and atracurium, 1% isoflurane with 100% oxygen was initiated for anesthesia maintenance. After five minutes, the patient presented severe hypotension (MAP = 26 mmHg) associated with sinus tachycardia (HR = 166 bpm) that did not respond to the administration of vasopressors and fluids. Lung and heart auscultation, pulse oxymetry, capnography, nasopharyngeal temperature, and arterial blood gases did not change. The patient was treated for anaphylaxis and the surgery was cancelled. The clear temporal relationship between the administration of isoflurane and the symptoms suggested the diagnosis of cardiovascular intolerance to inhalational isoflurane. Two weeks later, total intravenous anesthesia was administered without complications. There are no reports of severe hemodynamic instability caused by isoflurane in previously healthy individuals. Anaphylaxis, supraventricular tachycardia with hemodynamic consequences, and increased cardiac sensitivity to isoflurane are discussed as possible causes of the hemodynamic instability. Currently, there is evidence that isoflurane can interfere in the coupling-uncoupling system of myocardial contractility by reducing cytosolic Ca2+ and/or depressing the function of contractile proteins. The fundamental molecular mechanisms of this process remain to be elucidated. This report suggests that the administration of isoflurane was the cause of the hemodynamic changes; the patient probably developed an unusual cardiovascular sensitivity to the drug.",

The cells were exposed in vitro to either halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane) or isoflurane (1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) at concentrations 0.1-10 mM in DMSO. The anesthetics-induced DNA strand breaks as well as alkali-labile sites were measured as total comet length (i.e., increase of a DNA migration). Both analysed drugs were capable of increasing DNA migration in a dose-dependent manner. In experiments conducted at two different electrophoretic conditions (0. 56 and 0.78 V/cm), halothane was able to increase DNA migration to a higher extent than isoflurane. The comet assay detects DNA strand breaks induced directly by genotoxic agents as well as DNA degradation due to cell death. For this reason a contribution of toxicity in the observed effects was examined. We tested whether the exposed PBL were able to repair halothane- and isoflurane-induced DNA damage. The treated cells were incubated in a drug-free medium at 37 degrees C for 120 min to allow processing of the induced DNA damage. PBL exposed to isoflurane at 1 mM were able to complete repair within 60 min whereas for halothane a similar result was obtained at a concentration lower by one order of magnitude: the cells exposed to halothane at 1 mM removed the damage within 120 min only partly. We conclude that the increase of DNA migration induced in PBL by isoflurane at 1 mM and by halothane at 0.1 mM was not a result of cell death-associated DNA degradation but was caused by genotoxic action of the drugs. The DNA damage detected after the exposure to halothane at 1 mM was in part a result of DNA fragmentation due to cell death.",

Fifteen guinea pigs were used in the study. Five were treated with isoflurane in oxygen, five with oxygen and five were controls. Animals were exposed to isoflurane and oxygen three times. Each treatment was performed for 30 min once a day for three consecutive days. Activities of free radical enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px); values of antioxidant parameters, antioxidant potential (AOP), non-enzymatic superoxide radical scavenger activity (NSSA) and oxidation resistance (OR) and, level of an oxidant parameter namely, malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined in the renal tissues of the groups. Blood was also obtained for serum creatinine and urea analyses. AOP, NSSA, SOD and CAT activities were decreased; (0.0188 +/- 0.0026 vs 0.0156 +/- 0.0015, P < 0.025; 8.72 +/- 1.80 vs 6.40 +/- 1.22, P < 0.05; 76.71 +/- 18.54 vs 52.79 +/- 11.68, P < 0.025; 71.26 +/- 15.58 vs 55.39 +/- 8.83; P < 0.05, respectively) but, MDA level, OR value and GSH-Px activities increased (10.89 +/- 1.57 vs 15.87 +/- 2.97, P < 0.01; 0.84 +/- 0.34 vs 2.28 +/- 1.39, P < 0.05; 1.45 +/- 0.83 vs 3.45 +/- 1.20, P < 0.01, respectively) in kidney tissues from isoflurane-treated group compared with controls. No differences were observed between control and oxygen groups with regard to all analysis parameters except GSH-Px. Isoflurane impairs the antioxidant defence system and this oxidant stress may play a part in the isoflurane-induced renal toxicity.",

Recent reports suggest that VA interact with neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins including compounds with pathogenic relevance in Alzheimer disease (AD) and induce processes that may be linked to AD neuropathology. Unfortunately, our present understanding of the exact anesthetics' molecular mechanisms of action, their side effects on the brain, and their catenation with AD pathology is still limited. The present study analyzes the differential proteome of the hippocampus immediately after and 3 days after a 3-hour 1 minimal alveolar concentration isoflurane anesthesia in rats. Differential 2-dimensional electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and functional network mapping were used to identify and functionally classify 12 different hippocampal proteins, which were significantly regulated after isoflurane anesthesia (6 up-regulated, 11 down-regulated with P<0.01). Induction of differential expression ranged from 0.05 (25-fold down-regulation) to 4.4 (4.4-fold up-regulation). Ten proteins were regulated immediately after and 7 proteins 3 days after isoflurane exposure. The proteome displays isoflurane-responsive protein candidates, which have also been shown to play a role in AD. They were grouped according to their key biologic activities, which showed that isoflurane affects selected biologic processes including synaptic plasticity, stress response, detoxification, and cytoskeleton in early and late recovery phases after anesthesia. These processes are also affected in AD.",

Abundant experimental data characterize HO-1 as one of the most powerful inducible enzymes that contribute to the protection of the liver and other organs after harmful stimuli. Therapeutic strategies aimed at utilizing the protective effects of HO-1 are hampered by the fact that most pharmacological inducers of this enzyme perturb organ function by themselves and are not available for use in patients because of their toxicity and undesirable or unknown side effects. Rats were pretreated with isoflurane before induction of partial hepatic ischemia (1 hour) and reperfusion (1 hour). At the end of each experiment, blood and liver tissue were obtained for molecular biologic, histologic, and immunohistochemical analyses. Isoflurane pretreatment increased hepatic HO-1 mRNA, HO-1 protein, HO enzyme activity, and decreased plasma levels of AST, ALT, and alpha-GST. Histologic analysis of livers obtained from isoflurane-pretreated rats showed a reduction of necrotic areas, particularly in the perivenular region, the predominant site of isoflurane-induced HO-1 expression. In addition, sinusoidal congestion that could otherwise be observed after ischemia/reperfusion was inhibited by the anesthetic. Furthermore, isoflurane augmented hepatic microvascular blood flow and lowered the malondialdehyde content within the liver compared with control animals. Administration of tin protoporphyrin IX inhibited HO activity and abolished the isoflurane-induced protective effects.",

To test this possibility, its effects were compared with those of other volatile agents on hepatic, renal, and pulmonary specimens taken from enzyme-induced, hypoxic rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with phenobarbital and exposed for 1 hr to 12% O2 and no anesthesia (control) or to 1.2 minimum alveolar concentration of one of three anesthetics: I-653, isoflurane, or halothane. Liver, kidney, and lung specimens were taken 24 hr after exposure concluded. The livers of all rats given halothane (n = 6) had swelling (20.5 +/- 5.7% of a lobule [mean +/- SD]) and centrilobular necrosis (6.7 +/- 2.1% of a lobule). Isoflurane produced only slight injury (6.7 +/- 3.5% swelling and 1.0 +/- 0.0% necrosis in 3 of 15 rats). No hepatic injury occurred in control rats (n = 20) or in those given I-653 (n = 16).

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 330 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isoflurane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase isoflurane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 460 days. Isoflurane absorbs light at wavelengths <200 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isoflurane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 94. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.87X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Isoflurane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, isoflurane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to isoflurane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isoflurane is produced or used. Exposure to isoflurane among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug, an anaesthetic. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.87X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The short-term exposure (also called acute exposure) is a short contact with a chemical. It may last a few seconds or a few hours. For example, it might take a few minutes to clean windows with ammonia, use nail polish remover or spray a can of paint. The fumes someone might inhale during these activities are examples of acute exposures.",

In most cases, the symptoms presented were immediate vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, and abdominal pain, which resolved after traditional treatment methods such as gastric lavage, delivery of activated charcoal, and administration of atropine.

Blasticidin-S is producted by the fermentation of Streptomyces griseochromogenes. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.8X10-16 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates blasticidin-S will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase blasticidin-S will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, blasticidin-S is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,500. Blasticidin-S has pKa1, pKa2, pKa3, and pKa4 of 2.4 (carboxylic acid), 4.6, 8.0, and >12.5 (amino groups), respectively, indicating that this compound will primarily exist with an overall positive charge in the environment, and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-34 atm-cu m/mole and blasticidin-S's ionic character. Half-lives in two soil types with organic content of 2.53 and 9.6% and moisture of 42.6 and 87%, respectively, at pH 6.0 and 25 \u00b0C were <2 days. If released into water, blasticidin-S is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Based on the pKa's of blasticidin-S, this compound will exist almost entirely with an overall positive charge at pH values of 5 to 9, and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3.1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Blasticidin-S does not absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm in aqueous solution at acidic or basic conditions, and, therefore, direct photolysis by sunlight would not be expected. Occupational exposure to blasticidin-S may have occurred through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where blasticidin-S was produced or used. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since blasticidin-S is no longer produced or used in the US. (SRC)",

Blasticidin-S has pKa1, pKa2, pKa3, and pKa4 of 2.4 (carboxylic acid), 4.6, 8.0, and >12.5 (amino groups), respectively(3), indicating that this compound will primarily exist with an overall positive charge in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts(4). Since this compound is expected to exist with an overall positive charge in the environment, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3.1(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -4.68(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

If released to the atmosphere, 4-chloro-o-toluidine will degrade in the vapor-phase by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of 9 hours); it may also undergo direct photolysis. 4-Chloro-o-toluidine released to soil should have moderate mobility with an estimated Koc of 410. The presence of humus or organic matter in the soil may cause strong binding to soil however, due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group. Photolysis of 4-chloro-o-toluidine on soil surfaces may occur. Biodegradation of 4-chloro-o-toluidine is possible with 20% mineralization of this compound over 6 weeks reported in a soil system. Biologically mediated polymerizing transformations of 4-chloro-o-toluidine may also occur in soil. Volatilization of 4-chloro-o-toluidine from water surfaces will be slow based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Strong sorption to organic materials in the water column may be expected for some portion of 4-chloro-o-toluidine released to water. Bioconcentration of 4-chloro-o-toluidine in aquatic organisms is not a major fate process. Limited biodegradation data suggest that biodegradation of 4-chloro-o-toluidine in water will be slow. 7% removal of TOC from an industrial wastewater was reported; however GC analysis showed that more extensive degradation of the parent compound occurred. Exposure to 4-chloro-o-toluidine may occur occupationally during production and use of this compound and may also result from exposure to pesticides which form this compound as metabolite. (SRC)",

In an experimental soil system, however, it was shown that a considerable portion, about 50%, of this compound bound very strongly to the soil medium and that this was possibly due to interactions between the aromatic amine and humic/organic materials in the soil(4,5); soils with very little organic matter may not bind 4-chloro-o-toluidine strongly(5,SRC). Biodegradation of 4-chloro-o-toluidine may occur and may be a major fate process of this compound in soil; 20% mineralization of 4-chloro-o-toluidine in soil was reported over a 6 week time period(6). A polymerizing transformation of 4-chloro-o-toluidine to the corresponding azobenzene was shown in the presence of pure enzymes derived from a soil fungus(7).",

Volatilization of 4-chloro-o-toluidine from water surfaces will be slow based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(3,SRC). Sorption of this compound to organic material in the water column may be a significant fate process; soil with added 4-chloro-o-toluidine retained about 50% of this compound as a strongly bound residue following Soxhlet extraction(4,5). Interaction of the aromatic amine with organic matter in the soil was believed to be responsible for this binding(4,5). Biodegradation of this compound in water may be possible; from an industrial wastewater 7% removal of TOC was seen but with GC analysis, structural changes to this compound were also detected resulting in higher levels of measured biodegradation of the parent compound(6). Bioconcentration of 4-chloro-o-toluidine in aquatic organisms is not an important fate process(7).",

Evolution of CO2 from the ring-labelled compound gives evidence for biologically mediated ring cleavage. Autoclaved soil control samples with added 4-chloro-o-toluidine did not produce CO2(1). Incubation of 4-chloro-o-toluidine with aniline oxidase or L-3 peroxidase obtained from the soil fungus Geotrichum candidum resulted in the formation of 2,2'-dimethyl-4,4'dichloroazobenzene through polymerizing transformations of the original compound(2). 4-Chloro-o-toluidine from a petrochemical industrial process wastewater at an initial concentration of 110 mg/l with activated sludge as an inoculum and a one day acclimation period gave 16% removal by measuring COD(Mn) and 7% removal of TOC after a 24 hour period under aerobic conditions(3). This compound was considered to be non-biodegradable using this test(3). Gas chromatography however, used to measure biodegradation during this same 24 hour period, showed better degradability of 4-chloro-o-toluidine suggesting that structural breakdown of this compound occurs prior to oxidation of carbon into carbon dioxide(3). 0% biodegradation of 4-chloro-o-toluidine was shown via BOD in a 2 week experiment using activated sludge as an inoculum and with 4-chloro-o-toluidine present at 100 mg/ml(4).",

A pronounced change in the UV-visible absorption spectrum occurred with the intense absorption throughout the visible region indicative of the formation of numerous decomposition products(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 4-chloro-o-toluidine with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated as 41.4X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C which corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 9 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2,SRC). An experimental pKa of 3.85 was measured for 4-chloro-o-toluidine(3). For most environmental pH conditions 4-chloro-o-toluidine will exist in the dissociated form(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a suggested classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 4-chloro-o-toluidine has moderate mobility in soil(SRC). 14C labelled 4-chloro-o-toluidine was added to autoclaved soil (pH 7.5, and organic matter, sand, silt, and clay contents of 3.4, 36.6, 28.2, and 35.2%, respectively) and incubated for several weeks; 12.2% of the radioactive label was removed as volatiles, 25% was recovered in a Soxhlet extract, and 55.1% of the radioactive label was obtained after Soxhlet extraction using Bleidner distillation (bound residue fraction)(4). This suggests that a significant portion of the 4-chloro-o-toluidine is bound strongly by this soil(4). Over a 24 hour time period, 34% of applied 4-chloro-o-toluidine was found in the bound residue fraction(5). Binding due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group to humus or soil organic matter rather than to clay particles is proposed as a reason for the soil binding ability of anilines(4,5). Low adsorption is observed at a neutral pH with pure clay minerals or soils for substituted anilines(5).",

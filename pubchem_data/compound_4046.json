The 2020 World Health Organization malaria report indicates a 60% decrease in the global malaria fatality rate between 2000 to 2019. Despite this, malaria remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; 90% of deaths from malaria occur in Africa. Individuals at the highest risk for malaria are those in disease na\u00efve populations, children under age 5, refugees in Central and Eastern Africa, nonimmune civilian and military travelers, pregnant women, and immigrants traveling to their place of origin.  Mefloquine, commonly known as Lariam, is an antimalarial drug used for the prevention and treatment of malaria caused by infection with Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. The drug was initially discovered by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) during a malaria drug discovery program between 1963 until 1976. It was approved by the FDA in 1989, and was first marketed by Hoffman Laroche. This drug has been the subject of widespread controversy due to concerns regarding neurotoxic effects; product information warns of potential serious neuropsychiatric effects.",

Although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, mefloquine, a weak base, preferentially accumulates in lysosomes and disrupts lysosomal function and integrity, thereby leading to host cell death. Similar to chloroquine, the chemosensitizing and radiosensitizing activities of this agent may be related to its inhibition of autophagocytosis, a cellular mechanism involving lysosomal degradation that minimizes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) related to tumor reoxygenation and tumor exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. Compared to chloroquine, mefloquine has better blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetration.",

Note: Patients with acute P. vivax malaria, treated with mefloquine, are at high risk of relapse because mefloquine does not eliminate exoerythrocytic (hepatic phase) parasites. To avoid relapse, after initial treatment of the acute infection with mefloquine, patients should subsequently be treated with an 8-aminoquinoline derivative (e.g., primaquine). /Included in the US product label/",

One wk before taking the last scheduled dose of mefloquine, the patient developed headaches and myalgia, followed in 8 days by fever; after blood smears revealed Plasmodium falciparum, quinine and tetracycline were taken orally and the fever resolved within 48 hr. It was concluded that subinhibitory levels and prophylaxis failure may occasionally occur when mefloquine is used as currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, and patients who are exposed to mosquitoes for relatively long periods of time may require further consideration.",

Antimalarial Combination Therapies ( ACTs) are the recommended treatments for uncomplicated falciparum malaria.  ... The following ACTs are currently recommended: artemether plus lumefantrine, artesunate plus amodiaquine, artesunate plus mefloquine, artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and dihydrortemisinin plus piperaquine. Fixed-dose combinations are highly preferable to the loose individual medicines co-blistered or co-dispensed. The choice of ACT in a country or region will be based on the level of resistance of the partner medicine in the combination: in areas of multidrug resistance (east Asia), artesunate plus mefloquine, or artemether plus lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine are recommended; and in other areas without multidrug resistance (mainly Africa), any of the ACTs including those containing amodiaquine or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine may still be effective.",

Many of these workers are based abroad either on shore or on oil installations off the West and Central coasts of Africa. Review of malaria admissions to the regional infection unit in Aberdeen, Scotland showed that 69% of all patients with malaria were British residents, and of these 46% had acquired the infection while on business related to the oil industry in West or Central Africa. Workers stationed in the African countries usually have a 4 wk period off shore and 4 wk on shore, the latter frequently being spent in the United Kingdom. Few of these individuals take proper preventive measures to avoid spreading the disease. The use of oral prophylactic treatment involves daily medication from which some individuals have experienced nausea and oral ulceration occurring over the long haul. The author calls for a change in the work practices in this region of the world. Pretravel counseling of these employees is necessary with emphasis placed on reducing transmission by use of mosquito repellants or insecticide impregnated bed nets. The concern over neuropsychiatric side effects of mefloquine has restricted its use in the UK.",

Dizziness has been reported in about 40% of children receiving mefloquine for the treatment of acute malaria. Other adverse nervous system effects include abnormal dreams, altered consciousness, forgetfulness, motor and sensory neuropathy, and vertigo.",

Similar to chloroquine and quinine, mefloquine appears to interfere with the parasite's ability to metabolize and utilize erythrocyte hemoglobin. The antimalarial activity of mefloquine may depend on the ability of the drug to form hydrogen bonds with cellular constituents; results of structure-activity studies indicate that the orientation of the hydroxyl and amine groups with respect to each other in the mefloquine molecule may be essential for antimalarial activity. While the precise mechanism of action of mefloquine is unknown, it may involve mechanisms that differ from those proposed for chloroquine.",

These effects of mefloquine are in contrast to its actions on Ca2+ uptake and release by skeletal muscle microsomes, where its predominant effect was seen to be the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into the vesicles. Mefloquine was found to be more potent than quinine as a specific inhibitor of Ca2+ release from IP3-sensitive stores in dog brain microsomes.

A review of the treatment of malaria is presented, including the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action, resistance, and toxicity of quinine, quinidine, chloroquine, amodiaquine, pyrimethamine, sulfonamides, mefloquine, sesquiterpene lactones, tetracyclines, and primaquine. The distribution of malaria and patterns of resistance are examined and the therapy of chloroquine resistant malaria in particular is considered. Adult and pediatric dosage schedules of commonly used agents for the treatment of chloroquine resistant malaria are listed. Management of complications of infection with severe malaria is also discussed.",

Mefloquine is an antimalarial agent which acts as a blood schizonticide. It is used for the prevention and treatment of malaria caused by strains of Plasmodium falciparum or P. vivax. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Overdosage of mefloquine produces manifestations that are similar to the adverse reactions reported with the drug. Vertigo, hallucinations, dizziness, nausea, hypotension, tachycardia, and seizures occurred in 2 patients who ingested an overdosage of mefloquine (up to 5250 mg over 5 days). Since seizures may also occur at therapeutic doses, mefloquine is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures. Mefloquine has also been associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations: anxiety, paranoia, depression, hallucinations and psychotic behavior. These manifestations may continue long after mefloquine has been discontinued. These neuropsychiatric effects have been reported both after overdose and at therapeutic doses. To minimize the chance of these adverse effects, use of mefloquine for prophylaxis is contraindicated in patients with active depression, a recent history of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia or other major psychiatric disorders. There is also evidence that the use of halofantrine during mefloqune therapy and within 15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine increases the risk of a potential fatal prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc). This risk may also be increased following co-administration with ketoconazole. Clinically significant QTc interval prolongation has not been reported with mefloquine monotherapy. Several studies in pregnant women have shown no increase in the risk of teratogenic effects or adverse pregnancy outcomes following mefloquine treatment or prophylaxis during pregnancy. The WHO concluded however, that treatment with mefloquine should be undertaken cautiously during the first 12-14 weeks of gestation. ANIMAL STUDIES: While two year studies in mice and rats failed to show an increase in tumors, mefloquine did produce toxic effects.  In one such study, rats were administered mefloquine in the diet at 0, 5, 12.5 or 30 mg/kg/day for 2 years. In the high dose group the weight gain of both sexes was significantly depressed and the incidence of spontaneous death was increased. Males had decreased testicle size and paralysis of hind limbs, while females showed increased vaginal hemorrhage, cystic ovaries and distended uteri filled with fluid. Elevated liver enzymes and blood urea nitrogen levels occurred for both sexes. At study completion, both sexes showed lesions in eye, lung, kidney, reproductive organs, skeletal muscle, spleen and lymph node. Retinal degeneration, opacity of the lens and/or retinal edema occurred at both the mid and high dose group. (Severity was greater in females).  Mild lesions of reproductive organs and bile duct hyperplasia were seen in the mid dose group. Males had lesions in the epididymis and prostate; epithelial vacuolization of epididymis, foamy macrophages in lungs and skeletal muscle degeneration were observed in both sexes of the low dose group. The potential for mefloquine to cause neurological effects were investigated in 7-week-old female rats given a single oral dose of the drug. Potential mefloquine-induced neurological effects were monitored using a standard functional observational battery, automated open field tests, automated spontaneous activity monitoring, a beam traverse task, and histopathology. Mefloquine induced dose-related changes in endpoints associated with spontaneous activity and impairment of motor function and caused degeneration of specific brain stem nuclei (nucleus gracilis). Increased spontaneous motor activity was observed only during the rats' normal sleeping phase, suggesting a correlate to mefloquine-induced sleep disorders. Mefloquine was also shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats and rabbits. In one study, rats were administered mefloquine at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day by intragastric intubation. In the high dose group, rats grew slower and consumed less feed than controls. Fetuses had reduced body weight, reduced crown-rump length, increased incidence of externally visible soft tissue and skeletal defects; domes craniums occurred at a high rate, high incidence of hydrocephalus; malformed interparietals, incompletely ossified supra occipitals, and incompletely ossified skull bones were also  observed. In a similar study in the mouse, mefloquine at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg/day resulted in decreased body weight and a high incidence of cleft palate in fetuses. Mefloquine was also shown to impair fertility in both male and female rats. Mefloquine was not found to be mutagenic in the following tests: Ames Test, Fluctuation Test, Host (Mouse) Mediated Assay, Micronucleus Test, Induction of Point Mutations, Yeast Treat and Plate Test.",

Lengthening of the QTc and severe cardiac arrhythmia have been observed ... The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate whether antimalarial agents alter dispersion of the QTc and ventricular repolarization dynamicity. Sixty patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomly allocated in four groups of 15 patients and treated with quinine, mefloquine, artemether, or halofantrine at recommended doses. Patients in treatment groups were compared with a group including 15 healthy controls with no history of malaria and/or febrile illness within the last month. QTc dispersion was measured on surface electrocardiograms. Repolarization dynamicity was analyzed from Holter recordings, which allow automatic beat-to-beat measurement of QT and RR intervals. Plasma drug concentration was determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. No change in QTc dispersion was observed after treatment with quinine, mefloquine, or artemether. ...  Mefloquine and artemether did not alter ventricular repolarization. Quinine induced a significant decrease in QT/RR slope of the same order of magnitude as those previously observed with quinidine. ...",

The relationship between mefloquine antimalarial treatment and the outcome of pregnancy in Karen women living in an area along the western border of Thailand where multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum infections are common /was investigated/. Of 3,587 pregnancies investigated, 208 (5.8%) were exposed to mefloquine, 656 (18.3%) to quinine only, and 909 (25.3%) to other antimalarials, and 2,470 (68.9%) had no documented malaria. There were 61 stillbirths and 313 abortions. Women who received mefloquine treatment during but not before pregnancy had a significantly greater risk of stillbirth than did women treated with quinine alone (odds ratio [OR], 4.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-12.7), women exposed to other treatments (OR, 5.10; 95% CI, 2-13.1), and women who had no malaria (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.6-7.6) (P < .01). This association remained after adjustment for all identified confounding factors. Mefloquine was not associated with abortion, low birth weight, neurological retardation, or congenital malformations. Mefloquine treatment during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of stillbirth.",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

An arsenate (compound) is any compound that contains this ion.The arsenic atom in arsenate has a valency of 5 and is also known as pentavalent arsenic or As[V].Arsenate resembles phosphate in many respects, since arsenic and phosphorus occur in the same group (column) of the periodic table. In acidic conditions arsenate exists as arsenic acid, H3AsO4;in weakly acid conditions it exists as dihydrogen arsenate ion, H2AsO4&#8722;; in weakly basic conditions it exists as hydrogen arsenate ion HAsO42&#8722;; and finally, in basic conditions, it exists as the arsenate ion AsO43&#8722. Arsenate can replace inorganic phosphate in the step of glycolysis that produces 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, yielding 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate instead. This molecule is unstable and quickly hydrolyzes, forming the next intermediate in the pathway, 3-phosphoglycerate. Therefore glycolysis proceeds, but the ATP molecule that would be generated from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is lost - arsenate is an uncoupler of glycolysis, explaining its toxicity.[1]. Some species of bacteria obtain their energy by oxidizing various fuels while reducing arsenates to form arsenites. The enzymes involved are known as arsenate reductases. In 2008, bacteria were discovered that employ a version of photosynthesis with arsenites as electron donors, producing arsenates (just like ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor, producing molecular oxygen). The researchers conjectured that historically these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate-reducing bacteria to thrive. (Wikipedia). Arsenic acid is the chemical compound with the formula H3AsO4. More descriptively written as AsO(OH)3, this colorless acid is the arsenic analogue of phosphoric acid. Arsenate and phosphate salts behave very similarly. Arsenic acid as such has not been isolated, but only found in solution where it is largely ionized. Its hemihydrate form (H3AsO4_\u0430__H2O) does form stable crystals. Crystalline samples dehydrate with condensation at 100  C.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Pathway involves the formation of a monomethylated metabolite which is either rapidly further methylated into a dimethylated derivative or is spontaneously oxidized into monomethylarsonic acid. The dimethylated metabolite gives rise to dimethylarsinic acid. The first methylation reaction is rate limiting, can be stimulated by glutathione and is catalyzed by an enzyme different from that which transfers the second methyl group. The latter is sensitive to inhibition by inorganic arsenic. ... A large excess of thiol groups may prevent the methylation reactions probably by decreasing the amount of free trivalent arsenic.",

Metals which precipitate arsenic acid include magnesium, lead, calcium, and iron (III). Arsenate precipitation with ferric hydroxide has been suggested to reduce its phytotoxicity. Its precipitation will also reduce its potential for leaching. Arsenate could be suitably precipitated with a slight excess of lime, ferric hydroxide, or magnesium. The best procedure is to stir ferric chloride, or a hydroxide of ferric, calcium, or magnesium into the waste arsenic acid and allow the mixture to stand 24 hr. Then, the supernatant water should be siphoned or decanted. An alternate procedure would be to precipitate arsenic with sulfide. Since the method requires more sophisticated handling, the precipitation with heavy metals is preferred. The sulfide precipitation requires decreasing the soln acidity to < pH 1 with 6 N-HCL /6 N-hydrochloric acid/, then saturating the soln with sodium sulfide or hydrogen sulfide. The precipitate and supernatant should be handled just as described for the ferric or other metal arsenate precipitates. Empty containers should be triple rinsed. \"Triple rinse\" means the flushing of containers three times, each time using a volume of the normal diluent equal to approx ten percent of the container's capacity, and adding the rinse liquid to the spray mixture or disposing of it by a method prescribed for disposing of the pesticide. Although the precipitation of arsenic acid could reduce its mobility in the environment and its toxicity, insufficient environmental testing is available to verify this conclusion. The precipitates should be considered hazardous. Recommendable methods: Precipitation, solidification, landfill. Not recommendable methods: Thermal destruction, discharge to sewer.",

                                "Description": "The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical is an airborne concentration at which a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effect.  There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

                                "Description": "In general, the occupational exposure limit (OEL) indicates the level of admissible exposure, for a length of time (usually 8 hours), to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health of a worker. The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase. By competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17)",

When ganglia were treated with arsenic acid concn > 10-6M, pathological changes were detected. Prominent swelling of the Golgi apparatus and the appearance of small vesicles were the earliest ultrastructural changes. Next neuronal soma showed disarrangement and dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, large vesicles were observed. Satellite cells were the last part of the ganglia to deteriorate. Early changes in myelinated fibers were formation of densely packed neurofilaments and loss of microtubules. These were followed by splitting of myelin lamellae. Finally, many myelin ovoids and myelin debris were observed in Schwann cell cytoplasm.",

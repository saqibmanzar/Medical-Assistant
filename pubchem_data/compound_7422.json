Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

With a typical batch process, the toluene is fed into the nitrator and cooled to about 25 \u00b0C. The nitrating acid (52-56 wt% H2SO4, 28-32 wt% HNO3, and 12-20 wt% H2O) is added slowly below the surface of the toluene and the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 25 \u00b0C by adjusting the feed rate of the nitrating acid and the amount of cooling. After all of the acid is added, the temperature is raised slowly to 35-40 \u00b0C. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is put into a separator where the spent acid is withdrawn from the bottom and is reconcentrated. The crude product is washed in several steps with dilute caustic and then water. The product is steam distilled to remove excess toluene and then dried by distilling the remaining traces of water. The resulting product contains 55-60 wt% o-nitrotoluene, 3-4 wt% m-nitrotoluene, and 35-40 wt% p-nitrotoluene. The yield of mononitrotoluenes is about 96%. ... The separation of the isomers is carried out by a combination of fractional distillation and crystallization.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this yellow liquid may occur from its use as a chemical intermediate in the production of dyes, explosives, pesticides, toluidines, and nitrobenzoic acids. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, headache, weakness, dizziness, nausea, increased pulse and respiratory rate, and methemoglobinemia. The onset of symptoms may be delayed up to 4 hours. OSHA has set a time-weighted average (TWA) limit of 2 ppm as a final rule to become effective December 31, 1992. Local exhaust ventilation should be applied to control airborn e 3-nitrotoluene to permissible limits.  In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and chemical protective clothing which is specifically recommended by the shipper or manufacturer. If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash expose d skin thoroughly with soap and water.  Contaminated clothing and shoes should be removed and left at the site for cleaning.  While 3-nitrotoluene does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of irritating or poisonous gases. Also, containers of this substance may explode violently in the heat of a fire. For fires involving 3-nitrotoluene, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or standard foam.  Fight fire from as far a distance as possible, and, if fire is advanced, evacuate the area. Dike fire control water. 3-Nitrotoluene should be stored in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area, away from sources of ignition, sources of physical damage, strong oxidizers, and sulfuric acid. Dike to prevent land spills of 3-nitrotoluene from entering water sources or sewers, and take up by absorbing the material in vermiculite, dry sand, or earth. For spills of 3-nitrotoluene in bodies of water, use sand bag barriers to trap material at the bottom, apply activated carbon, and use mechanical dredg es or lifts to remove immobilized masses.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Livers were removed and analyzed for total and covalently bound radiolabel. Maximal concentrations of total radiolabel were observed between 3 and 12 hr after the dose, and there were no large differences among the 3 isomers in peak concentrations achieved. Covalent binding to hepatic macromolecules was maximal 12 hrs after administration for all 3 isomers. Thereafter, concentration of covalently bound 2-nitrotoluene derived material were always 2-6 times higher than those of 3- or 4-nitrotoluene derived material. When DNA was isolated from livers of rats given mononitrotoluene isomers 12 hrs previously, only 2-nitrotoluene was observed to covalently bind at concentration above the limits of detection of the assay. The covalent binding of 2-nitrotoluene, but not that of 3- or 4-nitrotoluene, to both total hepatic macromolecules and DNA was markedly decreased by prior administration of pentachlorophenol or 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol. Covalent binding to hepatic DNA was decreased by >96%. Thus, 2-nitrotoluene, but not 3- or 4-nitrotoluene, induces DNA excision repair. Furthermore, 2-nitrotoluene, like the hepatocarcinogen 2,6-dinitrotoluene, may require the action of sulfotransferase for its conversion to a species capable of covalently binding to hepatic DNA.",

The estimated daily doses based on measures of feed consumption were 40 to 900 mg nitrotoluene/kg body weight/day for rats ... and were similar for each of the 3 isomers when compared for each dietary level/sex/species. There were no effects on survival in any of the studies, and clinical signs of toxicity were limited to decreases in feed consumption. Decreased body weight gains occurred in dosed rats ... in all studies at the higher dose levels and were most pronounced in rats receiving o-nitrotoluene.  In rats, histopathologic analyses after 13 weeks of dosing showed toxicity to kidney, spleen, and testis in animals receiving any of the 3 isomers, and toxicity to the liver and mesothelium in male rats given o-nitrotoluene. Kidney toxicity observed in male rats was characterized by the presence of hyaline droplets in tubular epithelial cells, attributed to an increase in the level of a-2u globulin. Pigment, possibly lipofuscin, and karyomegaly in the p-nitrotoluene study were present in the renal tubular epithelium of dosed male and female rats. In the spleen of treated male and female rats, there was a mild increase in hematopoiesis, hemosiderin deposition, and/or congestion; this effect was most severe with the para-isomer, followed by the ortho- and then the meta-isomer. Administration of o-, m-, or p-nitrotoluene impaired testicular function of the rat, shown by degeneration of the testis and reduction in sperm concentration, motility, and spermatid number. All 3 isomers increased the length of the estrous cycle in rats. Hepatic toxicity was characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization and oval cell hyperplasia and by an increase in the level of serum bile acids, SDH, and ALT activities in male rats given o-nitrotoluene. There was no histopathologic evidence for liver toxicity in male or female rats with the m- or p-isomers, or in female rats with the o-isomer; but evidence of liver injury was observed in these groups, indicated by increases in relative liver weights and elevations in bile acids and liver enzymes in serum. Mesotheliomas of the tunica vaginalis were observed in 3/10 male rats receiving o-nitrotoluene at 5000 ppm, and mesothelial cell hyperplasia was observed in 2/10 male rats receiving o-nitrotoluene at 10000 ppm.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.107 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-nitrotoluene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-nitrotoluene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 days. 3-Nitrotoluene is also expected to undergo direct photolysis, with 3-methyl-2-nitrophenol, 3-methyl-6-nitrophenol, and 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol being its primary photoproducts. If released to soil, 3-nitrotoluene is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 363. Field monitoring at a munition factory site found that 3-nitrotoluene migrated large distances in the subsurface soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.30X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Photolysis can occur on surfaces exposed to sunlight. Biodegradation screening tests have shown that 3-nitrotoluene can degrade very slowly in tests using unacclimated media such as the Japanese MITI test and a 64-day silt loam soil inoculum test. However, biodegradation in acclimated media can be relatively fast with 98-100% degradation within a few days or two weeks. If released into water, 3-nitrotoluene is expected to adsorb moderately to suspended solids and sediment based upon its estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon the Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 38 days, respectively. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Measured BCF values of 0.47-16 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 3-Nitrotoluene has been observed to be partially or completely degraded in aqueous sewage treatment systems, and completely degraded in aquifers, and in rivers or streams. Half lives for degradation in the studied aquatic environments ranged from less than 3 days to greater than 64 days. Photodegradation is expected to occur in water surfaces exposed to sunlight. Occupational exposure to 3-nitrotoluene may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-nitrotoluene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 3-nitrotoluene via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Field monitoring at a munition factory site in Melbourne Australia found that 3-nitrotoluene migrated large distances in the subsurface soil(3); 3-nitrotoluene is reported to have low soil Kd sorption coefficients in a variety of soil types(3) indicating it will leach. Volatilization of 3-nitrotoluene from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 9.30X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). 3-Nitrotoluene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.107 mm Hg(5). Biodegradation screening tests have shown that 3-nitrotoluene can degrade very slowly in tests using unacclimated media such as the Japanese MITI test(6) or a 64-day silt loam soil inoculum test(7). However, biodegradation in acclimated media can be relatively fast with 98-100% degradation within a few days or two weeks(8-10). 3-Nitrotoluene is susceptible to direct photolysis(11,12); therefore, photodegradation may occur on surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.30X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 days and 38 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), BCF measured values of 0.47 to 16 in fish(6,7) suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation screening tests have shown that 3-nitrotoluene can degrade very slowly in tests using unacclimated media such as the Japanese MITI test(7). However, biodegradation in acclimated media can be relatively fast with 98-100% degradation within a few days or two weeks(8-12). It was shown to be degraded in a river water in the Netherlands, with a half-life of 2.7 days(11). The photolysis rate constant for 3-nitrotoluene in near surface water at latitude 40 deg N has been experimentally determined to be 6.5 L/days(13). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Using unacclimated sludge as the inocululm(2) but lower concentrations of 3-nitrotoluene (10 ppm), complete degradation was observed to occur within 14 days. Other evidence supports complete aerobic degradation of 10 mg/L 3-nitrotoluene within 2 weeks when incubated in adapted aerobic composite river sediment and sewage sludges(3). When nitrotoluene-adapted activated sludges were used as an inoculum, however, 3-nitrotoluene (200 mg/L) was almost completely degraded (i.e. 98% removal) within 5 days when incubated at 20 \u00b0C(4). Using a mixed culture isolated from a contaminated soil (near an ammunition plant), 3-nitrotoluene (at initial concentrations of 5 and 12 mg/L) degraded completely in 4 days in aerobic batch and continuous reactor tests(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 17 days at an atmospheric concentration of 0.5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 3-Nitrotoluene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(2). 3-Nitrotoluene absorbs uv light strongly above 290 nm(3) which suggests that 3-nitrotoluene is susceptible to direct photolysis in the environment(SRC). In aqueous solution, 3-nitrotoluene has a quantum yield of 0.0158 at 313 nm(4) indicating that direct photolysis will occur in sunlight(SRC). 3-Methyl-2-nitrophenol, 3-methyl-6-nitrophenol, and 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol are primary photodegradates of 3-nitrotoluene(5). The photolysis rate constant in pure water for 3-nitrotoluene in near surface water at latitude 40 deg N has been experimentally determined to be 6.5 L/days which corresponds to a half-life of 0.11 days(6); the photolysis rate has been experimentally determined to increase in waters containing humic substances(6).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

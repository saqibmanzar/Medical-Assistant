Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

Methylation is catalysed by thiopurine methyltransferase in the cytoplasm and thiol methyltransferase in microsomes, and both reactions require S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl group donor. Thiopurine methyltransferase is present in human liver, kidney, and erythrocytes; preferential substrates for this enzyme include aromatic and heterocyclic thiols. S-Methylation of aliphatic thiols is catalysed by microsomal thiol methyltransferase, and the resulting methyl thioether (sulfide) metabolite would undergo S-oxidation to give the methyl sulfoxide and methyl sulfone analogues as urinary products. Thiols may react with glutathione and other endogenous thiol substances to form mixed disulfides. Both microsomal and cytoplasmic thioltransferasess have been reported to catalyse the formation of mixed disulfides. The resulting mixed disulfides can undergo reduction back to thiols, oxidative desulfuration, or oxidation to a sulfonic acid via the intermediate thiosulfinate and sulfinic acids. The principal form in the circulation would probably be a mixed disulfide formed with albumin. /Simple thiols/",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Medical surveillance for respiratory disease should be conducted by using the principles and methods recommended by NIOSH and the American Thoracic Society (ATS). A preplacement medical evaluation is recommended in order to detect and assess preexisting or concurrent conditions which may be aggravated or result in increased risk when a worker is exposed to n-butyl mercaptan at or below the NIOSH REL. The examining physician should consider the probable frequency, intensity, and duration of exposure, as well as the nature and degree of the condition, in placing such a worker. Such conditions, which should not be regarded as absolute contraindications to job placement, include chronic diseases of the respiratory system. /Ethyl mercaptan/",

The nematocide Mocap had been applied to a 145 acre field at 118 pounds/acre (11.8 pounds/acre as the active ingredient) after seed potatoes were planted. Mocap was air blasted onto the soil, and tilled in; the field was then irrigated. N-Propyl-mercaptan (107039), a contaminant and degradation product of Mocap, has a characteristic onion like odor. This prompted a survey of the entire population of the town (population 1000). Most of the houses in the town were within 0.8 kilometers of the edge of the potato field. Health survey questionnaires were completed by 421 residents. Headache, diarrhea, runny nose, sore throat, burning/itching eyes, fever, hay fever attacks and asthma attacks had the most highly elevated health effect incidence risks. While the residents of the town did appear to experience an increase in symptoms associated with exposure to n-propyl-mercaptan, this increase was not strictly a function of proximity of the resident to the sprayed field. With the exception of skin rash, the perception of odor appeared related significantly to the occurrence of symptoms. The stronger the perceived odor and the longer its duration, the greater the number of effects reported and their severity. The authors recommend that human exposure to n-propyl-mercaptan be minimized to the extent practicable through restricted applications and modified agricultural uses.",

Propyl mercaptan is found in manure gas from domestic animal pens, in various crude oils, and in volatile products from onions and related plant bulbs, and is formed by biological processes. If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 154 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propyl mercaptan will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase propyl mercaptan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hours. Propyl mercaptan does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, propyl mercaptan is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 230. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.08X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Propyl mercaptan may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Slow biooxidation using a Warburg test(8) suggests that biodegradation not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, propyl mercaptan is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.6 hours and 3.5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to propyl mercaptan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propyl mercaptan is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to propyl mercaptan via inhalation of certain raw food aromas, such as onion, chicken, and beef. (SRC)",

The hydroxyl radical reaction proceeds primarily through OH addition to the sulfur(1); based upon chamber experiments with similar sulfur compounds(4), the reaction products may include propylsulfonic acid(SRC). Propyl mercaptan is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(5). Propyl mercaptan does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The conversion of this compound in soil to 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloroazobenzene is catalyzed by soil peroxidases. This reaction also occurs in the presence of crystalline horseradish peroxidase. In some plants propanil is rapidly hydrolyzed to give 3,4-dichloroaniline. Crude extracts of barnyard grass, fresh horseradish root, rice & commercially purified crystalline horseradish enzyme were prepared. It was inferred that the differences in substrate specificity among peroxidases may account for the failure of some plants to convert the aniline to azo compounds such as in the conversion to 3,4-dichloroaniline to 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloroazobenzene. ... Enzymatically catalyzed products of mono- & dichloroanilines were prepared by mixing barnyard grass supernatants or horseradish peroxidase with an acetic buffer, hydrogen peroxide & various aniline substrates & allowed to react for 30 min. Preparations made from fresh horseradish & from horseradish peroxidase gave products with all anilines except 2,5- & 2,6-dichloroanilines. Barnyard grass & rice plants gave products only with 2,3-dichloroaniline of the dichloroaniline substrates studied. /Dichloroanilines/",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.5X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,5-dichloroaniline will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,5-dichloroaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours. If released to soil, 2,5-dichloroaniline is expected to have moderate mobility based upon a Koc of 355. However, when released to soil containing humic material, 2,5-dichloroaniline may undergo a covalent chemical bonding resulting in its chemical alteration to a latent form resulting in strong adsorption. 2,5-Dichloroaniline demonstrated almost a linear rate of decomposition in Guelph loam over a 12 week period, with a half-life of 8 weeks. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Using the modified AFNOR Test (28 days of incubation), 7% of initial 2,5-dichloroaniline underwent biodegradation based on DOC analysis. If released into water, 2,5-dichloroaniline is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 30 and 219 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 35 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 2,5-dichloroaniline may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,5-dichloroaniline is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 2,5-dichloroaniline via drinking water and dermal contact with this compound in dye products containing 2,5-dichloroaniline. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 30 and 219 days, respectively(SRC), using an estimation method(3). However, this model underestimates the volatilization half-life of 2,5-dichloroaniline since it does not take into account the effects of adsorption. The Koc of 355(2) suggests that volatilization could be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediments in water(SRC). This is apparent from the results of two EXAMS model runs, one in which the effect of adsorption was considered, yielding an estimated half-life of 662 days in a model pond 2 m deep, and one in which the effect of adsorption was ignored, yielding an estimated half-life of 317 days in a model pond 2 m deep(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 35(3,SRC), from a log Kow value of 2.92(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate.",

Using the modified OECD Screening Test (activated sludge inocula, 28 days aerobic incubation), less than 25% of initial 2,5-dichloroaniline was degraded based on DOC analysis(6).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 2,5-dichloroaniline is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as approximately 30 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as approximately 219 days(SRC). However, the volatilization half-life does not take into account the effects of adsorption. A Koc of 355(3) suggests that volatilization could be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediments in water(SRC). This is apparent from the results of two EXAMS model runs, one in which the effect of adsorption was considered, yielding an estimated half-life of 662 days in a model pond 2 m deep, and one in which the effect of adsorption was ignored, yielding an estimated half-life of 317 days in a model pond 2 m deep(4). 2,5-Dichloroaniline's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 2,5-Dichloroaniline is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 1.5X10-2 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5).",

Samples taken upstream of Hamburg at Zollenspieker had concns of 13 ng/l (minimum) 65 ng/l (max) and 31 ng/l (median) while samples downstream at Seem had concns of 6.6 ng/l (minimum) 70 ng/l (max) and 24 ng/l (median) of 2,5-dichloroaniline(1). Samples of 100 l were taken from the North Sea at a depth of 5 m. 2,5-Dichloroaniline was detected at 0.038, 0.036, 0.20, 0.064, 0.46, and 0.19 ng/l at points 1, 4, 9, 27, 30, and 36 respectively in the North Sea in 1990. In 1995, 2,5-dichloroaniline was detected only at points 27, 30, and 36 at concns of 0.65, 0.30, and 0.060 ng/l, respectively (limits of detection 0.01 ng/l)(2). In 1979, 2,5-Dichloroaniline was detected along the Rhine River in 13 of 46 samples at Lobith, Germany (0.39 ppb (max) and 0.04 ppb (mean)), 4 of 12 samples at Boven Merwede, Netherlands (0.32 ppb (max) and 0.05 ppb (mean)) and 3 of 13 samples at Ijssel, Netherlands (0.40 ppb (max) and 0.04 ppb (mean)). 2,5-Dichloroaniline was detected along the Meuse River in 0 of 9 samples at Eijsden, Netherlands and 2 of 12 samples at Lith, Netherlands (0.07 ppb (max) and 0.01 ppb (mean))(3).",

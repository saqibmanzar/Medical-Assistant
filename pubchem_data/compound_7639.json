PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Management of seizures in both children and adults is with Valium or phenobarbital.

Doses were administered by stomach-tube. Doses of 5000 mg/kg bw and over were subdivided in 2 half-doses daily. The only systemic effect of the 10,000 mg/kg bw daily dose was the liver enlargement. There were mild cellular changes in the liver, consisting of vacuolation of the lobular cells. The increase in liver-weight occurred at all doses, and was graded according to dose. The reduction of growth occurred only on doses of 5000 mg/kg bw and above, and the vacuolation of liver cells was marked at the highest dose level of 10,000 mg/kg bw daily. Additional experiments in rats showed that the major part of the liver hypertrophy occurs in the first few weeks of feeding chlorbenside and continued feeding after this point has little further effect. The liver hypertrophy is reversible, and the liver-weight returns nearly to normal within two weeks of stopping treatment.",

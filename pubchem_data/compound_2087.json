PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

They are discussed together in this fact sheet because aldrin quickly breaks down to dieldrin in the body and in the environment. Pure aldrin and dieldrin are white powders with a mild chemical odor.

Neither substance occurs naturally in the environment From the 1950s until 1970, aldrin and dieldrin were widely used pesticides for crops like corn and cotton. Because of concerns about damage to the environment and potentially to human health, EPA banned all uses of aldrin and dieldrin in 1974, except to control termites. In 1987, EPA banned all uses.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Seven cyclodiene insecticides, gamma -hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma -BHC), beta -BHC, and hexachlorobenzene had no significant effect on the specific binding of ((3)H)Flu or ((3)H)muscimol. The results suggest that the ionic channel of the GABA receptor in mammalian brain is a primary target for the toxic action of gamma -BHC and cyclodienes. /Cyclodiene insecticides/",

All the 3 cyclodiene compounds inhibited both brain synaptosomal and heart sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-pump activity in vitro in a concentration dependent manner. Calmodulin depleted Ca2+-pump activity was insensitive to the action of toxic compounds. Oral administration of pesticides (0.5-10 mg/kg) to rats similarly decreased the Ca2+-pump activity, in addition to decreasing the levels of calmodulin of both brain and heart thus indicating disruption in membrane Ca2+ transport mechanisms. Exogenous addition of calmodulin (1-20 micrograms) could effectively reverse the pesticide induced inhibition. Ca2+-pump activity is more sensitive to the 3 cyclodiene compounds in brain than in heart. The results of the present study indicate that the cyclodiene compounds may produce neurotoxic effects by altering calmodulin regulated calcium dependent events in neurons. /Cyclodiene insecticides/",

The precision and a method accuracy were found to be directly related to the concentration of the analyte and essentially independent of the sample matrix.",

Neither substance occurs naturally in the environment From the 1950s until 1970, aldrin and dieldrin were widely used pesticides for crops like corn and cotton. Because of concerns about damage to the environment and potentially to human health, EPA banned all uses of aldrin and dieldrin in 1974, except to control termites. In 1987, EPA banned all uses.",

Reverse osmosis system permeation rates, variations in permeation rates with time, and removal efficiencies for various substances are presented. Chlorinated hydrocarbon and organic phosphate pesticides were almost completely removed by reverse osmosis, while heavy metal removal was consistently greater than 95%. Removal rates for other substances varied from 43-90%, depending on the substance and on the type of membrane used.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Technical grade aldrin is tan in color. Aldrin has been used in various formulations which include emulsifiable concentrates, wettable powders, granules, dusts and solutions in hydrocarbon liquids. Aldrin has a mild chemical odor, and is very soluble in most organic solvents (aromatics, esters, ketones, paraffins and halogenated solvents. Impurities of aldrin include octachlorocyclopentene, hexachlorobutadiene, toluene and a mixture of compounds formed by polymerization during the aldrin reaction along with carbonyl compounds. Aldrin is very effective soil insecticide and has been used to treat seeds. It has been used to control termites, corn root worms, seed corn beetle and maggot, wire worms, rice water weevil, grasshoppers and Japanese beetles. HUMAN EXPOSURE: The CNS seems to be the primary site with resultant seizures. Toxic exposures produce tremors, giddiness, hyperexcitability, seizures and comas. Poisoning occurs mainly through absorption through the skin. Epidemiological studies do not show any carcinogenic risk. Absorption can occur by inhalation, dermal and gastrointestinal routes. Clinical toxicity from aldrin actually is due to its rapid metabolism in the body to dieldrin. Symptoms reflect CNS toxicity due to GABA neurotransmission inhibition. Headache, tremors, hyperexcitability, seizures and comas have been noted. Respiratory absorption occurs, expiratory aldrin concentrations are decreased compared to inspired concentrations. Aldrin is rapidly converted to dieldrin primarily in the liver. Consequently little aldrin is found in the blood or tissues. Autopsy cases show dieldrin levels in the brain, liver and adipose tissue. After chronic oral human administration, blood dieldrin concentrations decreases exponentially following first order kinetics with an estimated half life of 369 days. Elimination occurs primarily through the feces via the bile. 9-Hydroxydieldrin seems to be the major metabolite excreted. Dieldrin is also excreted in the breast milk. Small amounts of dieldrin metabolites are excreted in the urine after either topical or iv administration. Dieldrin metabolites may also be found in the urine after ingestion. There have been a few cases of aldrin toxicity in children with resulting signs of CNS stimulation similar to adults. Death has resulted after acute ingestion. The fetus concentrates dieldrin, and the possibility of contaminated breast milk consumption increase the risk of CNS effects in the very young. Increased sister chromatid exchanges and exchange type chromosome aberrations were noted in floriculturists after exposure to several pesticides including aldrin. Cardiovascular complications include blood pressure fluctuations and tachycardia after overdose. Blood urea nitrogen levels, gross hematuria and albuminuria for several days after an acute overdose  was noted. No dermatitis was seen in pesticide manufacturing workers. Normal hematological parameters were noted in pesticide manufacturing workers during at least a four years of follow up. ANIMAL/BACTERIAL/VIRAL/CELL STUDIES: Inhalation exposure to aldrin in several species resulted in death. Single dermal applications of aldrin in xylene produced death in test animals. Oral administration of aldrin to rats causes convulsions. Aldrin induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in SV-40 transformed human fibroblast cells (VA-4) both in the presence and absence of rat liver microsomes, The DNA breakage rates in Escherichia coli plasmid after treatment with aldrin or dieldrin did not differ from those in untreated plasma DNA  suggesting that, at least in these studies, the compounds did not interact directly with DNA. The effects of aldrin and dieldrin on the uptake of tritiated thymidine by cultured rat thymocytes and human lymphocytes were tested under different experimental conditions. Both compounds appeared to have marginal effects on thymidine uptake, suggesting inhibition of DNA synthesis. Aldrin and dieldrin did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary cultures of Fischer 344 rat hepatocytes. In the hepatocyte primary culture/DNA repair test using freshly isolated hepatocytes of high metabolic capability to monitor the production of DNA damage by measuring DNA repair synthesis. Aldrin and dieldrin gave equivocal results concerning DNA repair, but there was no damage to DNA. Aldrin induced DNA strand breaks in an alkaline elution rat hepatocyte assay. Both aldrin and dieldrin inhibited gap junctional intercellular communication between 6-thioguanine sensitive and 6-thioguanine resistant human teratocarcinoma cells in culture. No increased incidence of malignant neoplasms have been found in several studies. In animal assays there was an increased incidence of hepatic tumors including hepatocellular adenomas. In animal studies, aldrin did cause an increase in fetal mortality, increased incidence of cleft palate and webbed foot and a decreased postnatal survival have been reported.[",

Levels of both (14)C-labeled endrin and (3)H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane were monitored in serum, gall bladders, and whole bodies during pre- and post exposures to each cmpd in mosquitofish. (3)H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane for 4 hr generally reduced (14)C-labeled endrin accumulation in serum, gall bladders and whole bodies, whereas prior exposure to (14)C-labeled endrin exerted little effect on (3)H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane accumulation. Simultaneous exposure to (3)H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane and (14)C-labeled endrin reduced (3)H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane accumulation in the gall bladder at all times and in the whole body during the first 2 hr; (14)C-labeled endrin accumulation was generally reduced in the gall bladder and whole body. (14)C-Labeled endrin levels in fish exposed subsequently to only (3)H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane or 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethene were significantly higher in the gall bladder at all times after 0.5 hr and were reduced in the whole body at all times tested, compared to fish exposed subsequently only to uncontaminated water. While (14)C-labeled endrin post-treatment had no effect on (3)H-labeled 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane levels in the gall bladder, aldrin and dieldrin exposure resulted in significantly higher gall bladder levels of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane compared to fish exposed subsequently only to uncontaminated water. The insecticide interactions observed may be the result of competition for and/or displacement of insecticides from mutual binding sites.",

Another group of 40 rats dosed with 60 mg aldrin/kg po received 0, 4, 8, or 12 mg MgCl2/kg i.m. The % of tonic-clonic convulsant rats that resulted from MgCl2 treatment were 90% at 0 mg/kg, 50% at 4 mg/kg, 40% at 8 mg/kg & 20% at 12 mg MgCl2/kg. The % of survivors in the group receiving 12 mg MgCl2/kg was 80% while the control group had 20% survival. The clonic convulsions were not modified by MgCl2 treatment. Blood & brain concns of aldrin & dieldrin (metabolite of aldrin) did not differ among groups. The MgCl2 admin decr the neuroexcitability induced by aldrin & incr survivability.",

Oils should not be used as either cathartics or dermal cleansing agents, as they increase absorption. Gastric lavage and use of activated charcoal and sodium sulfate are indicated for ingestion. If dermal exposure occurred, contaminated clothes should be removed, and the skin should be thoroughly cleansed with soap and water. Management of seizures in both children and adults is with Valium or phenobarbital. Respiratory depression and even respiratory arrest especially with concomitant use of Valium and phenobarbital in children, may occur. These drugs preferably should be used only in critical care areas where emergency endotracheal intubation can be performed. ... Epinephrine can not be utilized in patients with organochlorine posioning, as the organochlorines induce myocardial irritability and ventricular arrhythmias may occur. However, dopamine may be necessary in the event of hypotension unresponsive to fluid administration, and epinephrin may be necessary in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest. ... In a critically ill patient with unknown insecticide exposure, a trial of atropine and pralidoxime should not be withheld until the etiologic agent is discovered, for the use of these agents may prove life-saving in organophosphate poisoning. Atropine must be used with caution, as it can cause ventricular irritability, especially when a mycardial irritant such as an organochlorine is present. ... Hematologic, hepatic (especially with endrin, which is markedly hepatotoxic), and renal studies as well as cardiopulmonary monitoring should be carried out in acute intoxication from lindane or other organochlorines for at least 48 to 72 hr. Long term hematologic follow-up is necessary for the patient with lindane intoxication. As the carrier for these agents may be xylene or a petroleum distillate, management also must include observation and treatment for these entities. /Organochlorine pesticides/",

Fourteen patients with convulsions caused by the insecticides all show specific anomalies in the electroencephalogram, consisting of bilateral synchronous theta wave activity and occasional bilateral synchronous spike and wave complexes believed to be associated with brain stem injury. A systematic survey of a large group of exposed workers reveals that the same specific wave form anomalies may occur without preceding or subsequent convulsions and even without any clinical symptoms or signs. Periodic electroencephalographic examination is suggested as a valuable method for the detection of early subclinical intoxication.",

Beef heart mitochondrial (oligomycin-sensitive) Mg(2+) ATPase activity was inhibited by all chemicals at all concentrations tested. Aldrin was the most potent inhibitor with IC50 of 40 um; about 30% was observed with dieldrin and inhibition was not concentration-dependent. Rat brain synaptosomal ATPases were most sensitive to aldrin and telodrin. A 50% inhibition of oligomycin-sensitive Mg(2+) ATPase activity was obtained at 80 umolar air of aldrin. Na + K+ ATPase and oligomycin-insensitive Mg(2+) ATPase activities showed max inhibition of 40% at highest concentration tested for aldrin.

The increase in toxicity is very significant in the case of the amphipod,Gammarus (1.5-12 times), bluegill fry (3.6-5.7 times), mosquito larvae,Aedas (2.3-6 times), minnow fry (2.5 times), and the isopid,Asellus (2 times). Photodieldrin is 12 and 5 times more toxic than dieldrin, respectively, to Gammarus, and to blue-gill fry, photoaldrin is 6 and 4 times more toxic than aldrin, respectively, to mosquito larvae and bluegill fry. The toxicities of the photoisomers of isodrin and chlordene are generally less than those of their parent compounds",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.2X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates aldrin will exist solely in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase aldrin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6 hrs. Aldrin has a UV absorption max of 227 nm and photodegradative half-life of 113 hrs and dieldrin is the primary photoproduct. If released to soil, aldrin is expected to have moderate to no mobility based upon a range of Koc values of 400-28,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. A loss of 50% of surface applied aldrin to soil was estimated to occur within 1-2 weeks after application compared to 10-15 weeks for soil-incorporated aldrin. Aldrin was classified as moderately persistent with a half-life in soil ranging from 20-100 days. In soil, aldrin is converted to dieldrin by epoxidation, which occurs in aerobic and biologically-active soils. If released into water, aldrin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the range of Koc values. A river die-away test was conducted in capped bottles with aldrin in raw water from the Little Miami River in Ohio. After 2, 4, and 8 weeks, 20, 60, and 80% of the initial amount of aldrin had degraded. Aldrin may be degraded rapidly under anaerobic conditions based on an anaerobic wastewater study. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. In a laboratory study using distilled water, the volatilization half-life of aldrin was 5.8 days at 30 \u00b0C and a depth of approximately 1 cm. Experimental BCF values ranging from 735 to 20,000 suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to aldrin via ingestion of food and drinking water containing aldrin. (SRC)",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.4X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isodrin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase isodrin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.2 days. Particulate-phase isodrin may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition. Isodrin will undergo phototransformation when irradiated with natural sunlight. If released to soil, isodrin is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.1X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.9X10-4 atm-cu m/mole; however, in soils with organic carbon, volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to soil solids as indicated by an estimated Koc of 1.1X10+5. Isodrin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, isodrin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9.9 hours and 8.9 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 4.6 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 3.1X10+4 suggests the potential bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hyrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to isodrin may have occurred occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isodrin was produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to isodrin via ingestion of fish and dermal contact with this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization of aldrin from soil is more rapid when it is applied to the soil surface rather than incorporated into the soil(5). A loss of 50% from a surface application was estimated to occur within 1-2 weeks after application compared to 10-15 weeks for soil-incorporated aldrin(5).

After 30, 90, 120, 240, and 270 days, 44.2%, 55.4%, 74.13%, 88.07%, and 100% of the aldrin had dissipated from the soil(1). Aldrin applied at 20 lb/acre (incorporated into first 6 inches) to muck and loam had respective half-lives of 3.75 and 2.40 months for the first half-year and 13.0 and 9.7 months for the following three years(2). Three and one-half years following the application to a Miami silt loam of 20 and 200 lb aldrin incorporated 6 inches per acre, 1.12% and 2.55%, respectively, of the calculated initial amount of aldrin remained(2). Aldrin was applied 20 lb incorporated 6 inches per acre to Miami silt loam and at 100 lb incorporated 6 inches per acre to Plainfield sand(2). After incubation for 56 days at 6, 26, and 46 \u00b0C, 83.8%, 55.7% and 13.7% of the initial amount of recoverable aldrin remained on the Miami silt loam and 63%, 38%, and 10.2% remained on the Plainfield sand, respectively(2). After 2 months incubation at 30 \u00b0C, 44%, 58%, and 33% of about 15 ppm of aldrin applied remained in the Maahas, Louisiana, and Casiguran soils under upland (80% water saturated), respectively, and under flooded conditions, 65%, 81%, 74%, and 64% remained in the Pila, Maahas, Louisiana and Casiguran soils, respectively(3). Soils were treated with aldrin at 5 lb/acre from 1958-62(4). Dieldrin was formed from aldrin in the soil and constituted 50 and 90% of the aldrin plus dieldrin residues recovered in 1959 and 1963, respectively(4). Soils from AR, FL, HI, MD, MT, OR, and SC were treated with 10 ml of 0.5% aqueous aldrin emulsion/10 g soil(5). The preparations were placed randomly around a test site in the Harrison Experimental Forest in southern Mississippi. In all preparations except the Hawaiian soil, the percent degradation in the upper 0.5 inch layer (36-72%) was greater than in the lower layer (unspecified depth) (11-33%). In the Hawaiian soil samples, degradation in the lower layer was 63% and in the upper layer was 49%(5). Aldrin was converted into dieldrin in these studies(5). When aldrin was applied to agricultural soils in Germany, Spain, England and the United States, significant amounts of dieldrin derived from the applied aldrin were detected in the soils within 6 months of aldrin application(6). Aldrin was classified as moderately persistent meaning its half-life in soil ranged from 20-100 days(7).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 27 hrs and 19 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 52 yrs if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), BCFs ranging from 735 to 20,000(7-11), suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). A river die-away test was conducted in capped bottles with aldrin in raw water from the Little Miami River in Ohio. The river receives domestic and industrial wastes and farm runoff(12). After 2, 4, and 8 weeks, 20, 60, and 80% of the initial amount of aldrin had degraded(12).",

Vapor-phase aldrin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.5X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) determined using a structure estimation method(3). Slow photolysis of aldrin vapor (60% in one week vs 16% in a dark control) was observed(4). This is expected due to the weak absorption of aldrin above 290 nm(5).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.9X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9.9 hours and 8.9 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 4.6 years if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 2.1X10+4(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 6.75(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC).

Vapor-phase isodrin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.2 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.7X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase isodrin may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). Isodrin will undergo phototransformation when irradiated with natural sunlight(4-6).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of approximately 6 hrs at an atmospheric concn of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Aldrin has a UV absorbance max of 227 nm; and photodegradative half-life of 113 hours(2). Studies indicate that aldrin will also react with nitrogen dioxide in the ambient atmosphere to produce dieldrin(2). After 3 hours of exposure to nitrogen dioxide and UV radiation >290 nm, 32% of vapor-phase aldrin was converted to dieldrin(2). Aldrin, irradiated with ultraviolet light in an oxygenated aqueous solution, underwent little change except in the presence of amino acids and humic acids in natural waters(2). Aldrin is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). An extrapolated hydrolysis rate constant of 3.8X10-5/hr at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C has been determined for aldrin based on a measured value at 75 \u00b0C; the half-life for this reaction is 760 days(2).",

Dieldrin (50-60 ug) and photoaldrin (20-30 ug) were the photo-products. Irradiation of 1 ug of aldrin vapor with the sunlamp for 168 hours resulted in 60% degradation compared to 16% degradation in a dark control(1). Dieldrin (0.63 ug) was the primary photo-product and photoaldrin (0.02 ug) and photodieldrin (0.02 ug) were also detected(1). A photolysis half-life of 1.1 day was determined for 0.33 ppb aldrin in San Francisco Bay water exposed to sunlight, although insufficient detail concerning the experimental conditions is available to conclude that this result was due solely to direct photolysis(2). Exposure of an aldrin film to sunlight for 1 month resulted in a solution containing 2.6% unchanged aldrin and 9.6% photoaldrin, 4.1% dieldrin, 24.1% photodieldrin and 59.7% of an unidentified product(3). Photolysis half-lives of thin films of aldrin irradiated at >300 nm were 4.7, 8.3, and 11 days, respectively(4). Solid aldrin adsorbed on silica gel, and irradiated at >290 nm for 6 days, was 11% mineralized(5). A 0.07 M aqueous solution of aldrin was 25% photooxidized by constituents of natural waters(6). Irradiation of aldrin in 0.05 M hydrogen peroxide for 12 hr at >290 nm reduced the aldrin concn by 79.5% compared to a dark control in which the aldrin concn decreased by 32.9%(7).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 0.2 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals/cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of isodrin with ozone has been estimated as 20X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 0.057 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules/cu cm(2). Isodrin is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Isodrin will undergo phototransformation when irradiated with natural sunlight(4-6). The yields and products may vary with the wavelength of the light, the irradiation period and the physical state of the irradiated material(4). Photoisodrin is a phototransformation product of isodrin(4,6). Rotenone may act as a sensitizer to accelerate the photoalteration of isodrin adsorbed onto solid surfaces(5). Irradiation of aldrin, dieldrin, and isodrin in the presence of the photosensitizer, benzophenone, afforded the respective photoisomers in yields of 58-90%(6). The data suggest that photoisodrin was formed via the triplet state(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that aldrin is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 27 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 19 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 52 years if adsorption is considered(3). The volatile loss of aldrin from sterile, deionized water kept at 30 \u00b0C was studied over a 30 day period; the volatilization half-life of aldrin from the open flask (1-5 ug aldrin per ml distilled water at a depth of approximately 1 cm in a 4 ml Wheaton vial) was 5.8 days(4). Aldrin's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Volatilization of aldrin from soil is more rapid when it is applied to the soil surface rather than incorporated into the soil(4). A loss of 50% from a surface application was estimated to occur within 1-2 weeks after application compared to 10-15 weeks for soil-incorporated aldrin(4). Aldrin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.2X10-4 mm Hg(5).",

Following passage of air at 1 l/min windspeed at 22 \u00b0C and 100% relative humidity over quartz sand and Miami silt loam treated with 4 ppm aldrin, 37.9% and 16.3% of the initial aldrin were recovered in the vapor from the quartz sand and Miami silt loam, respectively, and 55.3% and 79.7% recovered from the two soils, respectively(1). Volatilization rates of aldrin from sand, loam, and humus were 1.1%, 0.2% and 0.8%/ml evaporated water after the first hour and 0.6%, 0.2%, and 0.1%/ml evaporated water in the second hour, respectively(2).

This Henry's Law constant indicates that isodrin is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 9.9 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 8.9 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water and moist soil surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 4.6 years when adsorption is considered(3). Isodrin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a an estimated vapor pressure of 4.4X10-5 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3).",

The fish were obtained from commercial fishermen in 1985: Pagellus erythrinus, Sargus vulgaris, Siganus rivulatis, Sphyraena sphyraena, and Trigla herundo from Abu Qir Bay; and Tilapia fish from Idku and Maryut Lakes. Twenty grams of dorsal fish muscle were extracted and the residues analyzed by GLC; reagent blanks and spike samples were included with each sample. The waters from which the fish were obtained receive drainage from industrial, agricultural and urban activities. Water samples were not assayed for specific components. Assays for aldrin indicated it was present in low concns. The highest value obtained was 19.9 ug/kg in Sargus vulgarius from Abu Qir Bay. Aldrin was present in low and similar amounts (1.1-3.5 ug/kg) in small and medium sized Tilapia nilotica. Size ranges of Tilapia zilli showed variation of 5.7 ug/kg (small) to 13.1 ug/kg (large) in the concn of aldrin in muscle tissue. All samples were well below permissible levels for aldrin(1).",

The NOES survey does not include farm workers. Occupational exposure to aldrin may have occurred through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where aldrin was produced or used(SRC). During the period of widespread use and production of aldrin and dieldrin, intake by workers was estimated to range from 0.72 to 1.10 mg/person/day(2). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to aldrin from former uses via ingestion of food and drinking water containing this compound(SRC). Inhalation of contaminated air may be a significant route of exposure for persons living in aldrin-treated homes(SRC). Cessation of aldrin production and use is expected to eventually eliminate human exposure to the insecticide in the USA but will result in dieldrin exposure. This latter exposure will also decrease with time(SRC).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Male mice of ICR strain were exposed to about 5% n-pentane for one hour while the oxygen in the environmental air was maintained at about 20%. Then their blood and liver tissue were collected and analyzed by means of GC and GC-MS. The metabolites thus obtained were 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol and 2-pentanone. The same procedure was repeated with isopentane; 3-methyl-2-butanol, 2-methyl-2-butanol and 3-methyl-2-butanone were detected as the resultant metabolites. In the presence of the NADPH-generating system liver microsomes were made to react to the substrate of saturated n-pentane or isopentane aqueous solution at 37 degrees C for one hour. As a result, the same metabolites were produced as obtained in the exposure experiment. It was therefore suggested that n-pentane and isopentane were metabolized chiefly by liver microsomes.",

Once in the body it distributes to the tissues and blood, with the highest concentration in the adipose tissue. Pentane is metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system.

These intermediates are further metabolized to glucuronic acid conjugates or oxidized to ketone products, which are excreted in the urine and expired air. (A600)",

When the total hydrocarbon concentration of the sampled environment was 100 ppm, the collection of efficiency was greater than 90 percent for total hydrocarbon concentration, isobutane, n-butane, and isopentane at flow rates of 10 or 100 mL/min.

It has been suggested that pentane, which can be formed during the oxidation of omega-6 fatty acids, is a marker of lipid peroxidation. Previous studies have reported elevated breath pentane and serum markers of lipid peroxidation in smokers. However, chromatographic separation of pentane from isoprene in virtually all of these studies was incomplete and the methods used did not resolve pentane into its isomers, n-pentane and isopentane. Additionally, most current methods are complicated, requiring trapping and concentrating steps to obtain adequate sensitivity prior to hydrocarbon analysis. The purpose of the current study was to develop a gas chromatographic system to analyze breath pentane, that addresses the above technical problems and that would provide a simple in vivo method for measuring lipid. n-Pentane and isopentane standards were easily separated from isoprene with a Al2O3/KCI capillary column contained in a portable gas chromatograph equipped with a photoionization detector. The analysis of repeated measures showed a low coefficient of variation for measurements of n-pentane (10%) and isopentane (9%). We measured breath pentane in 27 subjects (15 smokers, 12 non-smokers). There were no significant difference between the baseline and 4 week interval measurements of n-pentane for smokers both before and after cigarette smoking. The within-subject variability data showed that the assay is highly reproducible for both low and high pentane levels in smokers. Smokers were found to have higher levels of both n-pentane and isopentane than non-smokers (P < 0.001). In addition, smokers had further significant elevation of pentane levels 10 min after smoking (P < 0.001), which returned to baseline by 1 hr. These studies demonstrate that measurement of breath pentane, using a gas chromatograph with a photoionization detector, is simple and reproducible. Additionally, these results suggest that pentane elevation associated with smoking is secondary to the oxidant effects of cigarette smoke and an important temporal relationship exists between cigarette smoking and breath sample analysis.",

Seven components of gasoline (isopentane, n-pentane, 2-methylpentane, benzene, 2-methylhexane, 3-methylhexane and toluene) and five of kerosene (xylene, C9H20, mesitylene, pseudocumene and C11H24) were chosen as indicators with a coefficient of variation of 5-24%. The methods were applied to four autopsy cases with a relatively low carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) content. When gasoline exposure had occurred, the blood concentrations determined were almost identical whatever the components selected. Great variations in the components determined were found after kerosene exposure, and hydrocarbons greater than or equal to C14 were hardly inhaled by the victims. A higher content of fuel in the left than in the right ventricular blood observed in the autopsy cases suggests fuel inhalation just before death. The same phenomenon was also observed in the content of blood HbCO. Determinations of petroleum fuel and HbCO in both the right and left ventricular blood would be useful for the forensic diagnosis on burned bodies with a low HbCO content.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as a solvent, in the manufacture of chlorinated derivatives, and as a blowing agent for polystyrene. HUMAN STUDIES: Inhalation can cause dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and unconsciousness. Skin exposure leads to dry skin. Ingestion can cause nausea and vomiting. Isopentane is an aspiration hazard. If swallowed the substance easily enters the airways and could result in aspiration pneumonitis. Isopentane causes CNS depression between 270 and 400 mg/L, and is a weak cardiac sensitizer. High vapor concentrations are irritating to the skin and eyes. ANIMAL STUDIES: In dogs, 120,000 ppm isopentane was required to induce light anesthesia. Isopentane was  lethal to dogs at levels of 150,000-170,000 ppm. Mice exposed to 90,000 ppm isopentane for 11 min showed light anesthesia. At higher concentrations (110,000 and 120,000 ppm), the CNS depression effect appeared within 4 and 2 min, respectively. In rats, no treatment-related effects of isopentane were found in relation to the reproductive capacity of parental animals or the pre- and post-natal development of the F1 generation. There were no treatment-related effects in either gender at </= 300 mg/kg/day. The mutagenic activity of isopentane has been assayed using the Ames test. At concentrations of 100,000 ppm, it was not mutagenic in the presence and absence of a metabolic activating system.",

A total of 24 male and female rats per group were given 2-methylbutane by gavage at 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/day. Males were dosed for 10 weeks prior to mating and during mating. Females were dosed from 2 weeks before mating to day 21 of lactation. At 1000 mg/kg/day, both genders exhibited an increase in adrenal gland weight, however, a decrease in body weight gain and food intake, an increase in kidney weight, and an increased incidence of histopathological changes of the kidney were also observed in male rats. No treatment-related effects of 2-methylbutane were found in relation to the reproductive capacity of parental animals or the pre- and post-natal development of the F1 generation. There were no treatment-related effects in either gender at </= 300 mg/kg/day. Under these experimental conditions, the no-observed-adverse-effect level of 2-methylbutane was 300 mg/kg/day for general toxicity and 1000 mg/kg/day for reproductive capacity and pup development in rats.",

Isopentane may also be released to the environment in the emissions of motor vehicle exhaust. Isopentane has been detected in the volatile emissions from various trees and vegetation. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 689 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isopentane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase isopentane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.1 days. Isopentane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isopentane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 60. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4 atm-cu m/mole. Isopentane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Manometric Respirometry test, 71.43% biodegradation was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, isopentane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 hours and 3.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 30 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to isopentane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isopentane is produced or used, especially for workers in the petroleum industry. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to isopentane via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, and dermal contact with consumer products containing isopentane, especially during the use of gasoline products containing isopentane.

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(6), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 hours and 3.4 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 30(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.72(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The average emission of isopentane from 46 in-use passenger cars, as measured using different driving cycles, ranged from 2.5-16.5% of the total non-methane hydrocarbon emissions from 1975-1982(2). The estimated emission of isopentane from the exhaust of petroleum run vehicles in the UK, 1983, is 15.76 ktonnes(4,5). The mean emissions of isopentane from the exhaust of gasoline-powered motor vehicles in the US was found to range from 1.41-4.79% of the total non-methane hydrocarbon emissions dependent on the gasoline blend, temperature, and vehicle type(6). The average concn of isopentane in the exhaust of 67 Australian gasoline vehicles was 4.8% w/w of non-methane hydrocarbon(7). Isopentane was identified as both an evaporative and exhaust emission from hydrocarbon and methanol-based fuels(8). Isopentane was emitted from the tailpipe of automobiles at a rate of 1300 ug isopentane per kilometer (vehicles equipped with catalytic converters) and 720,000 ug isopentane per kilometer (vehicles without catalytic converters)(9).",

It was qualitatively identified in the air above 4 of 5 hazardous waste sites monitored in NJ(2). Emissions of isopentane in the Tokyo area are associated with vehicular exhaust, gasoline vapor, petroleum refining, vehicle painting shops, ship painting yards, and petrochemcial plants(3). Isopentane was qualitatively detected in water samples and it was detected in gaseous samples at a concentration of 270 umol/L at an underwater hydrocarbon vent from an offshore production platform in the Gulf of Mexico, 1976(4). Isopentane was identified in the emissions of combusted pine wood at 5.6 mg isopentane per kg of wood burned(5). In December 2011, isopentane was detected as less than 1% of all gaseous pollutants profiled at 3 process-locations in a municipal solid waste biological treatment plant(6).",

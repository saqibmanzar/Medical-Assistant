It also inhibits protein isoprenylation, depletes plasma glutamine, increases production of foetal haemoglobin through transcriptional activation of the gamma-globin gene and affects hPPARgamma activation. It has a role as an EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer and a prodrug. It is functionally related to a butyric acid.

The urea cycle is the major pathway of elimination of excess nitrogen including ammonia, and absence of one of the urea cycle enzymes often causes elevations in serum ammonia which can be severe, life-threatening and result in permanent neurologic damage and cognitive deficiencies. Both phenylbutyrate and sodium benzoate act by promoting an alternative pathway of nitrogen elimination. Neither phenylbutyrate nor sodium benzoate have been linked to cases of liver injury either in the form of serum enzyme elevations during therapy or clinically apparent acute liver injury.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It increases waste nitrogen excretion in the form of phenylacetylglutamine.

Some studies report antineoplastic properties of phenylbutyric acid, showing that phenylbutyric acid can promote growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells. It is suggested that phenylbutyric acid can act as an ammonia scavenger, chemical chaperone, and histone deacetylase inhibitor.",

Phenylbutyrate can help to lower ammonia levels acutely and manage to keep them in the normal or near normal range, but generally does not affect other liver functions. In open label studies, a small proportion of patients (particularly with ornithine transcarbamylase [OTC] deficiency) have had ALT or AST elevations, but these have generally been attributed to the underlying condition or its complications.

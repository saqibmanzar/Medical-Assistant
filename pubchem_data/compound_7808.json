ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxicity is related to the presence of covalently bound material in these tissues. A major bromobenzene metabolite, p-bromophenol, has been shown to give rise to covalently bound material in liver, lung and kidney in vivo, but is not toxic. p-Bromophenol is formed from bromobenzene in liver, lung and kidney microsomes and is subsequently metabolized to 4-bromocatechol and covalently bound material. Bromobenzene-3,4-oxide generated in situ by liver microsomes, is detoxified by kidney, liver and lung cytosol. The results suggest that the kidney toxicity caused by bromobenzene is probably not mediated by either bromobenzene-3,4-oxide or the reactive metabolites of p-bromophenol. In contrast, bromobenzene-3, 4-oxide may play a role in the lung toxicity observed after bromobenzene administration. However, the covalently bound material found in extrahepatic tissues may be derived from both bromobenzene-3,4-oxide or the reactive metabolites of p-bromophenol, which may be formed directly by these tissues or transported there from the liver.",

The catechol undergoes autooxidation to the corresponding quinone or semiquinone, which can either covalently bind to microsomal protein or, in the presence of glutathione, form a glutathione conjugate. Superoxide dismutase inhibited these reactions by preventing the superoxide anion-mediated oxidation of 4-bromocatechol. Thus, in the presence of glutathione, superoxide dismutase caused a decrease in conjugate formation with a corresponding increase in 4-bromocatechol levels. Conditions which increased the in vitro covalent binding of p-bromophenol (namely, phenobarbital treatment and the absence of glutathione) did not cause toxicity in vivo. Thus, chemically reactive metabolite(s) of p-bromophenol do not play a role in bromobenzene-mediated hepatotoxicity.",

The metabolite profile produced upon incubation of isolated rat hepatocytes with bromobenzene differed with the hepatocyte concentration. At a low hepatocyte concentration (0.5 x 10+6 cells/mL), 4-bromophenol was the major metabolite, while at higher hepatocyte concentrations (2.0 and 5.0 x 10+6 cells/mL) bromobenzene-3,4-dihydrodiol was the major metabolite. 4-Bromophenol was the primary metabolite in incubations with rat liver microsomes. In vivo, 3- and 4-bromophenol were more predominant, with very little dihydrodiol formed. 4-Bromocatechol, a potentially toxic metabolite of bromobenzene, was formed in vivo as well as in isolated hepatocytes and microsomes. However, the mechanism of catechol formation differed, as determined by the retention of a deuterium label at the para position of bromobenzene. In microsomes, 4-bromophenol was the predominant precursor metabolite of 4-bromocatechol. In isolated hepatocytes, although the relative contribution of 4-bromophenol as the bromocatechol precursor differed with hepatocyte concentration, bromobenzene-3,4-dihydrodiol was the predominant precursor at all concentrations. In vivo, as in isolated hepatocytes, 4-bromocatechol was formed primarily via bromobenzene-3,4-dihydrodiol.",

The brominated phenols, however, although binding to the ER, did not stimulate cell growth or increase the levels of the PgR or pS2, or reduce the level of 17 beta-E induced pS2. On the contrary, 4-BP, 2,4-DBP and partly 4-tert-BP reduced 17 beta-E-stimulated cell growth apparently by an ER independent mechanism.",

The covalent binding of the phenol and the catechol was increased four- to eightfold by the addition of unlabeled bromobenzene. Two-hour incubations of 0.25 mM 14C-labeled 4-bromophenol or 4-bromocatechol with hepatocytes isolated from phenobarbital-treated rats resulted, under these conditions, in no significant toxicity, and approximately 4 and 25%, respectively, of the covalent binding associated with bromobenzene itself. Two- and six-hour incubations with higher 4-bromophenol and 4-bromocatechol concentrations demonstrated that 1 to 3 mM substrate concentrations were required for cytotoxicity. These results show that metabolically produced 4-bromophenol and 4-bromocatechol do not play significant roles in the production of bromobenzene cytotoxicity in isolated hepatocytes, and that they contribute only modestly to bromobenzene covalent binding.",

They are thought to cause the typical sea-like taste and flavor. The ecological function of brominated phenols is not clear yet, but they may play a role in chemical defense and deterrence ... In this study 2-bromophenol (2-BP), 4-bromophenol (4-BP), 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP), 2,6-dibromophenol (2,6-DBP) and 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP), all of which are present in marine organisms, were tested. Especially 2,4-DBP and 2,4,6-TBP showed a significant effect on the Ca2+ homeostasis in endocrine cells (PC 12). The reduction of depolarization induced Ca2+ elevations by 2,4-DBP and 2,4,6-TBP and the increase of intracellular Ca2+ by both substances, partly released from intracellular stores, may suggest a link to the disrupting effect of endocrine systems by brominated phenols. 2,4-DBP was the most potent substance ... tested in respect to inhibition of voltage dependent Ca2+ currents as revealed in whole cell patch clamp experiments. Brominated phenols disturb cellular Ca2+ signaling with differential efficacy, depending on the number and position of bromine.",

The same cytochromes P-450 activate both bromobenzene and p-bromophenol, and each substrate competitively inhibits the metabolism of the other. Moreover, the covalent binding of p-bromophenol to rat liver microsomes was inhibited by epoxide hydrolase, catechol-O-methyltransferase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and ascorbic acid but not by catalase. In contrast, the amount of 4-bromocatechol isolated from microsomal incubations containing p-bromophenol was decreased by glutathione and increased by ascorbic acid and superoxide dismutase. It is thus likely that p-bromophenol is converted to an epoxide that decomposes to 4-bromocatechol and that both the epoxide and the quinone formed from oxidation of 4-bromocatechol may become covalently bound to tissue proteins. However, these chemically reactive metabolites are apparently nontoxic because treatments which increase the covalent binding of p-bromophenol in vitro do not cause toxicity in vivo.",

Preincubation of renal cortical slices with each of these bromobenzene metabolites for 90 min resulted in dose-dependent decreases in the accumulation of p-aminohippurate and tetraethylammonium. At 10 umol/preincubation (2.4 mM), organic ion accumulation was decreased maximally by all bromobenzene metabolites examined while equimolar amounts of bromobenzene were without effect. 4-Bromocatechol was the most potent nephrotoxicant in vitro. Administration of 0.53-2.12 mmol/kg (iv) 4-bromocatechol to mice resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in renal function while hepatic function was altered only slightly at the higher doses. The renal cortical necrosis produced by in vivo administration of 4-bromocatechol could not be distinguished histologically from that induced by bromobenzene. These results demonstrate that 4-bromocatechol and the 3 bromophenol isomers are nephrotoxicants that can be generated from bromobenzene in mice.",

Marine algae and bryozoa are possible sources of bromophenols, including 4-bromophenol. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.12X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-bromophenol will exist solely as a vapor. Vapor-phase 4-bromophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.7 days. 4-Bromophenol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 4-bromophenol is expected to have low mobility based upon a Koc of 610. The pKa of 4-bromophenol is 9.17, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.51X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. A theoretical BOD of 0% using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test suggests that biodegradation is not an important fate process. If released into water, 4-bromophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. A BCF of 8.0 to 12 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 4-bromophenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-bromophenol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that general public may be exposed to 4-bromophenol via inhalation, ingestion of drinking water and fish, and dermal contact with products containing 4-bromophenol. (SRC)",

The pKa of 4-bromophenol is 9.17(4), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization of 4-bromophenol from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.51X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(6). 4-Bromophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 1.2X10-2 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(7).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.7 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 4-Bromophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). 4-Bromophenol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

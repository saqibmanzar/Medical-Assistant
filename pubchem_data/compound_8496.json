Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Safety of PET containers was evaluated with newly established detection methods for TPA, IPA, and DMT. Migration of the 3 monomers into food simulants (water, 4% acetic acid, 20% alcohol, and n-heptane) from 56 PET containers collected from open markets was monitored. Migrated monomers were not detected over 0.1 ppm of detection limit. The corresponding estimated daily intake was measured to confirm the safety of these publicly available PET containers and to permit comparison to the specific migration limit of the European Union. The estimated daily intake of 3 monomers migrating from PET was 0.0384 mg/kg each. This represented only 0.6% of the European Union's specific migration limit, confirming the safety of the examined containers.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Carboxylic acids with six or fewer carbon atoms are freely or moderately soluble in water; those with more than six carbons are slightly soluble in water. Soluble carboxylic acid dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Many insoluble carboxylic acids react rapidly with aqueous solutions containing a chemical base and dissolve as the neutralization generates a soluble salt. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Insoluble carboxylic acids react with solutions of cyanides to cause the release of gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymerization reactions; like other acids, they often catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions.",

It was concluded that the 5% dose level would not permit growth or even survival of the animals. Therefore, the doses were reduced to 3%. Levels of 1.6% (approximately 800 mg/kg-day) in feed produced small increases in the incidence of crystalluria (1/25 males, 2/25 females) and renal pathology (5/25 males).

Isophthalic acid occurs in atmospheric aerosols as a result of the photooxidation of anthropogenic compounds during long-range transport. There are industrially important esters of isophthalic acid such as dimethyl isophthalate that may undergo chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis to yield isophthalic acid. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.6X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isophthalic acid will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Its existence in the atmosphere in both phases has been observed experimentally. Vapor-phase isophthalic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 days. Particulate-phase isophthalic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Isophthalic acid absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isophthalic acid is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 79. Isophthalic acid is a dibasic (2 displaceable hydrogen atoms) acid whose pKa1 is 3.70 and pKa2 is 4.60 at 25 \u00b0C and will primarily exist in the anion form in the environment and form salts with cations in soil; anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. Also, volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Isophthalic acid may be susceptible to direct photolysis on the soil surfaces. Isophthalic acid is readily biodegradable in screening tests using sewage sludge and may be expected to biodegrade in soil. If released into water, isophthalic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Isophthalic acid may be susceptible to direct photolysis in surface waters. Isophthalic acid has been shown to be readily biodegradable in screening studies and is expected to biodegrade in natural water. Some potential for occupational exposure to isophthalic acid via the inhalation and dermal routes is possible during bag filling operations and while loading rail cars and trucks. The general population is exposed to isophthalic acid in atmospheric particulate matter. Occupation exposure would most likely occur via dermal contact. (SRC)",

Its existence in the atmosphere in both phases has been observed experimentally(3,4). Vapor-phase isophthalic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.3X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(5). Particulate-phase isophthalic acid may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Isophthalic acid absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(6), and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Under aerobic conditions and following OECD guideline 301B, approximately 9%, 46%, 64%, and 77% of isophthalic acid contained in sludge was degraded after 2, 5, 7, and 12 days, respectively(2). Isophthalic acid is degraded by aerobic microorganisms isolated from soil and marine sediment(3,4); cultures isolated from marine cultures also degraded isophthalic acid under anaerobic conditions(4). After an acclimation to an activated sludge inoculum over a 24 day period, 84% of isophthalate was consumed in a respiratory test(5). Isophthalic acid completely degraded in 8 days in a biodegradation test that used a soil inoculum(6). In another  screening test, 95% of COD was removed in 5 days using an acclimated activated sludge inoculum(7). In anaerobic biodegradation tests using granular and digested sewage sludge inoculum, isophthalic acid (as isophthalate) could be completely mineralized with a lag phase for 50% degradation ranging from 74 to 156 days(8). Using bacteria from river water as inocula (Songhua River, China) and a sealed-bottled method, isophthalic acid was found to be readily biodegradable with first-order rate constant of 1.43/day(9).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 12 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Isophthalic acid absorbs UV radiation >290 nm up until about 330 nm(2), and therefore it may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).

Isophthalic acid is a dibasic (2 displaceable hydrogen atoms) acid whose pKa1 is 3.70 and pKa2 is 4.60 at 25 \u00b0C(4); therefore isophthalic acid will be largely dissociated in the environment and form salts with cations(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It was identified in airborne particulate matter (prominent GC peak) from a suburban area 60 km northeast of Tokyo, Japan in April 1985(2). The ambient annual average concentration of isophthalic acid in fine particle organic compounds at four sites on a west to east trajectory, West Los Angeles, downtown Los Angeles, Pasadena, and Rubidouc for 1982 were 2.1, 3.4, 2.9 and 2.1 ng/cu m, respectively(3); 24-hr samples were collected at 6 day intervals throughout the year; the concentration of isophthalic acid at a background site on San Nicolas Island, west of Los Angeles, averaged <0.03 ng/cu m from July to December(3). A study was performed of the long-term transport of photochemical air pollution from coastal areas in Japan with large emission sources to inland mountains(4); the resulting mean concentration of isophthalic acid in airborne aerosols in a plume at Takasaki (July 26-31, 1986) and Karuizawa (July 29-31, 1986) was 2.2 and 1.3 ng/cu m, respectively(4). The ratio of carboxylic acids to acetylene (which is believed to be derived from the same sources) increased during the day and decreased at night and averaged 72% at Takasaki and 84% at Karuizawa, suggesting that isophthalic acid is almost entirely formed photochemically during long-term transport(4). Airborne particulate matter (PM2.5 fraction) collected from eight sites in the southeastern US in 1999 and 2000 contained isophthalic acid concentrations ranging from 0.21 to 0.73 ng/cu m(5). Samples of atmospheric particulate matter collected at 12 sites in southern California in 1995 were found to contain average isophthalic acid concentration ranges of 0.233 to 0.616 ng/cu m(6). The concentration of isophthalic acid in the particulate matter of air samples collected at Fresno and Bakersfield CA (Dec 26, 1995 to Jan 6, 1996) ranged from 1.89 to 3.41 ng/cu m(7).",

The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

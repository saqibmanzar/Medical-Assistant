When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is also used as a catalyst for phase transfer and is a key intermediate in the manufacture of pyrithione-based biocides for use in cosmetics and various pharmaceutical products. HUMAN STUDIES: Photo-treatment of 2-CPY produces genotoxic products discovered when tested in cultured human lymphocytes. ANIMAL STUDIES: Male albino rats were exposed to 2-CPY via inhalation at a concentration of approximately 6.05 mg/L for 6 hours. All animals died within 3 days after exposure.  Male and female rabbits were exposed to the undiluted 2-CPY dermally at concentrations of 40, 48, 50, 58, 63, 68, 79, 82 or 100 mg/kg. 2-CPY caused only transient local congestion of the skin when applied to either intact or abraded skin. The primary gross lesion observed was hemorrhagic necrosis of the liver. In rats, liver damage was the primary alteration caused by the inhalation of 2-CPY. In rat developmental studies there were no effects of treatment on mating performance, fertility or length of gestation. There was a slight decrease in pup survival. A bacterial reverse mutation assay was performed on Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 97, TA 98, TA 100, and TA 102, using concentrations of 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 mg/plate. The results were negative without metabolic activation, and positive with metabolic activation in all tester strains.",

Furthermore, it appears to be formed as a secondary pollutant during the decomposition of specific insecticides. As reported in our previous work, 2-CPY was readily removed and slowly mineralized when subjected to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at 254 nm. Moreover, 2-CPY was found to be genotoxic at 100 ug/mL but it was not genotoxic at or below 50 ug/mL. In this work 2-CPY aqueous solutions were treated by means of UV irradiation at 254 nm. 2-CPY mineralization history under different conditions is shown. 2-CPY was found to mineralize completely upon prolonged irradiation. Identified products of 2-CPY photolytic decomposition are presented. Solution genotoxicity was tested as a function of treatment time. Aqueous solution samples, taken at different photo-treatment times were tested in cultured human lymphocytes applying the cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assay. It was found that the solution was genotoxic even when 2-CPY had been practically removed. This shows that photo-treatment of 2-CPY produces genotoxic products. Upon prolonged irradiation solution genotoxicity values approached the control value.",

During exposure, rats were observed for signs of toxicity and mortality continuously for 1 hour and at 1/2 hour intervals thereafter until the end of the exposure period. After the exposure period, the rats were observed daily for 14 days. A necropsy was performed on all rats. All animals died within 3 days after exposure. Observations during exposure included hypoactivity, sedation and ataxia. At the end of 4 hours of exposure, all rats were prostrate. Three rats exhibited dyspnea. Three rats died between 4 and 6 hours of the exposure period. At the end of 6 hours the surviving rats were prostrate, comatose and dyspneic. Within 24 hours, 2 additional rats died. The remaining 5 rats were still prostrate and comatose. Clear ocular discharge was noted. Within the following 24-hour period after exposure, 4 more rats died. The tenth rat died at 3 days post exposure.

The concentration of 2-chloropyridine was monitored continuously during the exposure by infrared spectrophotometry. The degree and character of organic damage resulting from exposure to the test substance were the presence of gross pathologic or histopathologic lesions, hematologic alterations, organ weight changes and changes in the blood chemistry. Liver, kidney, spleen, heart, lungs and brain were examined for weight changes and together with pancreas and adrenals for the presence of histologic lesions. Hematologic studies consisted of erythrocyte, leukocyte and differential counts and hematocrit and hemoglobin determinations. Parameters used to detect changes in blood chemistry were blood urea nitrogen, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and serum glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase. Rats were observed for 2 weeks post-exposure. LC50 >/= 100 ppm but < 250 ppm. The concentration of 2-chloropyridine vapor was within 7% of the desired concentration throughout the exposure period. Liver damage was the primary alteration caused by the inhalation of the test article. Histopathologic examinations revealed that the test substance caused central lobular necrosis, hemorrhage and fatty degeneration as well as cellular infiltration. The extent and type of damage varied with the exposure.

Each dose level was prepared in a concentration that enabled the delivery of a constant volume of 1.0 mL/100 g of body weight. ... Food was withheld from all rats for 16 hours prior to dosing. Food and water were available ad libitum at all other times. Rats were observed for signs of toxicity and mortality continuously for 4 hours post-dose, at 24 hours post dose and once daily thereafter for 13 days. At the termination of the 14-day observation period, surviving rats were sacrificed. Necropsies were performed on all rats. LD50 - 342 mg/kg (confidence limits - 211-558 mg/kg). At 16 hours post-dose, 4 rats in the 100 mg/kg dose group exhibited nasal porphyrin. At 24 hours post-dose, 4 rats appeared hypoactive. All animals appeared normal thereafter until study termination. Two rats in the 215 mg/kg dose group exhibited nasal porphyrin discharge at 4 hours post-dose. At 24 hours post-dose 4 rats were ataxic, sedate, hypoactive and displayed nasal porphyrin discharge. At 2 days all rats were hypoactive and continued to demonstrate nasal discharge. One animal was found dead on day 3. The remaining rats appeared normal throughout the remainder of the observation period. Within 6 hours 5 rats from the 464 mg/kg dose group exhibited ataxia and hypoactivity. One rat became prostrate. At 24 hours all rats were ataxic and exhibited nasal porphyrin. One rat was prostrate and dyspneic. At 2 days 1 rat died and 2 were ataxic and the remaining 3 appeared hypoactive. At 3 days all 5 rats were hypoactive and appeared depressed. At 4 days one died and the remaining 4 continued to be hypoactive and became hypersensitive to touch. Two more rats died on days 5 and 6. The remaining 2 rats were hypoactive and hypersensitive to touch. A fifth rat died. The remaining rat recovered and appeared normal from days 9 through 14. Rats in the 681, 1000, 1470 and 2150 mg/kg dose groups displayed hypotonia, ataxia, sedation, hypnosis, loss of righting reflex, pinna and placing reflexes, bradypnea, dyspnea, cyanosis, ptosis, salivation and reduced pain responses within 2 to 18 hours post-dose. Rats in all dose groups except the 681 mg/kg dose group died within 2 to 4 hours post-dose. Rats in the 681 mg/kg dose group died within 3 days. At necropsy, 1 rat in the 100 mg/kg dose group had hydronephrosis. The rat that died in the 215 mg/kg dose group exhibited a pale liver with friable accentuated lobules and the lungs were congested. Necropsy findings in the rats that died in the 464 mg/kg dose group included congested lungs, congested liver, hemorrhages of the stomach, small intestines and urinary bladder and icterus. All rats in the 100, 215 and 464 mg/kg dose groups that survived to the 14-day post-exposure period had essentially normal necropsy findings. Necropsy findings in the 681, 1000, 1470 and 2150 mg/kg dose groups included scrotal erythema, hemorrhages of the stomach, intestines and urinary bladder and congested lungs and liver. Hydronephrosis (unilateral and bilateral) was scattered in all groups.",

It is also used as a catalyst for phase transfer and is a key intermediate in the manufacture of pyrithione-based biocides for use in cosmetics and various pharmaceutical products. o-Chloropyridine is available in purified (99%), technical (95%), or crude (80%) grades. o-Chloropyridine was nominated for testing by the NTP based on increasing production and use as a site-limited pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediate, the potential for occupational and environmental exposures during its manufacture, its persistence in the environment (lasting longer than 6 months), evidence of mutagenicity based on results of several short-term test systems, and suspicion of carcinogenicity based on effects associated with structurally related chemicals. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1/N mice received o-chloropyridine (99% pure) dermally for 2 weeks or in drinking water for 3 months. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. In the 2-week dermal studies, groups of five male and five female rats and mice were administered o-chloropyridine in ethanol 5 days per week over a 16-day period (12 dose days) at doses of 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 mg o-chloropyridine/kg body weight. Vehicle control animals were administered ethanol alone. A constant concentration of test chemical per dose concentration was administered to each animal at volumes of 0.5 mL/kg body weight for rats and 2 mL/kg for mice. All dosed rats and mice survived to the end of the studies. The mean body weights of all dosed groups of rats and mice were similar to those of the vehicle control groups. Liver weights of 50 and 100 mg/kg male rats were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. No gross or microscopic lesions were considered related to o-chloropyridine administration.",

It is also used as a catalyst for phase transfer and is a key intermediate in the manufacture of pyrithione-based biocides for use in cosmetics and various pharmaceutical products. o-Chloropyridine is available in purified (99%), technical (95%), or crude (80%) grades. o-Chloropyridine was nominated for testing by the NTP based on increasing production and use as a site-limited pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediate, the potential for occupational and environmental exposures during its manufacture, its persistence in the environment (lasting longer than 6 months), evidence of mutagenicity based on results of several short-term test systems, and suspicion of carcinogenicity based on effects associated with structurally related chemicals. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1/N mice received o-chloropyridine (99% pure) dermally for 2 weeks or in drinking water for 3 months. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. ... In the 3-month toxicity studies, groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1/N mice were exposed to o-chloropyridine in drinking water at concentrations of 0, 10, 30, 100, 300, or 1,000 ppm (equal to average daily doses of approximately 1, 3, 9, 25, and 65 mg o-chloropyridine/kg body weight to male rats, 1, 3, 9, 27, and 70 mg/kg to female rats, 1.5, 4.5, 15, 41, and 110 mg/kg to male mice, and 1.3, 4, 12, 38, and 92 mg/kg to female mice) for 3 months. Additional groups of 10 male and 10 female rats designated for clinical pathology testing were exposed to the same concentrations for 22 days.  All rats survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of male and female rats exposed to 1,000 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls. Water consumption by the 1,000 ppm rats was less than that by the control groups during the first week of the study. In the 1,000 ppm groups, thinness was noted in seven of 10 male rats and all female rats on day 8, likely due to dehydration, and also in five of 10 male rats on day 64. The absolute and relative (except 100 ppm) right kidney weights of all exposed groups of male rats and of groups of female rats (>/= 30 ppm) were greater than controls. Absolute and relative liver weights of male rats (>/= 100 ppm) and female rats (>/= 30 ppm) were significantly greater than those of the control groups. Epididymal sperm counts were significantly lower in male rats exposed to 1,000 ppm, indicating that o-chloropyridine exhibits the potential to be a reproductive toxicant. In the liver of male rats, the incidence of clear cell focus (1,000 ppm) and the incidences and severities of hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolization (>/= 300 ppm) were significantly higher. The incidence of hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolization was significantly greater in female rats also (1,000 ppm). There were also several low-magnitude histologic and hematologic responses in male and female rats suggesting an erythron effect characterized by a decreased erythron (>/= 300 ppm males and females) with a compensatory erythropoietic response: increased reticulocyte counts (>/= 300 ppm males, 1,000 ppm females) and hematopoietic cell proliferation in the spleen (>/= 300 ppm males, 1,000 ppm females). Splenic congestion (1,000 ppm males, 10 ppm and >/= 100 ppm females) was also observed and may have been related to the erythron effect. There were no treatment-related deaths in either sex of mice. The final mean body weight and mean body weight gain of 1,000 ppm male mice were significantly less than those of the control group; the mean body weight gain of 300 ppm female mice was significantly greater than that of the controls. Water consumption by the 1,000 ppm groups was less than that of the control groups during the first week of the study. The liver weights of all exposed groups of male mice and of 300 and 1,000 ppm female mice and the kidney weights of 1,000 ppm males (relative) and females (absolute and relative) were significantly greater than those of the controls. The incidences of hepatocyte centrilobular hypertrophy were significantly increased in the 300 and 1,000 ppm groups of male and female mice, with exposure concentration-related increases in severity. An erythron effect, similar to that observed in rats, was observed in 1,000 ppm female mice only and was characterized by a small decrease in hematocrit value, hemoglobin concentration, and erythrocyte count; no accompanying erythropoietic response was observed in mice.",

It is also used as a catalyst for phase transfer and is a key intermediate in the manufacture of pyrithione-based biocides for use in cosmetics and various pharmaceutical products. o-Chloropyridine is available in purified (99%), technical (95%), or crude (80%) grades. o-Chloropyridine was nominated for testing by the NTP based on increasing production and use as a site-limited pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediate, the potential for occupational and environmental exposures during its manufacture, its persistence in the environment (lasting longer than 6 months), evidence of mutagenicity based on results of several short-term test systems, and suspicion of carcinogenicity based on effects associated with structurally related chemicals. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1/N mice received o-chloropyridine (99% pure) dermally for 2 weeks or in drinking water for 3 months. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. ... o-Chloropyridine was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 when tested with exogenous metabolic activation enzymes from rat or hamster liver; no mutagenic activity was observed in the absence of metabolic activation. In vivo, no increases in the frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were observed in peripheral blood of male or female mice exposed to o-chloropyridine for 3 months in drinking water.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.18 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-chloropyridine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-chloropyridine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 62 days. 2-Chloropyridine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-chloropyridine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 120. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Chloropyridine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 2-Chloropyridine volatilized 37% from soil incubated at 28 \u00b0C for 64 days. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0.5% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, 2-chloropyridine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 and 22 days, respectively. BCFs of <20 measured in fish suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2-chloropyridine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-chloropyridine is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population is not likely to be exposed to 2-chloropyridine. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 2-chloropyridine is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 2.5 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 22 days(SRC). 2-Chloropyridine's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 2-chloropyridine from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1). 2-Chloropyridine volatilized 37% from soil incubated at 28 \u00b0C for 64 days(4).",

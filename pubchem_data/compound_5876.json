For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

They interact with specific intracellular receptor proteins in target tissues to alter the expression of corticosteroid-responsive genes. Glucocorticoid-specific receptors in the cell cytoplasm bind with steroid ligands to form hormone-receptor complexes that eventually translocate to the cell nucleus. There these complexes bind to specific DNA sequences and alter their expression. The complexes may induce the transcription of mRNA leading to synthesis of new proteins. Such proteins include lipocortin, a protein known to inhibit PLA2a and thereby block the synthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and PAF. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the production of other mediators including AA metabolites such as COX, cytokines, the interleukins, adhesion molecules, and enzymes such as collagenase. /Glucocorticoids/"

In addition, corticosteroids may potentiate replication of some organisms contained in live, attenuated vaccines and supraphysiologic dosages of the drugs can aggravate neurologic reactions to some vaccines. Routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should generally be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued. Administration of live virus or live, attenuated vaccines, including smallpox vaccine, is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive dosages of glucocorticoids. In addition, if inactivated vaccines are administered to such patients, expected serum antibody response may not be obtained. The Public Health Service Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) state that administration of live virus vaccines usually is not contraindicated in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy as short-term (less than 2 weeks) treatment, in low to moderate dosages, as long-term alternate-day treatment with short-acting preparations, in maintenance physiologic dosages (replacement therapy), or if corticosteroids are administered topically, ophthalmically, intra-articularly, bursally, or into a tendon. If immunization is necessary in a patient receiving corticosteroid therapy, serologic testing may be needed to ensure adequate antibody response and additional doses of the vaccine or toxoid may be necessary. Immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients receiving nonimmunosuppressive doses of glucocorticoids or in patients receiving glucocorticoids as replacement therapy (e.g., Addison's disease). /Corticosteroids/"

Another study reported 2 cases of cleft palate in 86 births. Occurrence of cleft palate in these studies is higher than in the general population but could have resulted from the underlying diseases as well as from the steroids. Other fetal abnormalities that have been reported following glucocorticoid administration in pregnant women include hydrocephalus and gastroschisis. Women should be instructed to inform their physicians if they become or wish to become pregnant while receiving glucocorticoids. If glucocorticoids must be used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking one of these drugs, the potential risks should be carefully considered. /Corticosteroids/"

Manufacturers state that glucocorticoid oral inhalation therapy should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections. Patients whose susceptibility to infection is high, such as those receiving glucocorticoids as immunosuppressive therapy, are especially likely to develop secondary infections. Patients receiving glucocorticoids who are potentially immunosuppressed should be warned of the risk of exposure to certain infections (e.g., chickenpox, measles) and of the importance of obtaining medical advice if such exposure occurs. Since glucocorticoid therapy can reactivate tuberculosis, treatment of latent tuberculosis infection should be included in the regimen of patients with a history of active tuberculosis undergoing prolonged glucocorticoid therapy. If glucocorticoids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary. Use of glucocorticoids in patients with active tuberculosis should be restricted to those with fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which glucocorticoids are used in conjunction with appropriate antimycobacterial chemotherapy. Manufacturers state that glucocorticoid oral inhalation therapy should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with clinical or asymptomatic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract. Since glucocorticoids can reactivate latent amebiasis, any patient who has been in the tropics or who has unexplained diarrhea should be evaluated for amebiasis to exclude these patients prior to initiating therapy. In the treatment of acute or disseminated tuberculosis, glucocorticoids should only be used as part of a total antituberculosis regimen. ... /Corticosteroids/"

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In Denmark, the product is used for insect control in apples and pears. Mode of action is to prevent mating of codling moths and several species of leaf wrappers, whereby propagation is prevented. That results in a reduced moth (leaf rollers) population and therefore less damage to the ... /crops/. The product has not previously been selected by the Danish EPA for control of content of active substances.",

In Denmark, the product is used for insect control in apples and pears.  It is registered for pesticide use in the U.S. but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. 1-Tetradecanol has been tested as experimental medication in controlling the progression of chronic periodontal disease. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Thirty-one patients allergic to Hirudoid cream were patch tested with the ingredients. 29 were allergic to the cream base and 16 to one or more components. The most common allergens were for 1-tetradecanol, cetostearyl alcohol, and parabens. It has been stated that 1-tetradecanol should not be patch tested at 10% in petrolatum, but at a lesser concentration, due to irritant properties.  ANIMAL STUDIES: It has been reported that 1-tetradecanol causes no skin irritation and slight eye irritation.",

A saturated solution of melatonin in a mixture of water and ethanol (40:60) containing 5% w/v of saturated fatty alcohol was used in the skin permeation studies using Franz diffusion cells. For skin irritation studies, 230 uL of fatty alcohol solution was applied on the dorsal surface of the hairless rats using Hill top chamber. The skin irritation was evaluated by visual scoring method and bioengineering methods such as measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin blood flow. The flux of melatonin across hairless rat skin was found to be dependent on the carbon chain length of the fatty alcohols, with decanol showing the maximum permeation of melatonin. All fatty alcohols increased the TEWL and skin blood flow significantly compared with the vehicle. The fatty alcohols (decanol, undecanol and lauryl alcohol), which showed greater permeation of melatonin, also produced greater TEWL, skin blood flow and erythema. Tridecanol and myristyl alcohol showed lower permeation enhancement effect but caused greater skin irritation. Octanol and nonanol may be the most useful enhancers for the transdermal delivery of melatonin considering their lower skin irritation and a reasonably good permeation enhancement effect. ...",

Contact dermatitis to specified medicaments was diagnosed in 40 of 408 patients with a positive patch test, and to standard allergens of medicament nature in a further 123 patients. Medicament contact allergy therefore constituted 40% of all allergies observed. This is equivalent to an annual incidence of 43/100,000. Among responsible products the leading antigens were ethylenediamine, phenylbutazone, myristyl alcohol, chlorocresol and cincocaine. In comparison with patients having other contact allergies the present material of medicament contact allergy was characterized by a rather high mean age (57 years), a higher percentage of males, a higher percentage of lower leg and anogenital dermatitis, and a lower percentage of hand dermatitis. A secondary spread occurred in half the cases of lower leg and anogenital dermatitis.",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate sensitization to 10 frequently used MWF components, which are not part of the established MWF test series, in metalworkers with suspected occupational dermatitis due to MWF. PATIENTS/METHODS: Oleyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, dimethylolurea, 4,4'-methylenebis morpholine, imazalil, 1-amino-2-propanol (monoisopropanolamine; MIPA), 2-amino-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol (AEPD), 2,5-bis(n-octyldithio)-1,3,4-thiadiazole, zinc alkyl dithiophosphate and dibenzyl disulfide have been patch tested in 144 patients. RESULTS: 7 patients reacted positively to the formaldehyde releaser 4,4'-methylenebis morpholine, and 6 of these patients also reacted to formaldehyde and/or other formaldehyde releasers. 4 patients reacted positively to myristyl alcohol tested at 10% petrolatum (pet.). Additionally, 20 doubtful or irritant reactions occurred. 1 patient each reacted positively to oleyl alcohol, MIPA, and AEPD. None of the other test substances mentioned above elicited any clear-cut positive reaction. Patch testing with well-known MWF allergens showed proportions of positive reactions, which were comparable to those from other studies, e.g. 11% to monoethanolamine, 8% to colophonium and 3%-5% to various preservatives. CONCLUSIONS: 4,4'-methylenebis morpholine may be an important MWF allergen, although clinical relevance could not be stated definitely in every case. Myristyl alcohol should not be patch tested at 10% pet., but at a lesser concentration, due to irritant properties.",

A saturated solution of melatonin in a mixture of water and ethanol (40:60) containing 5% w/v of saturated fatty alcohol was used in the skin permeation studies using Franz diffusion cells. For skin irritation studies, 230 uL of fatty alcohol solution was applied on the dorsal surface of the hairless rats using Hill top chamber. The skin irritation was evaluated by visual scoring method and bioengineering methods such as measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin blood flow. The flux of melatonin across hairless rat skin was found to be dependent on the carbon chain length of the fatty alcohols, with decanol showing the maximum permeation of melatonin. All fatty alcohols increased the TEWL and skin blood flow significantly compared with the vehicle. The fatty alcohols (decanol, undecanol and lauryl alcohol), which showed greater permeation of melatonin, also produced greater TEWL, skin blood flow and erythema. Tridecanol and myristyl alcohol showed lower permeation enhancement effect but caused greater skin irritation. Octanol and nonanol may be the most useful enhancers for the transdermal delivery of melatonin considering their lower skin irritation and a reasonably good permeation enhancement effect. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.1X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-tetradecanol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-tetradecanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 hours. 1-Tetradecanol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-tetradecanol is expected to have no mobility based upon Koc values of 18,197-34,674 in humic acid. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.04X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 1-Tetradecanol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A biodegradation half-life of 5.5 days was calculated for 1-tetradecanol, based on a rate constant of 52.5 1/hr measured in sludge indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 1-tetradecanol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon Koc values of 23,320-64,060 in suspended solids. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 17 hours and 10 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 20-55 months if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 190 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1-tetradecanol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-tetradecanol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-tetradecanol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and beverages, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 1-tetradecanol.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.04X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 17 hours and 10 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 20-55 months if adsorption is considered(5). 1-Tetradecanol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 190(SRC), from its log Kow of 6.03(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC).

Vapor-phase 1-tetradecanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 1-Tetradecanol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

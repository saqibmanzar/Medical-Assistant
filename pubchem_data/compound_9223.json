This resin resists corrosion and is used to make paints and varnishes. The resin also provides water resistance and is used in coatings on paper products and fabrics. It is used as an adhesive in food containers and some asphalt floor tiles. The resin has been approved for use in food packages and as a coating on citrus fruits. We do not know how often the resin is used or whether any 2,3-benzofuran in the coating or packaging gets into the food.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This resin resists corrosion and is used to make paints and varnishes. The resin also provides water resistance and is used in coatings on paper products and fabrics. It is used as an adhesive in food containers and some asphalt floor tiles. The resin has been approved for use in food packages and as a coating on citrus fruits. We do not know how often the resin is used or whether any 2,3-benzofuran in the coating or packaging gets into the food.",

Workers continuously exposed to wood varnished with coumaroneindene resin developed dermatitis, but the sensitivity was attributed to the sulfuric acids in the varnish.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.44 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzofuran will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzofuran will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 10 hours and 6 days, respectively. Benzofuran absorbs light in the environmental UV spectrum (absorption max = 285 nm); thus it has the potential for direct photolysis. If released to soil, benzofuran is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 680. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.3X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, benzofuran is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Benzofuran has been shown to biodegrade in the presence of creosote-adapted microorganisms. In a study using aerobic groundwater microcosms, benzofuran at 3.3 mg/l degraded completely after 95 days (lag period = 70 days) from an aquifer contaminated with creosote compounds while from a background aquifer, benzofuran degraded after 285 days (lag period = 278 days). Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 5 days, respectively. A BCF of 360 for guppies suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to benzofuran may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzofuran is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzofuran via inhalation of vapor and particulates containing benzofuran that are released in exhausts from combustion processes such as gasoline and diesel engines, and waste incineration.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.3X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), a BCF of 360 for guppies(6), suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Benzofuran has been shown to biodegrade in the presence of creosote-adapted microorganisms(SRC). Benzofuran biodegraded using a enriched culture from a creosote contaminated site(7) where biodegradation of benzofuran was enhanced by the degradation of other creosote compounds(7). Benzofuran was completely removed in combination with toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene, naphthalene, 1-methylnapthalene within the first 12 days of incubation, compared with a 7% loss in the acidified control microcosm(7). After 27 days, complete removal of benzofuran was observed in combination with other primary creosote substituents except 1-methylnapthalene where 95% removal was observed(7). In a study using aerobic groundwater microcosms, benzofuran at 3.3 mg/l degraded completely after 95 days (lag period = 70 days) from an aquifer contaminated with creosote compounds while from a background aquifer, benzofuran degraded after 285 days (lag period = 278 days)(8).",

Vapor-phase benzofuran is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 37X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Vapor-phase benzofuran is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone(4); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 6 days(SRC). Benzofuran absorbs light in the environmental UV spectrum (absorption max = 285 nm)(5); thus it has the potential for direct photolysis(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Benzofuran biodegraded using a enriched culture from a creosote contaminated site(1) where biodegradation of benzofuran was enhanced by the degradation of other creosote compounds(1). Benzofuran was completely removed in combination with toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene, naphthalene, 1-methylnapthalene within the first 12 days of incubation, compared with a 7% loss in the acidified control microcosm(1). After 27 days, complete removal of benzofuran was observed in combination with other primary creosote substituents except 1-methylnapthalene where 95% removal was observed(1). In a study using aerobic groundwater microcosms, benzofuran at 3.3 mg/l degraded completely after 95 days (lag period = 70 days) from an aquifer contaminated with creosote compounds while from a background aquifer, benzofuran degraded after 285 days (lag period = 278 days)(2).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Sorption of creosote compounds (including benzofuran) were measured on natural clayey till soil column(4). A Kd of 1.4 l/kg was measured for benzofuran (in presence of other creosote compounds) with a time for 50% breakthrough on the column nearly equivalent to non-adsorbing bromide ions (e.g., 37 days)(4).

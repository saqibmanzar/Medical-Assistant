PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Methyl stearate is found naturally as a flavor component of some foods. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.36X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl stearate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl stearate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 hours. Particulate-phase methyl stearate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, methyl stearate is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 62,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.016 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Methyl stearate is expected to rapidly biodegrade in aerobic soils based on the results of screening studies. If released into water, methyl stearate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Methyl stearate is expected to rapidly biodegrade in aerobic waters based on the results of screening studies. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 160 hours, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is estimated to be about 61 hours ignoring adsorption; when considering maximum adsorption the volatilization half-life increases to 17 months. An estimated BCF of 29 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. An estimated base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 0.030 L/mole-sec corresponds to half-lives of 7.3 years and 266 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to methyl stearate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl stearate is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to methyl stearate due to its occurrence in some foods. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.016 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 164 hours, respectively(SRC), using an estimation method(3). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is estimated to be about 61 hours ignoring adsorption; when considering maximum adsorption the volatilization half-life increases to 17 months(5). According to a classification scheme(5), a /an estimated BCF of W29(SRC), from a log Kow of 8.35(10) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Methyl stearate is expected to rapidly biodegrade in aerobic waters based on screening study results(8). An estimated base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 0.030 L/mole-sec(9,SRC) corresponds to half-lives of 7.3 years and 266 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(9).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as approximately 5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as approximately 164 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond 2 m deep is estimated to be about 61 hours ignoring adsorption; when considering maximum adsorption the volatilization half-life increases to 17 months(3). Methyl stearate's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur although adsorption may attenuate this process(SRC).

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

With a typical batch process, the toluene is fed into the nitrator and cooled to about 25 \u00b0C. The nitrating acid (52-56 wt% H2SO4, 28-32 wt% HNO3, and 12-20 wt% H2O) is added slowly below the surface of the toluene and the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 25 \u00b0C by adjusting the feed rate of the nitrating acid and the amount of cooling. After all of the acid is added, the temperature is raised slowly to 35-40 \u00b0C. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is put into a separator where the spent acid is withdrawn from the bottom and is reconcentrated. The crude product is washed in several steps with dilute caustic and then water. The product is steam distilled to remove excess toluene and then dried by distilling the remaining traces of water. The resulting product contains 55-60 wt% o-nitrotoluene, 3-4 wt% m-nitrotoluene, and 35-40 wt% p-nitrotoluene. The yield of mononitrotoluenes is about 96%. ... The separation of the isomers is carried out by a combination of fractional distillation and crystallization.",

Toxic by all routes (inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this bitter-almond-smelling, yellowish liquid may occur from its use in the manufacture of toluidine, tolidine, fuchsine, azo dyes, sulfur dyes, rubber chemicals, and agricultural chemicals. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, headache, weakness, dizziness, nausea, shortness-of-breath, tachycardia, and methemoglobinemia.  The onset of symptoms may be delayed up to 4 hours.  OSHA has set a time-weighted-average (TWA) limit of 2 ppm as a final rule to become effective December 31, 1992. Local exhaust ventilation should be applied to control airborne 2-nitrotoluene to permissible limits. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur,wear a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and chemical protective clothing which is specifically recommended by the shipper or manufacturer. If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. Contaminated clothing should be removed and left at the site for cleaning. While 2-nitrotoluene does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of irritating or poisonous gases.  Also, containers of this substance may explode violently in the heat of a fire. For fires involving 2-nitrotoluene, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or standard foam. Fight fire from as far a distance as possible, and if fire is advanced, evacuate the area. Dike fire control water.  2-Nitrotoluene should be stored in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area, away from sources of ignition, strong oxidizers, and sulfuric acid.  For small spills of 2-nitrotoluene, take up with vermiculite, dry sand, or earth and place into containers for later disposal. Large spills on land should be diked far ahead of the spill and not allowed to enter water sources or sewers.  Spills into bodies of water should be trapped at the bottom with sand bag barriers and removed with suction hoses, or treated with activated carbon and the resulting immobilized masses removed with mechanical dredges or lifts.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

During one batch, failure of the agitator caused increase in temperature and at 15 C the temperature monitor stopped addition of nitrotoluene and increased cooling, the temperature rose to 20 C and the building was evacuated. After the liberation of reaction heat had subsided, the agitator was used very intermittently to assist cooling and mixing. At 12 C full agitation was restored and processing continued to completion. Similar caution is necessary during the preparation of other analogous nitrobibenzyls.",

Livers were removed and analyzed for total and covalently bound radiolabel. Maximal concentrations of total radiolabel were observed between 3 and 12 hr after the dose, and there were no large differences among the 3 isomers in peak concentrations achieved. Covalent binding to hepatic macromolecules was maximal 12 hrs after administration for all 3 isomers. Thereafter, concentration of covalently bound 2-nitrotoluene derived material were always 2-6 times higher than those of 3- or 4-nitrotoluene derived material. When DNA was isolated from livers of rats given mononitrotoluene isomers 12 hrs previously, only 2-nitrotoluene was observed to covalently bind at concentrations above the limits of detection of the assay. The covalent binding of 2-nitrotoluene, but not that of 3- or 4-nitrotoluene, to both total hepatic macromolecules and DNA was markedly decreased by prior administration of pentachlorophenol or 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol. Covalent binding to hepatic DNA was decreased by >96%. Thus, 2-nitrotoluene, but not 3- or 4-nitrotoluene, induces DNA excision repair. Furthermore, 2-nitrotoluene, like the hepatocarcinogen 2,6-dinitrotoluene, may require the action of sulfotransferase for its conversion to a species capable of covalently binding to hepatic DNA.",

The estimated daily doses based on measures of feed consumption were 40 to 900 mg nitrotoluene/kg body weight/day for rats ... and were similar for each of the 3 isomers when compared for each dietary level/sex/species. There were no effects on survival in any of the studies, and clinical signs of toxicity were limited to decreases in feed consumption. Decreased body weight gains occurred in dosed rats ... in all studies at the higher dose levels and were most pronounced in rats receiving o-nitrotoluene.  In rats, histopathologic analyses after 13 weeks of dosing showed toxicity to kidney, spleen, and testis in animals receiving any of the 3 isomers, and toxicity to the liver and mesothelium in male rats given o-nitrotoluene. Kidney toxicity observed in male rats was characterized by the presence of hyaline droplets in tubular epithelial cells, attributed to an increase in the level of a-2u globulin. Pigment, possibly lipofuscin, and karyomegaly in the p-nitrotoluene study were present in the renal tubular epithelium of dosed male and female rats. In the spleen of treated male and female rats, there was a mild increase in hematopoiesis, hemosiderin deposition, and/or congestion; this effect was most severe with the para-isomer, followed by the ortho- and then the meta-isomer. Administration of o-, m-, or p-nitrotoluene impaired testicular function of the rat, shown by degeneration of the testis and reduction in sperm concentration, motility, and spermatid number. All 3 isomers increased the length of the estrous cycle in rats. Hepatic toxicity was characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization and oval cell hyperplasia and by an increase in the level of serum bile acids, SDH, and ALT activities in male rats given o-nitrotoluene. There was no histopathologic evidence for liver toxicity in male or female rats with the m- or p-isomers, or in female rats with the o-isomer; but evidence of liver injury was observed in these groups, indicated by increases in relative liver weights and elevations in bile acids and liver enzymes in serum. Mesotheliomas of the tunica vaginalis were observed in 3/10 male rats receiving o-nitrotoluene at 5000 ppm, and mesothelial cell hyperplasia was observed in 2/10 male rats receiving o-nitrotoluene at 10000 ppm.",

All 2,500 and 5,000 ppm males died before the end of the study. Survival of 1,250 ppm males and 5,000 ppm females was significantly less than that of the controls. Mean body weights of exposed males and 5,000 ppm females were generally less than those of the controls throughout the study, and those of 2,500 ppm females were less during the second year of the study. Feed consumption by 5,000 ppm males was less than that by the controls. Three urinary metabolites were followed during the study as biomarkers of exposure. The ratios of o-nitrobenzoic acid to creatinine determined at 2 weeks and at 3, 12, and 18 months were linearly related to exposure concentration in males and females. The concentrations of o-nitrobenzylmercapturic acid and o-aminobenzoic acid were below the limit of quantitation at most time points. The incidences of hemangiosarcoma in all exposed groups of males and in 5,000 ppm females were significantly greater than those in the controls. Large intestine (cecum) carcinomas were observed in all exposed groups except 5,000 ppm males. The incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms were significantly increased in 2,500 and 5,000 ppm females. Nonneoplastic liver lesions including eosinophilic and basophilic foci and minimal to mild necrosis were enhanced in exposed males and females. Also present were focal hepatocyte syncytial alteration in exposed males and hepatocyte necrosis and focal hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolization in 5,000 ppm females. Renal tubule pigmentation occurred more frequently in exposed groups of males and in 5,000 ppm females than in the controls. Olfactory epithelial degeneration occurred in every male and female mouse exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm, and the severity of this lesion increased with increasing exposure concentration.",

                                                    "String": "2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: In the core study, groups of 60 male and 60 female rats were fed diets containing 625, 1,250, or 2,000 ppm o-nitrotoluene (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 25, 50, or 90 mg o-nitrotoluene/kg body weight to males and 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg to females) for 105 weeks. In a 3-month stop-exposure study, groups of 70 male rats were fed diets containing 2,000 or 5,000 ppm o-nitrotoluene (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 125 or 315 mg/kg) for 13 weeks followed by undosed feed for the remainder of the study. A group of 70 male rats receiving undosed feed served as a control group for both male rat studies; 60 female rats receiving undosed feed were the control group for the female core study. Ten control males and 10 males from each stop-exposure group were sacrificed at 3 months. All 2,000 ppm core study, all 5,000 ppm stop-exposure, and all but three core study 1,250 ppm male rats died before the end of the studies. Survival of 625 ppm core study and 2,000 ppm stop-exposure males and of 2,000 ppm females was significantly less than that of the controls. Mean body weights of all exposed groups of males except the 625 ppm group were generally less than those of the controls throughout the study. Mean body weights of 2,000 ppm females were less than those of the controls during year 2 of the study. Feed consumption by exposed groups of rats was similar to that by the controls. Three urinary metabolites were followed during the study as biomarkers of exposure. The ratios of o-nitrobenzoic acid to creatinine and of o-nitrobenzylmercapturic acid to creatinine determined at 2 weeks and at 3, 12, and 18 months were linearly related to exposure concentration in males and females. The ratio of o-aminobenzoic acid to creatinine was not related to exposure concentration. The incidences of malignant mesothelioma in male rats occurred with positive trends in both the core and stop exposure studies and were significantly greater in exposed groups than in the controls. Incidences of subcutaneous skin neoplasms (fibroma, fibrosarcoma, and lipoma) were increased in exposed groups of males, while the incidences of fibroma or fibrosarcoma (combined) were increased in exposed females. In all exposed groups of males and females except 2,000 ppm core study males, the incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma were significantly increased. The incidences of mammary gland hyperplasia were significantly increased in 625 and 1,250 ppm females. Increased incidences of mesothelioma, skin neoplasms, and mammary gland fibroadenoma in the stop-exposure males indicated that 3 months of dosing were sufficient to produce a carcinogenic effect. Liver weights of 5,000 ppm stop-exposure males were significantly greater than those of the controls at 3 months. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in 2,000 ppm core study males and females and of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 2,000 ppm core study and 5,000 ppm stop-exposure males were significantly increased. Cholangiocarcinoma occurred in three 5,000 ppm stop-exposure males, and a single hepatocholangiocarcinoma occurred in a 625 ppm male and in a 2,000 ppm core study male. Nonneoplastic lesions of the liver included eosinophilic, mixed cell, and clear cell foci in exposed groups of males and females and mixed cell infiltrate in exposed males and basophilic focus in exposed females. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly increased in 5,000 ppm stop-exposure males, as were alveolar/bronchiolar hyperplasia in most exposed groups of males and females. The incidences of hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen and of hyperplasia of the mandibular lymph node (females) and bone marrow were increased in exposed groups of males at 3 months and/or 2 years and in exposed groups of females at 2 years. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were significantly decreased in all groups of males exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and in all exposed groups of females; the incidence of testicular interstitial cell adenoma was significantly decreased in 5,000 ppm stop exposure males.",

(10 animals/chemical/species/sex/dose) in the feed at concentrations between 625 and 10000 ppm. The estimated daily doses based on measures of feed consumption were 40 to 900 mg nitrotoluene/kg body weight/day for rats ... and were similar for each of the 3 isomers when compared for each dietary level/sex/species. There were no effects on survival in any of the studies, and clinical signs of toxicity were limited to decreases in feed consumption. Decreased body weight gains occurred in dosed rats ... in all studies at the higher dose levels and were most pronounced in rats receiving o-nitrotoluene.  In rats, histopathologic analyses after 13 weeks of dosing showed toxicity to kidney, spleen, and testis in animals receiving any of the 3 isomers, and toxicity to the liver and mesothelium in male rats given o-nitrotoluene. Kidney toxicity observed in male rats was characterized by the presence of hyaline droplets in tubular epithelial cells, attributed to an increase in the level of a-2u globulin. Pigment, possibly lipofuscin, and karyomegaly in the p-nitrotoluene study were present in the renal tubular epithelium of dosed male and female rats. In the spleen of treated male and female rats, there was a mild increase in hematopoiesis, hemosiderin deposition, and/or congestion; this effect was most severe with the para-isomer, followed by the ortho- and then the meta-isomer. Administration of o-, m-, or p-nitrotoluene impaired testicular function of the rat, shown by degeneration of the testis and reduction in sperm concentration, motility, and spermatid number. All 3 isomers increased the length of the estrous cycle in rats. Hepatic toxicity was characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization and oval cell hyperplasia and by an increase in the level of serum bile acids, SDH, and ALT activities in male rats given o-nitrotoluene. There was no histopathologic evidence for liver toxicity in male or female rats with the m- or p-isomers, or in female rats with the o-isomer; but evidence of liver injury was observed in these groups, indicated by increases in relative liver weights and elevations in bile acids and liver enzymes in serum. Mesotheliomas of the tunica vaginalis were observed in 3/10 male rats receiving o-nitrotoluene at 5000 ppm, and mesothelial cell hyperplasia was observed in 2/10 male rats receiving o-nitrotoluene at 10000 ppm.",

The acute toxicity was evaluated by bacterium bioluminescence assay using a freshwater luminescent bacterium (Vibrio qinghaiensis sp. Nov.) and a marine luminescent bacterium (Photobacterium phosphoreum). The results showed that the wastewater's biodegradability was poor due to the high amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD). The main organic components were dinitrotoluene sulfonates (DNTS) with small amount of TNT, dinitrotoluene (DNT), mononitrotoluene (MNT) and other derivatives of nitrobenzene. It was highly toxic to luminescent bacteria P. phosphoreum and V. qinghaiensis sp. Nov. After reaction time of 15 min, the relative concentration of toxic pollutants (expressed as reciprocal of dilution ratio of wastewater) at 50% of luminescence inhibition ratio was 5.32x10(-4) for P. phosphoreu, while that was 4.34x10(-4) for V. qinghaiensis. V. qinghaiensis is more sensitive and suitable for evaluating the wastewater's acute toxicity than P. phosphoreum. After adsorption by resin, the acute toxicity can be greatly reduced, which is helpful for further treatment by biological methods.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.85X10-1 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-nitrotoluene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-nitrotoluene  will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 23 days. 2-Nitrotoluene is also expected to undergo direct photolysis, with 2-methyl-6-nitrophenol and 2-methyl-4-nitrophenol being its primary photoproducts. If released to soil, 2-nitrotoluene is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 370. Field monitoring at a munition factory site found that 2-nitrotoluene migrated large distances in the subsurface soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.25X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation screening tests have shown that 2-nitrotoluene can degrade very slowly in unacclimated media such as the Japanese test or a 64-day silt loam soil inoculum test. However, biodegradation in acclimated media (activated sludge, soil, water) can be relatively fast with 98-100% degradation within a few days or two weeks. If released into water, 2-nitrotoluene is expected to adsorb moderately to suspended solids and sediment based upon its estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 85 hours and 30 days, respectively. Measured BCF values of 6.6-29.9 in carp fish suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-nitrotoluene may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-nitrotoluene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-nitrotoluene via inhalation of ambient air in the vicinity of production sites and ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

Mononitrotoluenes can be formed in the ambient atmosphere by reaction of toluene and photochemically produced nitrate radicals. If released to air, vapor pressures of 0.0157-0.185 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicate the mononitrotoluenes will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase mononitrotoluene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17-23 days. The mononitrotoluenes are also expected to undergo direct photolysis with methyl-nitrophenols being its primary photodegradates. If released to soil, mononitrotoluenes are expected to have high to moderate mobility based upon a measured Koc value of 138 and an estimated Koc value of 370. Field monitoring at a munition factory site found that nitrotoluene isomers can migrate large distances in the subsurface soils. Volatilization of mononitrotoluenes from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur slowly given a Henry's Law constant range of 5.63X10-6 to 1.25X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Mononitrotiluenes are not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon their vapor pressures. The mononitrotoluenes are susceptible to direct photolysis, therefore, photodegradation may occur on surfaces exposed to sunlight. Biodegradation screening tests have shown that mononitrotoluenes can degrade very slowly in tests using unacclimated media such as the Japanese MITI test or a 64-day silt loam soil inoculum test. However, biodegradation in acclimated media can be relatively fast with 98-100% degradation within a few days or two weeks. If released into water, mononitrotoluenes are expected to have little to moderate adsorption  to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be slow based upon the Henry's Law constants. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.6-7.8 days and 30-60 days, respectively. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since these compounds lack functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Measured BCF values of 0.47-29.9 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. In aqueous solution, the mononitrotoluenes have quantum yields of 0.0046-0.0158 at 313 nm indicating that they are susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight, with a half-life of less than 32 hours near the water surface. Occupational exposure to the mononitrotoluenes may occur through dermal contact with these compounds at workplaces where mononitrotoluenes are produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to mononitrotoluenes via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

Field monitoring at a munition factory site found that nitrotoluene isomers can migrate large distances in the subsurface soils(4). Volatilization of mononitrotoluenes from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur slowly(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant range of 5.63X10-6 to 1.25X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(5). Mononitrotoluenes are not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure range of 0.0157-0.185 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(6). The mononitrotoluenes are susceptible to direct photolysis(7,8), therefore, photodegradation may occur on surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC). Biodegradation screening tests have shown that mononitrotoluenes can degrade very slowly in tests using unacclimated media such as the Japanese MITI test(9) or a 64-day silt loam soil inoculum test(10).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be slow(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant range of 5.63X10-6 to 1.25X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.6-7.8 days and 30-60 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), BCF measured values of 0.47 to 29.9 in fish(7,8) suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since these compounds lack functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). In aqueous solution, the mononitrotoluenes have quantum yields of 0.0046-0.0158 at 313 nm(9) indicating that they are susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight with a half-life of less than 32 hours near the water surface(9). The photolysis rate constant in pure water for 3-nitrotoluene in near surface water at latitude 40 deg N has been experimentally determined to be 6.5 L/days which corresponds to a half-life of 0.11 days(10). Biodegradation screening tests have shown that mononitrotoluenes can degrade very slowly in test using unacclimated media such as the Japanese MITI test(7) or a 64-day silt loam soil inoculum test(11). However, biodegradation in acclimated media can be relatively fast with 98-100% degradation within a few days or two weeks(12-14). Based on monitoring data, the half-life of the mononitrotoluene isomers in a river 4 to 5 meters deep has been estimated to be 2.7 to 3.2 days(15).",

Vapor-phase mononitrotoluenes are degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17-23 days(SRC), calculated from their rate constants of 7X10-13 to 9.5X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that were derived using a structure estimation method(3) or measured(4).

Other evidence supports complete aerobic degradation of 10 mg/L 2-nitrotoluene within 2 weeks when incubated in adapted aerobic composite river sediment and sewage sludges(3). When nitrotoluene-adapted activated sludges were used as an inoculum, however, 2-nitrotoluene (200 mg/L) was almost completely degraded (i.e. 98% removal) within 5 days when incubated at 20 \u00b0C(3). The screening studies using unadapted sludges gave similar results as the MITI test, and 2-nitrotoluene is confirmed to be non biodegradable according to the standard MITI test. Using a mixed culture isolated from a contaminated soil (near an ammunition plant), 2-nitrotoluene (at initial concentrations of 3.5 mg/L) degraded completely in 8 days in aerobic batch and continuous reactor tests(4).",

A persistence study examining the fate of m- and p-nitrotoluenes in aerobic groundwater demonstrated biodegradation within 14 days(5). Using a mixed culture isolated from a contaminated soil (near an ammunition plant), mononitrotoluene isomers (at initial concentrations of 3.5-12 mg/L) degraded completely in 1-8 days in aerobic batch and continuous reactor tests(6). Other evidence supports complete aerobic degradation of 10 mg/L mononitrotoluene isomers within 2 weeks when incubated in adapted aerobic composite river sediment and sewage sludges(7).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life range of about 17-23 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). Mononitrotoluene are not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). In aqueous solution, the mononitrotoluenes have quantum yields of 0.0046-0.0158 at 313 nm(4) indicating that they are susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC) with a half-life of less than 32 hours near the water surface(4). Irradiation (at > 300 nm) of mononitrotoluene vapor in air for 5 hrs resulted in loss of most of the mononitrotoluenes present(5). Photolysis of the mononitrotoluenes in sunlight yields methyl-nitrophenol isomers as the primary photodegradates(5). The mid-day half-life of o-nitrotoluene in Aucilla River, FL water due to indirect photolysis has been calculated to be 45 minutes using an experimentally determined reaction rate constant of 0.92 1/hr(6); the Aucilla River water contains a high concentrations of humic substances that increase photodegradation rates(6). The photolysis rate constant in pure water for 3-nitrotoluene in near surface water at latitude 40 deg N has been experimentally determined to be 6.5 L/days which corresponds to a half-life of 0.11 days(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

These Henry's Law constants indicate that the mononitrotoluenes are expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2).

The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated to range from 30-60 days(SRC). Mononitrotoluene's Henry's Law constants indicate that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

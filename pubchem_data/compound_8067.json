Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

This technique is particularly useful to study aromatic, conjugated, and other substances containing a pi bond.  Modern ultraviolet spectrophotometers also cover the visible light range, in which case the technique is called ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

HUMAN STUDIES: Potential symptoms of overexposure include headache, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, dermatitis, skin sensitization, and irritation of eyes, skin, nose, throat, and respiratory system. ANIMAL STUDIES: No skin irritation was reported in rabbits after a 24 hr exposure, but marked eye irritation in rabbits lasted for 3 days. A range-finding study found inhalation of 2000 ppm for 4 hr killed two to four rats out of six exposed. In rats, amyl mercaptan produced stomach ulcers and adrenal gland damage at dosages that cause 70-100% mortality in 5 days.",

Its use as an odorant in gas lines to locate leaks will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 13.8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-amyl mercaptan will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-amyl mercaptan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hours. n-Amyl mercaptan absorbs UV light at wavelength 210 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm. If released to soil, n-amyl mercaptan is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 130. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data in soil or water where not available. If released into water, n-amyl mercaptan is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 30 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to amyl mercaptan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-amyl mercaptan is produced or used. Use data suggest that the general population may be exposed via ingestion of foods containing n-amyl mercaptan as a flavoring. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase n-amyl mercaptan is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.6X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). n-Amyl mercaptan absorbs UV light at wavelength 210 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

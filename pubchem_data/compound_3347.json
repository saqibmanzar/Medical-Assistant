The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The cleavage of the ester linkage in fenvalerate yielding two metabolites was found to be primary step in the biodegradation of fenvalerate in rat organs. These metabolites were purified to homogeneity by HPLC and characterized by infra-red spectroscopy as 4-chloro-alpha-(1-methylethyl) benzeneacetic acid and 3-phenoxy benzoic acid.",

Four days after the dermal application, the highest concentration of fenvalerate residues was found in the adrenal gland, followed by the biceps muscle, omental fat, liver, kidney, lung and cerebrum in that order.

The administered radioactivity, except that of the cyano-labelled compounds, is readily excreted (up to 99% in 6 days). The major metabolic reactions are ester cleavage and hydroxylation at the 4' position. Various oxidative and conjugation reactions that lead to a complex mixture of products have been shown to occur. When studies were carried out with fenvalerate radiolabelled in the cyano group, elimination of the radioactive dose was less rapid (up to 81% in 6 days). The remaining radioactivity was retained mainly in the skin, hair, and stomach as thiocyanate. A minor, but very important, metabolic pathway is the formation of a lipophilic conjugate of (2R)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)isovalerate. This congugate, which is implicated in the formation of granuloma, has been detected in the adrenals, liver mesenteric lymph nodes of rats, mice, and some other species.",

Both compounds and their metabolites did not transfer readily from the maternal blood to the fetus, the amount of (14)C transferred being less than 0.07% of the dose. There were no substantial differences in the fetal (14)C level and the transfer ratio ((14)C tissue level/(14)C maternal blood level) between both labeled preparations. Major (14)C-compounds in the fetus, maternal blood and placenta were the parent compounds, CPIA (2-(4-chlorophenyl)isovaleric acid) and CPIA-hydroxylated derivatives and there was no qualitative difference in metabolic fates between the two compounds, except that a trace amount of CPIA-cholesterol ester (cholesteryl (2R)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)isovalerate] was detected in the maternal blood and placenta only with fenvalerate. CPIA-cholesterol ester did not seem to transfer from the maternal blood to the fetus. Overall, esfenvalerate and fenvalerate seem to behave in the same manner as far as placental transfer was concerned.",

However, a small portion of the insecticidally active compounds or its derivatives are absorbed, as shown by their toxicity and their effect on the liver. Pyrethriods may also be absorbed following inhalation or dermal contact. They are rapidly distributed to most tissues, particularly to those with a high lipid content, and are concentrated in central and peripheral nervous tissues. Pyrethriods or their metabolites are not known to be stored in the body or to be excreted in the milk, but no study of the matter has employed modern methods. The major metabolic pathways for pyrethriods are hydrolysis of the central ester bond, oxidative attacks at several sites, and conjugation reactions, to produce a complex array of primary and secondary water-soluble metabolites that undergo urinary excretion. Metabolism is believed to involve nonspecific microsomal carboxyesterases and microsomal mixed function oxidases, which are located in nearly all tissue types, with particularly high activities in the liver. Metabolites are excreted in the urine and faeces. (L857, L889)",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Phosphoinositide breakdown was determined from inositol-phosphate formation by tritiated inositol labeled synaptoneurosomes. All five pyrethroids dose dependently induced phosphoinositide breakdown. Type II pyrethroids exhibited higher potency and deltamethrin was more efficacious than the Type I pyrethroids. Five uM tetrodotoxin, a blocker of voltage dependent sodium channels, partially inhibited deltamethrin (85 percent) and fenvalerate (60 percent) responses but not allethrin or resmethrin. Fenvalerate induced stimulation of phosphoinositide was additive with stimulation elicited by the receptor agonists carbamylcholine (1 mM) and norepinephrine (1000 uM) but less than additive with the sodium channel agents batrachotoxin, pumiliotoxin-B, and scorpion venom. Allethrin (100 uM) was less than additive with receptor agonists or sodium channel agents and actually significantly inhibited response to scorpion venom. Effects for 100 uM allethrin with either fenvalerate or deltamerthrin were not different from allethrin alone. Ten uM allethrin slightly decreased response to 10 to 100 uM deltamethrin. The local anesthetic dibucaine, a sodium channel activation inhibitor, completely blocked deltamethrin induced phosphoinositide breakdown but was much less effective in inhibiting allethrin response. It appears likely that Type I pyrethroids induce phosphoinositide breakdown through a mechanism other than sodium channel activation while Type II pyrethroids act in a manner analogous to other sodium channel agents.",

A paired stimulus approach was used. All eight prolonged the depression of granule cells excitability that follows stimulation of their major synaptic input, the perforant path. The magnitude of this effect depended upon the class to which the pyrethroid belonged. Type I pyrethroids (those primarily producing tremor) prolonged the depression of granule cell excitability for shorter periods than did type II pyrethroids (those primarily producing salivation and choreoathetosis) or pyrethroids producing a mixed type of intoxication. No overlap was found between groups. To determine whether the difference observed between type I and type II pyrethroids was the result of an infelicitous selection of doses, cismethrin (type I) was tested over a dose range of 1.5-24 times the conscious rat iv LD50. Even at the highest dose, the prolongation remained well below that produced by type II pyrethroids. The effect of deltamethrin was shown to be consistent with the production or potentiation of a surmountable inhibitory response. This action of deltamethrin was antagonizable by mephenesin and lidocaine, but not by picrotoxin or halothane. The type of effect, its time course, and the anatagonism data suggest that type II pyrethroids enhance inhibition in the dentate gyrus. This action does not appear to be mediated by GABA receptors.",

The GABA activated chloride channel has been shown to be modulated by general anesthetics, alcohols, and the pyrethroid, cyclodiene and lindane insecticides. The general anesthetics halothane, enflurane and isoflurane greatly augmented the GABA activated current before desensitization took place, and suppressed it after desensitization at clinically relevant concn equivalent to 1-2 minimum alveolar concn. The stimulating effect appears to be a mechanism of general anesthesia. It seems that general anesthetics have a specific affinity for the GABA receptor-channel complex. Ethanol also augmented the GABA activated peak chloride current with little or no effect on the desensitized sustained current. Longer chain alcohols n-butanol, n-hexanol, n-octanol, and n-decanol also exerted the same type of effect, with the potency and efficacy increasing with lengthening of the carbon chain. The GABA receptor-channel complex has also been shown to be an important target site of certain insecticides. The type II pyrethroids deltamethrin and fenvalerate augmented the GABA activated peak chloride current when applied concurrently with GABA, but the effect was diminished as the pyrethroids were applied for long periods of time prior to GABA application. The latter effect might explain the controversy in the literature regarding the pyrethroid action on the GABA system. The type I pyrethroid allethrin suppressed the GABA activated peak chloride current when co-applied with GABA. Both types of pyrethroids suppressed the N-methyl-d-aspartate induced current. Lindane and the cyclodienes dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor epoxide, and isobenzan suppressed the GABA activated chloride current. These effects can account for the convulsant action of lindane and the cyclodienes.",

Of 573 dermal or ingestion poisoning cases in China, 51 patients had disturbed consciousness and 34 had seizures. Of those, only five were occupationally exposed. Seizures are more commonly related to exposures to fenvalerate, flucythrinate, cypermethrin, deltapermethrin, and fluvalinate. Seizures have not been reported after exposure to permethrin. Pyrethroids may also cause paresthesias after skin contact. Paresthesias (stinging and numbness) usually begin 1-2 hours after contact and resolve within 24 hours.

Use the rinsewater as a pesticide, following label directions. Replace the cap or closure securely. Dispose of the container according to label instructions.

They are incompatible with acids; mixing nitriles with strong oxidizing acids can lead to extremely violent reactions. Nitriles are generally incompatible with other oxidizing agents such as peroxides and epoxides. The combination of bases and nitriles can produce hydrogen cyanide.

They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. They also inhibit calium channels and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase. (T10, T18, L857)",

If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. In case of eye exposure, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes.

Seventy-two pregnant female rats served as subjects.

Behavioral evaluations were conducted on half the pups in each litter and the other pups were used for the neurochemical assays. Behavioral evaluations included locomotor activity, screen testing, and passive avoidance learning. Brains for neurochemical analysis were extracted and sectioned into frontal cortex, caudate, hippocampus and cerebellum. Neurochemical assays assessed levels of DA, DOPAC, 5-HIAA, 5-HT, HVA, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, GABA, and taurine. Diazepam treatment did produce some neurotoxicity in the control pups but diazepam exposure did reverse elevations in amino acid levels in the cerebellum produced by both pyrethroids. In addition diazepam reversed the pyrethroid effects on activity and muscular coordination. These diazepam effects were not specific to Type I or Type II pyrethroids.",

Thirty-six female rats were mated and exposed to various pyrethroid formulations by oral gavage from the first gestational day until their pups (culled to 8/litter) were 12 days old. Six mothers were exposed daily to one of the following treatments: corn oil control, corn oil+96% xylene, 1.25 mg/kg Pydrin (pesticidal ingredient fenvalerate), 0.125 mg/kg Pydrin, 4.0 mg/kg Ambush (pesticidal ingredient permethrin), or 0.4 mg/kg Ambush. Behavioral evaluations of locomotor activity, muscular coordination and passive avoidanc learning were conducted on half of the pups from each litter (N = 24 pups/treatment condition). The other pups were sacrificed, brains were removed and sectioned into frontal cortex, hippocampus, caudate, and cerebellum for neurochemical assessment. The monoamines DA, DOPAC, 5-HIAA, 5-HT and HVA levels were determined and the amino acids aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, GABA, and taurine were determined for each of the brain regions. Gestational duration was shortened by exposure to the high doses of Pydrin and Ambush but only pups from the 4.0 mg/kg Ambush group were significantly lighter. No physical malformations were observed in pups from any of the treatment conditions, although the high Pydrin exposure condition resulted in a 4% death rate. Behavioral changes were seen for both locomotor activity and muscular coordination. The shape of across-session habituation of locomotion was different for the xylene and corn oil and the high dose Ambush groups. Both groups were less active on day 1 and more active on days 2 and 3 than the other pups. The high doses of Ambush and Pydrin produced slower intrasession habituation. Muscular coordination was improved slightly following low dose exposure to both pesticides and reduced following high dose exposures. Regional brain weights were normal for the cortex, cerebellum and caudate but the hippocampus was 64% heavier for pups treated with 4.0 mg/kg Ambush. Amino acid determinations indicated that the cerebellum was most affected where glutamate, glutamine, aspartate and taurine were reduced following xylene or pyrethroid exposure. The biogenic amine transmitter 5-HT was reduced in several brain regions following pyrethroid exposures. These data suggest that levels of Ambush and Pydrin as low as the LD50/10,000 can alter behavior and neurotransmitter functioning.",

Treatment consisted of 10% of the median lethal dose of each insecticide given orally for the single dosing investigations and 5% of the median lethal dose was given orally for 5 consecutive days as repeated doses. Weight losses in both body and organ were noted only after repeated dose of dimethoate. Significant decreases in the activity of kynurenine-3-hydroxylase, kynurenine-2-oxoglutarate-transaminase, kynurenine-pyruvate-transaminase, and pyridoxal-phosphokinase were noted following repeated administration of dimethoate. Carbaryl in repeated doses caused significant decreases in the activity of apo-tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, kynurenine-2-oxoglutarate-transaminase, kynurenine-pyruvate-transaminase, and serine-glyoxylate-transaminase. An inhibition was noted in tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase following external addition of insecticides at different concn to an incubation mixture. Other enzymes demonstrated no change in their activities following this treatment.",

Applications of 0.05 mL fenvalerate formulated to field strength (0.13 mg/sq cm) were made to a 4 sq cm area of earlobe on five occasions, the opposite earlobe receiving distilled water. Participant evaluation after each application continued for 48 hr and involved description of the cutaneous sensations. Each participant was treated after each application with one of the remaining compounds. Fenvalerate (like the other pyrethroids) induced skin sensations. The paresthesia developed with a latent period of approximately 30 min, peaked by 8 hr, and deteriorated as early as 24 hr. The local application of dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate markedly inhibited the occurrence of skin sensations.",

The results showed that in all treatments, the daily average number of eggs per female ladybird was about 40-55. Ladybirds pretreated with imidacloprid by contact and feeding methods, and with rotenone by feeding method produced significantly fewer eggs, compared with control. But the accumulative oviposition of ladybirds pretreated with 6 insecticides at sublethal level was no significant differences, compared with untreated ladybirds. The hatching rates of the eggs laid by ladybirds pretreated with 6 insecticides by two methods were all lower than that of control. The accumulative survivals from egg to pupal stage of all treatments decreased significantly. The developmental duration from egg to pupa of those treated with imidacloprid by two methods and with fenvalerate by contact method prolonged significantly, while that of those treated with rotenone by two methods and with fenvalerate, abamectin, pirimicarb, and azadirachtin by feeding method shortened obviously, but that of those treated with rotenone and abamectin by contact method had no differences with control. After the eggs were immersed with sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid, rotenone, fenvalerate and abamectin, the successful hatching rates were all lower than that of control, and the development periods prolonged clearly. The 1st instar larval survival rates of those treated with fenvalerate decreased significantly, and the survivals from 2nd instar larval to pupal stage also reduced to some extent. The total developmental duration of those treated with rotenone and fenvalerate prolonged significantly. These findings suggested that the effects of insecticides at low doses on the fecundity of ladybird were very complicated. The class, action mode, toxicity and exposure route of insecticides could affect the results of experiments.",

We exposed embryos and larvae of five amphibians (the frogs Rana sylvatica, Rana pipiens, Rana clamitans; the toad Bufo americanus; the salamander Ambystoma maculatum) to one or both of the pyrethroid pesticides permethrin and fenvalerate. Concentrations ranged from 0.01 ppm to 2 ppm, and exposures lasted 22 or 96 hr. No significant mortality of embryos, anuran tadpoles, or salamander larvae occurred during or following exposure to pyrethroids. However, tadpole growth was delayed following exposure, and tadpoles and salamander larvae responded to prodding not by darting away but by twisting abnormally. Both effects may result in greater vulnerability to predation. Recovery of normal avoidance behavior occurred more rapidly at 20 than at 15 \u00b0C and following exposure to lower concentrations of the pesticides, indicating both temperature and dose effects. Tadpoles exposed later in development did not feed for a period of days following exposure but were still capable of metamorphosis. Of the five tested species, Ambystoma maculatum, a tadpole predator, was particularly sensitive. An amphibian community is therefore likely to be sensitive to low-level contamination events.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.5X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates fenvalerate will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase fenvalerate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Thin films of fenvalerate on glass exhibited an initial photodegradation half-life of 4 days when exposed to sunlight and therefore it may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Photodegradation in UV light yields 3-phenoxybenzoyl cyanide and 3-phenoxybenzyl cyanide. If released to soil, fenvalerate is expected to have no mobility based upon a Koc of 5,300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Using a mineral and an organic soil, 92-98% of applied fenvalerate degraded after an 8-week incubation period, suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, fenvalerate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. A biodegradation half-life of 34 days using sediment and seawater inoculum suggests that biodegradaton may be an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF range of 570 to 1,100 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. The average half-life in southern US forests where the compound was been used in silviculture applications is 35 days with loss attributed to photodegradation, biodegradation and hydrolysis. Research indicates that hydrolysis of pyrethroid compounds is restricted to alkaline pH and generally results in polar products such as acids and aldehydes; these are expected to be more soluble than the neutral parent compounds. Occupational exposure to fenvalerate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where fenvalerate is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to fenvalerate via ingestion of food and via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 1.5X10-9 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 2.4X10-2 mg/L(5). According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF range of 570 to 1,100(7) suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Research indicates that hydrolysis of pyrethroid compounds is restricted to alkaline pH and generally results in polar products such as acids and aldehydes; these are expected to be more soluble than the neutral parent compounds(8). A biodegradation half-life of 34 days using sediment and seawater inoculum(7) suggests that biodegradaton may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Thin films of fenvalerate on glass exhibited an initial photodegradation half-life of 4 days when exposed to sunlight(3) and therefore it may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

In degradation tests using an activated sludge inoculum, the aerobic degradation rate of fenvalerate was 50-72% faster than in sterile controls(2); addition of a glucose medium to cometabolize the non-sterile flasks resulted in a 6-fold increase in the degradation rate(2). The aerobic (semi-open system, activated sludge inocula) biodegradation rate of fenvalerate was determined in tests using both inoculated and non-inoculated (control) experiments(3); the biodegradation half-life was determined to be 13 days(3). In seawater and seawater-sediment microcosm studies, the half-life of fenvalerate was determined to be 14-17 days in non-sterile systems and 33-41 days in sterile systems suggesting a presence of microbial activity(4). Through the application of an aquatic ecosystem model, fenvalerate added at concentrations of 5 and 25 ug/L, exhibited aquatic biodegradation half-lives of 3.5-4.3 days using moderately polluted river water (pH 7.7, dissolved oxygen 1.5 mg O2/L, 126 mg CaCo3/L; sand, carp, maintained at 15-19 \u00b0C)(5).",

Research indicates that hydrolysis of pyrethroid compounds is restricted to alkaline pH and generally results in polar products such as acids and aldehydes; these are expected to be more soluble than the neutral parent compounds(2). The alkaline hydrolysis rate constant fenvalerate (optical isomer) in 1:1 dioxane water at 25 \u00b0C was measured as 0.182 L/mol-sec(3) which corresponds to respective half-lives of 440 days, 44 days and 4.4 days at pHs of 7, 8 and 9(SRC); the alkaline hydrolysis rate constant in 1:1 dioxane water at 20 \u00b0C was measured as 0.149 L/mol-sec(3). Pyrethroids absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore fenvalerate may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Photodegradation in UV light yields 3-phenoxybenzoyl cyanide and 3-phenoxybenzyl cyanide(4). Photodegradation half-lives ranging from 1.8 to approximately 18 days on three Japanese soils exposed to September outdoor sunlight conditions have been reported(5). Also reported are photodegradation half-lives of 14 days, 2-4 days, and 8 days on kidney bean leaf, spring wheat leaf, and cotton leaf, respectively(5).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

Log BCF values of 2.61 and 2.96, corresponding to BCFs of 407 and 912, respectively, in rainbow trout were reported(2). According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). In a 28 day laboratory study, a steady-state BCF of 4,700 was measured in eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica)(1). In a 30 day aquatic ecosystem study, fenvalerate BCFs of 100 for fish, 491 for snails and 412 for algae were measured(1); relatively low residues in the organisms were attributed to metabolism, especially by the fish(1). The presence of dissolved organic matter (concentration of 6.7 mg/L) may enhance bioconcentration in Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) by up to a factor of 300(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

During a 5-yr period from 1982-1986, the US FDA's Los Angeles District Laboratory analyzed 19,581 samples of domestic and imported food and feed commodities for pesticide residues(3); fenvalerate was detected in 25 samples at concentrations of 0.05-1.0 ppm(3). For fiscal years 1988 and 1989, 27,065 food samples were collected and analyzed for pesticide residues by 10 state laboratories (CA, NY, FL, IN, MA, MI, NC, OR, VA and WI)(4); fenvalerate was detected in 54 samples (concentrations not reported)(4). According to compiled results of the US Food and Drug Administration's pesticide residue monitoring programs in domestic infant and adult foods for fiscal years 1985-1991, fenvalerate was detected as a pesticide residue in 11 of 2,464 apple samples, maximum residue 0.19 ppm and in 1 of 571 pear samples, maximum residue 0.08 ppm(5). Fenvalerate was not detected in 234 items making up diets of 8 population groups as a result of an FDA Total Diet Study conducted from July 1986 through April 1991(6). A US Food and Drug Administration 1992-1993 survey of 710 domestic and 949 imported pears resulted in detection of fenvalerate in two domestic samples at a maximum concentration of 0.08 ppm and one imported sample at 0.05 ppm; a survey of 1,219 domestic and 144 imported tomatoes resulted in detection of fenvalerate in three domestic samples at a trace concentration; it was not detected in imported tomato samples(7). A US Food and Drug Administration 1993-1994 survey of 769 domestic and 1,062 imported apples resulted in detection of fenvalerate in one imported sample at 0.81 ppm; it was not detected in domestic samples(8).",

The NOES Survey does not include farm workers. Occupational exposure to fenvalerate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where fenvalerate is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to fenvalerate via ingestion of food and via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound(SRC).",

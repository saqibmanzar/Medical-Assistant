Emesis or vomiting is controlled by the vomiting centre in the medulla region of the brain, an important part of which is the chemotrigger zone (CTZ). The vomiting centre possesses neurons which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Motion sickness principally involves overstimulation of these pathways due to various sensory stimuli. Hence the action of buclizine which acts to block the histamine receptors in the vomiting centre and thus reduce activity along these pathways. Furthermore since buclizine possesses anti-cholinergic properties as well, the muscarinic receptors are similarly blocked.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

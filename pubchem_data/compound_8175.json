Uremic toxins can be subdivided into three major groups based upon their chemical and physical characteristics: 1) small, water-soluble, non-protein-bound compounds, such as urea; 2) small, lipid-soluble and/or protein-bound compounds, such as the phenols and 3) larger so-called middle-molecules, such as beta2-microglobulin. Chronic exposure of uremic toxins can lead to a number of conditions including renal damage, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.\nDecanal is an organic compound with the chemical formula C9H19CHO. It is the simplest ten-carbon aldehyde. Decanal occurs naturally and is used in fragrances and flavoring. Decanal occurs in nature and is an important component in citrus along with octanal, citral, and sinensal. Decanal is also an important component of buckwheat odour .",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

These compound are formed as the partial oxidation products of the reaction between disinfectants (particularly ozone) and naturally occurring organic matter. Various full-scale and pilot treatment plants in North America that employ ozonation were surveyed using these techniques, which showed a trend toward both malonaldehyde and dialdehyde formation. Once formed, aldehydes can persist in the water and their concentrations may even increase following postdisinfection. An effective means of aldehyde removal appears to be the use of biologically active granular activated carbon filters, whose filtration mode determines the actual degree of removal. Dialdehydes require a slower filtration rate for their removal than formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. /C1-C10 Aldehydes/",

Aldehydes can react with air to give first peroxo acids, and ultimately carboxylic acids.

The main use of decanal is for citrus tones and for the manufacture of synthetic citrus oils. In addition, the C10 aldehydes have value as intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and in the polymer and pesticide fields. In the aircraft cabin, decanal was produced in the presence of ozone from surface reactions with occupants and their clothing, consistent with the inference that occupants were responsible for the removal of >55% of the ozone in the aircraft cabin. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Decanal was cytotoxic to Hela cells with IC50 less than 20 ug/mL. ANIMAL STUDIES: Decanal demonstrated antifungal and bactericidal properties. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Decanal did not significantly affect survival or hatching success of the brine shrimp Artemia salina.",

Increased levels of uremic toxins can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species. This seems to be mediated by the direct binding or inhibition by uremic toxins of the enzyme NADPH oxidase (especially NOX4 which is abundant in the kidneys and heart) (A7868). Reactive oxygen species can induce several different DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which are involved in the silencing of a protein known as KLOTHO.  KLOTHO has been identified as having important roles in anti-aging, mineral metabolism, and vitamin D metabolism. A number of studies have indicated that KLOTHO mRNA and protein levels are reduced during acute or chronic kidney diseases in response to high local levels of reactive oxygen species (A7869). ",

Combinations of 5-nitro-2-furaldehyde with semi-carbazide and of 2-hydrazinopyridine with pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde, which can react in situ to form antimicrobial hydrazones, demonstrated greater degrees of synergism against the intracellular pathogen, Salmonella typhimurium, at pH 5 relative to pH 7.4. Combinations are more selectively toxic at pH 5 (vs pH 7.4) than individual precursors and preformed hydrazone products because acid catalysis of hydrazone formation plays a role only for the combinations. A combination of decanal and N-amino, N'-octylguanidine (AOG) exhibited more pronounced synergistic cytolytic activity against erythrocytes in 0% serum than in 1% serum. Serum protein binding of decanal inhibited the formation of the more cytotoxic hydrazone, N-decylidenimino,N'-1-octylguanidine (DIOG), from the less cytotoxic AOG and decanal, and serum protein binding of DIOG prevented this cytotoxin from reaching the cell membrane. Because decanal binding cannot play a role in the cytotoxicity of preformed DIOG, it was less selective for cells in 0% serum than the combination of AOG and decanal. The pH 5 and 0% serum environments represent very simple models for macrophage phagolysosomal compartments and poorly vascularized solid tumor interiors respectively. If environment-selective synergism can be used as a basis for target-selective synergism in other in vitro model systems and in vivo, self-assembling combinations could provide a basis for rational introduction of target-selective synergism into chemotherapeutic drug design.",

By contrast, no lysis was observed after 20 hours with either decanal (56 microM) or AOG (100 microM) alone. The pronounced synergism observed for these chemicals and similar reactive pairs of chemicals is due to the self-assembly of more cytotoxic hydrazones in situ. Decanal and AOG also exhibit synergistic activity against cultured human cells (HeLa) and bacteria (Escherichia coli J96). This synergism may be useful in the design of cytotoxins that would self-assemble selectively from nontoxic precursors within tumors, while sparing normal tissue.",

Two separate groups of 16 females were each exposed to four conditions: low air exchange (4.4 (hr-1)), <2 ppb ozone; low air exchange, 61-64 ppb ozone; high air exchange (8.8 hr(-1)), <2 ppb ozone; and high air exchange, 73-77 ppb ozone. The addition of ozone to the cabin air increased the levels of identified byproducts from approximately 70 to 130 ppb at the lower air exchange rate and from approximately 30 to 70 ppb at the higher air exchange rate. Most of the increase was attributable to acetone, nonanal, decanal, 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA), 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO), formic acid, and acetic acid, with 0.25-0.30 mol of quantified product volatilized per mol of ozone consumed. Several of these compounds reached levels above their reported odor thresholds. Most byproducts were derived from surface reactions with occupants and their clothing, consistent with the inference that occupants were responsible for the removal of >55% of the ozone in the cabin. The observations made in this study have implications for other indoor settings. Whenever human beings and ozone are simultaneously present, one anticipates production of acetone, nonanal, decanal, 6-MHO, geranyl acetone, and 4-OPA.",

The A. flavus population that produces small sclerotia (S strain) has been implicated as the culprit for persistent aflatoxin contamination in field crops. We investigated how the plant volatile decanal, a C10 fatty aldehyde, affected the growth and development of the S strain A. flavus. Decanal treatment yielded fluffy variants lacking sclerotia and conidia and exhibiting a dosage-dependent radial colony growth. We used RNA-Seq analysis to examine transcriptomic changes caused by decanal and after removal of decanal. Mature sclerotia contained only 80% of the total transcripts detected in all samples in comparison to 94% for the decanal treated culture. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that decanal treatment increased expression of genes involved in oxidoreductase activity, cellular carbohydrate metabolism, alcohol metabolism and aflatoxin biosynthesis. The treatment affected cellular components associated with cell wall, and gene expression of glucanases, a-amylases, pectinesterase and peptidase required for its biosynthesis was increased. After decanal was removed, the culture resumed sclerotial production. Moreover, its GO terms significantly overlapped with those of the untreated culture; five of the enriched molecular functions, oxidoreductase activity, monooxygenase activity, electron carrier activity, heme binding, and iron binding were found in the untreated culture. The GO term of cellular component enriched was mainly integral protein constituents of the membrane. The results suggested that decanal halted development at the vegetative state rendering the fungus unable to produce conidia and sclerotia. The induced fluffy phenotype could be related to lower transcript abundance of flbB, flbD, and flbE but not to veA expression. Increased abundance of the laeA transcript in the treated culture correlated with early transcriptional activation of aflatoxin and kojic acid biosynthesis gene clusters. Expression profiles revealed subtle differences in timing of activation of the respective 55 secondary metabolite gene clusters.",

Monoterpene hydrocarbons (C10H16) constituted the majority (88.96%, w/w) of the total oil. The oils dose-dependently inhibited Penicillium italicum and Penicillium digitatum. The anti-fungal activity of the oils against P. italicum was attributed to citronellol, octanal, citral, decanal, nonanal, beta-pinene, linalool, and gamma-terpinene, whereas anti-fungal activity against P. digitatum is attributed to octanal, decanal, nonanal, limonene, citral, gamma-terpinene, linalool, and alpha-terpineol. The oils altered the hyphal morphology of P. italicum and P. digitatum by causing loss of cytoplasm and distortion of the mycelia. The oils significantly altered extracellular conductivity, the release of cell constituents, and the total lipid content of P. italicum and P. digitatum. The results suggest that C. reticulata Blanco essential oils generate cytotoxicity in P. italicum and P. digitatum by disrupting cell membrane integrity and causing the leakage of cell components. /Mixture; Essential oil/",

This essential oil showed a significant antibacterial activity against S. choleraesuis at the concentration of 200 ug/mL. Twenty-five volatile compounds were characterized from this essential oil by GC-MS, and aldehyde compounds were found abundant and accounted for more than three-fourths of the essential oil. Among the compounds characterized, dodecanal (C12 ) was the most abundant (55.5%), followed by decanal (C10 ) (11.6%). Both alkanals were effective against S. choleraesuis with the minimum growth inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of 100 ug/mL. The most potent antibacterial activity against this bacterium was found with two minor compounds, dodecanol (lauryl alcohol) and 2E-dodecenal, both with each MBC of 6.25 ug/mL. Their primary antibacterial action against S. choleraesuis provably comes from their ability to function as nonionic surface-active agents (surfactants), disrupting the native function of integral membrane proteins nonspecifically. Thus, the antibacterial activity is mediated by biophysical processes. In the case of 2E-alkenals, a biochemical mechanism is also somewhat involved, depending on their alkyl chain length.",

Ozonation of water in drinking water plants may produce decaldehyde. Decaldehyde is naturally found in oils from navel oranges, Valencia oranges, mid-season oranges, tangerines and white grapefruits, in extracts from apples and kiwi fruit flowers, and in volatile components of cooked meat. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.103 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates decaldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase decaldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 day. Decaldehyde does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, decaldehyde is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 70. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.80X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Decaldehyde is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. After 5 days incubation with a sewage inoculum, 22% of the theoretical BOD was reached indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, decaldehyde is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 140 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to decaldehyde may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where decaldehyde is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to decaldehyde via the ingestion of foods or drinking water, application of fragrances, and via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing decaldehyde. Decaldehyde is a volatile component of new carpeting and flooring materials. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Extra lean and regular hamburger, which had been char broiled, had a fine aerosol emission rate of 8.9 and 12.4 mg decaldehyde/kg meat, respectively(1). Decaldehyde was identified as a volatile component of raw beef(2) and roasted filberts(3). Decaldehyde was identified in concentrated aqueous orange essences(5), in fresh-squeezed orange and pineapple juice at concentrations from 0.016-0.50 ppm(6), in kiwi fruit flowers(8), and in a steam distillate of Kogyoku apple juice(10). Bisbee Delicious apples from Washington State emitted increasing concentrations of decaldehyde through the end of August (to 992.7 pL/kg-hr); concentrations decreased in apples harvested after this point (to 77.9-208.3 pL/kg-hr) but increased in apples harvested in early October (to 910.3 pL/kg-hr)(4). Decaldehyde is present, at unreported concentrations, as a volatile component of aroma of cooked beef, mutton, chicken, and pork(7). Cold-pressed oils from Florida and California citrus (oranges, tangerines, grapefruits) contained decaldehyde from 0.131-0.415 wt%(9). Decaldehyde was found in popcorn using dry extraction method at 29 ug/kg(11). Decaldehyde was identified as a volatile component in unpasteurized, fresh orange juice samples at concentrations of 0.16-0.45, 0.50, and 0.18 ppm in mechanically pressed valencia, pineapple, and ambersweet oranges, respectively(10); concentrations of 0.016, 0.022, 0.019-0.021, 0.057-0.29, 0.057, and 0.043 ppm were measured in hand pressed valencia, pineapple, hamlin, navel, pera, and ambersweet oranges, respectively(12).",

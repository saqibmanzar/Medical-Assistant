If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

As a part of the toxicological evaluation of 1,1-Dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoro-(2-(14C))-ethane, its metabolism was studied in rodents in a closed recirculating exposure system. Two male rats were individually exposed for 6 hr. Excretion of radioactivity was monitored for 48 hr after the start of the exposure. Of the radioactivity introduced into the chamber, 14% was recovered in urine within the period of observation. Excretion of metabolites in the urine was very slow. Trifluoroacetic acid was the major metabolite of 1,1-Dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoro-(2-(14C))-ethane and N-trifluoroacetyl-2-aminoethanol and N-acetyl-S-(2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethyl)-L-cysteine were identified as minor urinary metabolites of 1,1-Dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoro-(2-(14C))-ethane. Forty-eight hours after the start of the exposure, covalent binding of radioactive metabolites to protein was highest in liver followed by kidney and lung. Covalent binding above background levels was not observed in pancreas and testis, the target organs of 1,1-Dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoro-(2-(14C))-ethane tumourigenicity. These results suggest that the biotransformation of 1,1-Dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoro-(2-(14C))-ethane in rodents follows a pathway identical to those of the extensively studied structural analogue halothane.",

Many HCFCs are structural analogues of the anesthetic agent halothane and may follow a common pathway of biotransformation and formation of adducts to protein-centered and other cellular nucleophiles. Exposure of rats to a single dose of halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane) or of the candidate CFC substitute HCFC 123 (2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane) led to the formation of trifluoroacetylated protein adducts (CF3CO-proteins) not only in the liver, but also in the kidney as a novel target tissue for protein trifluoroacetylation. CF3CO-proteins in the kidney amounted to about 5% of those formed in the liver of the same animal. The amount of CF3CO-proteins formed within the kidney was roughly reflected by the capacity of metabolism of halothane or HCFC 123 by rat kidney microsomes in vitro which amounted to about 10% of that observed with liver microsomes. By immunohistochemistry, CF3CO-proteins in the kidney were mainly localized in the tubular segments of the cortex. In the liver, the density of CF3CO-proteins decreased from the central vein towards the portal triad. In vitro incubation of rat liver microsomes with halothane or HCFC 123 resulted in extensive formation of CF3CO-proteins and reproduced faithfully the pattern of liver CF3CO-proteins obtained in vivo. CF3CO-proteins generated in vitro were immunochemically not discernible from those generated in vivo. Glutathione (5 mM) and cysteine (5 mM) virtually abolished CF3CO-protein formation; the release of Br- from halothane and Cl- from HCFC 123 was reduced to much lesser a degree. S-Methyl-glutathione, N-acetyl-cysteine, methionine, and N-acetyl-methionine only slightly affected the formation of CF3CO-proteins or metabolism of either substrate. The data suggest that metabolism and concomitant CF3CO-protein formation of halothane or of candidate CFC replacements like HCFC 123 is not restricted to the liver but also takes place in the kidney. Furthermore, an in vitro system for CF3CO-protein formation has been developed and used to show that protein-centered and glutathione-centered nucleophilic sites compete for intermediates of metabolism of halothane or of HCFC 123.",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /CFCs and HCFCs/",

HCFCs were developed as transitional substitutes for Class I substances and are subject to a later phaseout schedule than Class I substances. ... Although there are currently 34 controlled HCFCs, only a few are commonly used. The most widely used have been HCFC-22 (usually a refrigerant), HCFC-141b (a solvent and foam-blowing agent), and HCFC-142b (a foam-blowing agent and component in refrigerant blends). ... As a Party to the Montreal Protocol, the U.S. must incrementally decrease HCFC consumption and production, culminating in a complete HCFC phaseout in 2030. The major milestones that are upcoming for developed countries are a reduction in 2010 to at least 75 percent below baseline HCFC levels and a reduction in 2015 to at least 90 percent below baseline.  Section 605 of the Clean Air Act sets the U.S. phaseout targets for Class II substances. In 1993, the EPA established the phaseout framework and the \"worst-first\" approach that focused first on HCFC-22, HCFC-141b, and HCFC-142b because these three HCFCs have the highest ODPs of all HCFCs. To meet the required 2004 reduction, the EPA phased out HCFC-141b in 2003 and froze the production and consumption of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b. In 2009, EPA reduced the production and import of virgin HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b and limited the use of those compounds to meet the Montreal Protocol's 2010 milestones.",

The \"2010 HCFC Allocation Rule\" allocated allowances for each year between 2010 and 2014. To meet the stepdown, the number of allowances for HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b were less than for the 2003-2009 control periods. EPA also issued allowances for HCFC-123, HCFC-124, HCFC-225ca, and HCFC-225cb. The rules also limited the use of virgin HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b to existing refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. The \"Pre-Charted Appliances Rule\" banned the sale or distribution of air-conditioning and refrigeration products containing HCFC-22, HCFC-142b, or blends containing one or both of these substances, beginning January 1, 2010. ... The \"2010 HCFC Allocation Rule\" was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Arkema v EPA. In August, 2010, the court decided against EPA. EPA interprets the Court's decision as vacating the portion of the rule that establishes company-by-company production and consumption baselines and calendar-year allowances for HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b. All other aspects of the rule are intact. On August 5, 2011, EPA issued an interim final rule that establishes new company-by-company HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b baselines and allocates production and consumption allowances for 2011.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The original Montreal Protocol was agreed on 16 September 1987 and entered into force on 1 January 1989. The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(v) and 2.125(e)(4)(iv) is effective December 31, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(iii) is effective June 30, 2011.

HUMAN EXPOSURE: Exposure to the general public to HCFC-123 is expected to be minimal. There is however, the potential for exposure during the manufacture of HCFC-123 and the manufacture and use of products containing this chemical. Limited information is available on the effects of HCFC-123 on humans. Cases of dizziness, headache and nausea have been reported following a single exposure to an unknown level of airborne HCFC-123, as well as cases of manifest or subclinical liver disease associated with repeated occupational exposures to HCFC-123 vapors at 5-1125 ppm (31.3-7030 mg/cu m) for 1-4 months. There was some evidence of clastogenic activity in human lymphocytes exposed to HCFC-123 at high cytotoxic concn in vitro. The most relevant critical effects for a single, brief exposure to this chemical are CNS depression and incr likelihood of ephinephrine induced cardiac arrythmia. Liver lesions were noted in workers exposed to HCFC-123 levels above 5 ppm(31.3 mg/cu m) for 1-4 mo. ANIMAL STUDIES: The acute toxicity of HCFC-123 in laboratory animals is low. Inhalation for a few minutes to a few hours causes liver lesions in guinea pigs at 1000 ppm (6.25 g/cu m) and central nervous system (CNS) depression in all species examined at 5000 ppm (31.3 g/cu m) and ephinephrine induced cardiac arrythmia in dogs at 20,000 ppm (125 g/cu m). In the rat and hamster, inhalation of more than 30,000 ppm (188 mg/cu m) for 4 hr causes severe CNS depression and death. HCFC-123 is not a skin irritant or sensitizer. It can cause eye irritation in liquid form. In repeated exposure inhalation toxicity studies lasting 2-39 wk in rats, guinea pigs, dogs and monkeys, the main target organs were the liver, the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal endocrine system, and the CNS. There was no evidence that HCFC-123 is teratogenic in laboratory animals or induces reproductive or fetal toxicity at levels of exposure lower than those that cause other systemic effects. Growth was retarded in neonatal rats and monkeys reared by dams exposed to HCFC-123. The main metabolite of HCFC-123, trifluoroacetic acid, was found in the milk of dams. In vitro and in vivo tests for genetic toxicity were negative. In a 2 year inhalation study in rats, there was an incr incidence of precancerous lesions and benign tumors in the liver, pancreas and testes, but no exposure related incr of malignant tumors.",

A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin & countershock may be effective. Cryogenic dermal injuries should be treated by water bath rewarming at 40-42 \u00b0C until vasodilatory flush has returned. Elevation of the limb & standard frostbite management with late surgical debridement should be utilized. Ocular exposure requires irrigation & slit lamp evaluation for injury. /Freons/",

Causality between occupational exposure to 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane and liver dysfunction was examined. Levels of exposure to 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane were estimated retrospectively by reproducing working conditions and by a job record survey. Health surveillance, including liver function and subjective symptoms, was done when two workers first complained of ill health. The mean 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane concentration in air was more than 200 ppm with a peak concentration of about 1,000 ppm in a processing area where 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane was used. 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane of 1824 ppm was detected in the adjunct areas where 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane vapor was not generated. Workers (n=14) were then classified into high (n=5) and low (n=9) exposure groups according to the estimated exposure level, which was confirmed by determination of urinary trifluoroacetic acid. Mean serum AST and ALT levels were 236 IU/I and 476 IU/I among the high-exposed workers, and exceeded 500 IU/I in three workers. Various types of symptoms involving the central nervous system and digestive organs, and irritation of the mucous membrane, were also experienced. The degree and prevalence of these health effects were higher in the high exposure group, which indicates the exposure-effect and exposure-response relationships. The consistency and temporality of the relationship between 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane exposure and the observed health effects were also confirmed. We conclude that repeated exposure to high concentrations of 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane for no more than five weeks causes acute severe liver dysfunction with various symptoms in humans. Biological plausibility must be clarified to confirm the causality.",

When HCFC-123 was introduced as a precision cleaning agent in a controlled operation, marked elevations in serum alanine transaminase and serum aspartase transaminase were noted in exposed workers. Sampling taken during start-up documented personal samples from 24-480 ppm (375 and 21 min, respectively) and area samples of 18-180 ppm (375 and 21 min, respectively). Personal and area samples collected after the liver abnormalities were identified ranged from 5-12 ppm. Exposure data were not available for the period when the abnormalities are suspected to have developed. Two models were developed to estimate exposure during the unmonitored period: (1) the entire plant as a homogenous box and (2) evaporation into smaller work zones. Modeling using the entire building estimated 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) exposures of 10-35 ppm. Modeled estimates of work area and air exchange rates indicated that degreaser exposed workers could have experienced peak levels of 280-2,100 ppm (8-hour TWAs 252-1,630 ppm). Modeling of the work environment, estimated to be one-third of the volume of the entire open building, indicated peak exposures of 28-210 ppm (8-hour TWAs 25-163 ppm). These ranges estimate the minimum and maximum exposure levels. The best estimates, using 12 air changes per day, suggest peak levels around the degreaser of 635-2,100 ppm (8-hour TWA 499-1,630 ppm) and 63-207 ppm (8-hour TWAs 50-163 ppm) in the work area. These are the first estimates of exposure level associated with these hepatotoxic effects; all are significantly higher than personal and area samples collected for HCFC-123 after the liver abnormalities were identified.",

P450 activates HCFC-123, both oxidatively and reductively, to reactive species which attack P450 itself and also damage other targets leading to hepatotoxicity. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that some haloalkanes, including halomethanes CCl4, CCl3Br, CHCl4 and CH2Cl2 as well as halothane, are activated by different hemoproteins to reactive metabolites resulting in the protein's suicidal inactivation. Among these is methemalbumin (MHA), a synthetic complex of hem with human albumin often used as a model for various natural hemoproteins, such as P450. The aim of this study was to use MHA as a model to investigate the mechanism of P450 inactivation by HCFC-123. We found that MHA can reductively activate HCFC-123 to reactive species resulting in the loss of its hem group. During anerobic incubation of MHA with 10 mM HCFC-123, a typical reduced difference spectrum was observed with a 470-nm peak that increased with time, indicating an interaction between HCFC-123 or HCFC-123 metabolites and hem. In similar anerobic incubations, a significant loss of hem was measured using both the pyridine-hemochromogen technique and an ion-pairing reverse-phase HPLC method (37 and 30%, respectively). The loss of hem was time-, but not dose-dependent. No statistically significant loss of protoporphyrin IX, as measured by a fluorescence technique, or of the absolute hem spectrum produced in presence of CO (CO-hem complex) was observed up to 10 mM HCFC-123. Finally, a small but statistically significant inorganic fluoride production was measured in the presence of 20 mM HCFC-123 using an F(-)-specific electrode. Taken together, these results indicate that incubation of the non-enzymatic P450 model MHA with HCFC-123 under anerobic conditions leads to reductive activation of the substrate, resulting in the modification of hem, as was previously shown to occur for halothane. The hem modification is due to interaction of the prosthetic hem group of MHA with HCFC-123 metabolites. These data confirm the results of previous work with rat liver microsomal P450 and confirm suicidal destruction of hem to be the mechanism responsible for the HCFC-123-dependent loss of the enzyme's content and catalytic function.",

Both are oxidatively metabolized by CYP2EI, producing a reactive trifluoroacyl acid chloride intermediate and have been shown to cause acute liver necrosis in the guinea pig. With halothane, liver injury has been associated with the degree of reactive intermediate binding to hepatic protein. This injury can be potentiated by prior glutathione (GSH) depletion. Thus, the combination of GSH depletion and 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane exposure was evaluated for its hepatotoxic potential in this species. Mate outbred Hartley guinea pigs were injected with either 0.8 g/kg l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) to deplete hepatic glutathione or vehicle control solution 24 hr before a 4-hr inhalation exposure to 1.0% (v/v) 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane with 40% 02. 1,1-Dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane caused minimal liver injury with only 1 of 8 exposed animals displaying confluent zone 3 necrosis. GSH depletion potentiated injury producing submassive to massive liver necrosis in some animals. This potentiation was associated with a 36% increase in covalent binding of reactive 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane intermediates to hepatic protein. These results were not due to alterations in the biotransformation of 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane as indicated by plasma concentrations of the metabolites trifluoroacetic acid and fluoride ion which were not affected by BSO pretreatment. 1,1-Dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane was also found to cause a decrease in liver GSH concentrations following exposure. These findings demonstrate a role for hepatic GSH in helping to prevent covalent binding by the trifluoroacyl acid chloride intermediate. Inhalation of 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane can cause acute hepatic injury in the guinea pig that is worsened by low hepatic GSH concentrations.",

Much information is available on chronic toxicity of 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane in animals, while the information available for halothane is from short-term animal exposures or chronic, low level human exposures. Thus, there is little biochemical information available on similar endpoints for these two chemicals, which share common metabolites. In the present study, male rats were exposed to 5000 ppm 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane, 5000 ppm halothane, or room air for 6 hr per day for 5 consecutive days. Rats exposed to both test compounds gained little or no weight during the study. Liver weights were slightly decreased in the rats exposed to 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane and halothane compared to controls. The serum triglycerides were decreased to approximately 20% of control level in rats exposed to both 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane and halothane, and serum cholesterol was decreased to less than 80% of control by both compounds. Both test compounds increased hepatic beta-oxidation by approximately 3-fold over control, and 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane caused a significant increase in hepatic cytochrome p450 content, while the increase in cytochrome p450 was not statistically significant in the halothane-treated rats. The results indicate that 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane and halothane share not only common metabolic pathways, but also several common biological effects, specifically those associated with peroxisome proliferation. These data indicate that human experience with halothane may be useful in the risk assessment of 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2,2-dichloroethane.",

Limited (and declining) use in oral pressurized metered-dose inhalers will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 718 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is about 2.2 years. 2,2-Dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight in the troposphere. 2,2-Dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane is fairly soluble in water and may be removed from the air by rain. If released to soil, 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 140. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.0256 atm-cu m/mole. 2,2-Dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Primary and ultimate degradation of 24% and 10%, respectively, using the Closed Bottle test suggest that biodegradation is not a fast environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.7 hours and 4.9 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 13 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives at pH 7 and 8 of 134 and 13 years, respectively. Occupational exposure to 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3.

Their use as rodenticides is based on the inhibition of the vitamin K-dependent step in the synthesis of a number of blood coagulation factors. The vitamin K-dependent proteins ...in the coagulation cascade... are the procoagulant factors II (prothrombin), VII (proconvertin), IX (Christmas factor) and X (Stuart-Prower factor), and the coagulation-inhibiting proteins C and S. All these proteins are synthesized in the liver. Before they are released into the circulation the various precursor proteins undergo substantial (intracellular) post-translational modification. Vitamin K functions as a co-enzyme in one of these modifications, namely the carboxylation at well-defined positions of 10-12 glutamate residues into gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The presence of these Gla residues is essential for the procoagulant activity of the various coagulations factors. Vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) is the active co-enzyme, and its oxidation to vitamin K 2,3-epoxide (KO) provides the energy required for the carboxylation reaction. The epoxide is than recycled in two reduction steps mediated by the enzyme KO reductase... . The latter enzyme is the target enzyme for coumarin anticoagulants. Their blocking of the KO reductase leads to a rapid exhaustion of the supply of KH2, and thus to an effective prevention of the formation of Gla residues. This leads to an accumulation of non-carboxylated coagulation factor precursors in the liver. In some cases these precursors are processed further without being carboxylated, and (depending on the species) may appear in the circulation. At that stage the under-carboxylated proteins are designated as descarboxy coagulation factors. Normal coagulation factors circulate in the form of zymogens, which can only participate in the coagulation cascade after being activated by limited proteolytic degradation. Descarboxy coagulation factors have no procoagulant activity (i.e. they cannot be activated) and neither they can be converted into the active zymogens by vitamin K action. Whereas in anticoagulated humans high levels of circulating descarboxy coagulation factors are detectable, these levels are negligible in warfarin-treated rats and mice. /Anticoagulant rodenticides/",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. 2-Pivalyl-1,3-indandione is found on List B.

For suicidal ingestions with large amounts taken, if there is uncertainty about the amount of bait ingested or the general health of the patient, phytonadione (vitamin K1) given orally protects against the anticoagulant effect of these rodenticides, with essentially no risk to the patient. In accidental ingestions with healthy children involving only a taste or single swallow, no medical treatment is required, but children should be observed for bleeding and bruising. If a larger amount may have been ingested, prothrombin time (PT) should be monitored at 24 and 48 hours, with phytonadione therapy initiated for elevated PT or clinical signs of bleeding. CAUTION: Phytonadione, specificaly, is required. Neither vitamin K3 (menadione, Hykinone) nor vitamin K4 (menadiol) is an antidote for these anticoagulants. /Coumarins and Indandiones/",

For this reason, the intravenous route should be used only in cases of severe poisoning. Flushing, dizziness, hypotension, dyspnea, and cyanosis have characterized adverse reactions. Antidotal therapy in cases of severe bleeding should be supplemented with transfusion of fresh blood or plasma. Use of fresh blood or plasma represents the most rapidly effective method of stopping hemorrhage due to these anticoagulants, but the effect may not endure. Therefore, the transfusions should be given along with phytonadione therapy. Determine prothrombin time (PT) and hemoglobin concentrations every 6-12 hours to assess effectiveness of antihemorrhagic measures. When normal blood coagulation is restored, it may be advisable to drain large hemotomata. Ferrous sulfate therapy may be appropriate in the recuperative period to rebuild lost erythrocyte mass. /Coumarins and Indandiones/",

Daily dose levels of pindone were 0.25 mg kg-1 for eagles, 4.0 mg kg-1 for magpies and 5.0 mg kg-1 for pigeons, parrots and ducks. Considerable species variation in response was observed, and within each species there was considerable individual variation in response to pindone. The PTs of magpies and ducks increased to approximately twice baseline levels. Significant elevations (4- to 7-fold) occurred in parrots, pigeons and eagles. Clinical symptoms were observed in only one species, the wedge-tailed eagle. Results of our dosing trials indicate that all species tested are theoretically at risk of pindone poisoning, although the risk to some species is minimized by factors such as population size, food availability and bait placement.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.4X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pindone will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase pindone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6 days. Particulate-phase pindone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, pindone is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 900. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.3X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, pindone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 120 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since pindone is no longer produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Hence, we investigated the response of P. polymyxa to high 2,3-BD concentrations. In fed-batch cultures (6-L bioreactor) 2,3-BD was accumulated to a maximum concentration of 47 g/L despite the presence of residual 13 g/L glucose in the medium. Concomitantly, accumulation of acetoin, the precursor of 2,3-BD increased after maximum 2,3-BD concentration was reached, suggesting that 2,3-BD was reconverted to acetoin after the concentration tolerance threshold of 2,3-BD was exceeded. Cultures of P. polymyxa were then challenged with levo-2,3-BD (20, 40 and 60 g/L) at 0h in a glucose medium, and a concentration dependent growth inhibition response to levo-2,3-BD was observed. The growth of P. polymyxa was completely inhibited by 60 g/L levo-2,3-BD. Furthermore, P. polymyxa was challenged with incremental 2,3-BD concentrations (20, 40 and 60 g/L at 12, 24 and 36 hr, respectively) to mimic 2,3-BD accumulation during fermentation. Interestingly, 2,3-BD was reconverted to acetoin when its concentration reached 60 g/L, possibly to alleviate 2,3-BD toxicity. Collectively, our findings indicate that 2,3-BD-mediated toxicity is a major metabolic impediment to 2,3-BD overproduction, thus, making it an important metabolic engineering target towards rational design of a 2,3-BD-overproducing strain.",

Diacetyl and acetoin were reduced to 2,3-butanediol in these experiments, but acetoin and 2,3-butanediol were scarcely oxidized to diacetyl, indicating that the reduction reaction to 2,3-butanediol from diacetyl occurs actively in rat liver. The formation of acetoin from diacetyl required either NADH or NADPH as a reductant, while the reduction of acetoin to 2,3-butanediol required NADH. Acetoin and 2,3-butanediol were more readily accumulated than diacetyl in brain tissue.",

By chlorohydrination of this fraction with a solution of chlorine in water and subsequent cyclization of the chlorohydrins with sodium hydroxide, a butene oxide mixture of the following composition is obtained: 55% trans-2,3-butene oxide, 30% cis-2,3-butene oxide, and 15% 1,2-butene oxide. Hydrolysis of this mixture (50 bar, 160-220 \u00b0C, reaction enthalpy deltaH= -42 kJ/mol) yields a mixture of butanediols which is separated by vacuum fractionation. In order to avoid the formation of polyethers during the hydrolysis, an excess of water must be used. ... By this reaction sequence, meso-2,3-butanediol is obtained from trans-2-butene via trans-2,3-butene oxide; the racemic mixture of R,R- and S,S-2,3-butanediol is formed analogously from cis-2-butene via cis-2,3-butene oxide.",

Usual validation parameters were tested: linearity, repeatability and intermediate precision, limits of detection and quantification, carry over and ion suppression. Limits of detection were between 0.18 and 1.1 mg/L, and limits of quantification were between 0.4 and 2.3 mg/L. Separation of isomers was possible either chromatographically or by selecting specific multiple reaction monitoring transitions. This method could be a useful tool in case of suspected intoxication with antifreeze agents, solvents, dietary supplements or some medical drug compounds.",

Derivatives of 2,3-butanediol are important as intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry. 2,3-Butanediols have some interest as humectants and in the synthesis of polymers and plasticizers. HUMAN STUDIES: For erythrocytes a solution of 30% 2,3-butanediol showed relatively low toxicity. Hemolysis was only 2% after 5 hr, but increased to 6% after 21 hr and reached 60% after 46 hr. ANIMAL STUDIES:  Effects of 2,3-butanediol on the central nervous system (CNS) were investigated by using the analysis of EEG (electroencephalogram) spectral powers recorded at the frontal cortex in rats. It was found that 2,3-butanediol treatment led to increase in EEG spectral powers by oral and intravenous administrations at relatively low doses. From these findings it can be concluded that 2,3-butanediol has a potent CNS depressant effect. 2,3-Butanediol was not embryotoxic when examined in cultured 10-day rat embryo. 2,3-Butanediol has a negative regulatory effect on rats innate immunity response.",

The 2,3-butanediol contained 96.7% (w/w) racemic mixture of the levo and dextro isomers and only 3.1% (w/w) of the meso isomer (2,3-butanediol 97% dl). The concentrations of 2,3-butanediol were 30 and 35% (w/w). A solution of 30% 2,3-butanediol showed relatively low toxicity. Hemolysis was only 2% after 5 hr, but increased to 6% after 21 hr and reached 60% after 46 hr. Adding 4% (w/w) of one of the above compounds drastically decreased the toxicity. The two most efficient were the sugars trehalose and sucrose. With 30% 2,3-butanediol and 4% of any of the four compounds, hemolysis was about 0.6% after 2 days of storage. Furthermore, with trehalose or sucrose, hemolysis remained below 3% for 1 month. With sorbitol or mannitol, hemolysis slowly increased to 2% after 7 days and then increased rapidly. Even with 35% 2,3-butanediol, solutions containing trehalose or sucrose showed low toxicity. Hemolysis was also measured after redilution to buffered solution without 2,3-butanediol and without the additive, to mimic perfusion of organs with cryoprotectants and washing. Minima of hemolysis were observed after a few days of storage. The present solutions also have high glass-forming tendencies. They could be of great interest for organ vitrification.",

The 2,3-butanediol contained 96.7% (w/w) racemic mixture of the levo and dextro isomers and only 3.1% (w/w) of the meso isomer (2,3-butanediol 97% dl). The concentrations of 2,3-butanediol were 30 and 35% (w/w). A solution of 30% 2,3-butanediol showed relatively low toxicity. Hemolysis was only 2% after 5 hr, but increased to 6% after 21 hr and reached 60% after 46 hr. Adding 4% (w/w) of one of the above compounds drastically decreased the toxicity. The two most efficient were the sugars trehalose and sucrose. With 30% 2,3-butanediol and 4% of any of the four compounds, hemolysis was about 0.6% after 2 days of storage. Furthermore, with trehalose or sucrose, hemolysis remained below 3% for 1 month. With sorbitol or mannitol, hemolysis slowly increased to 2% after 7 days and then increased rapidly. Even with 35% 2,3-butanediol, solutions containing trehalose or sucrose showed low toxicity. Hemolysis was also measured after redilution to buffered solution without 2,3-butanediol and without the additive, to mimic perfusion of organs with cryoprotectants and washing. Minima of hemolysis were observed after a few days of storage. The present solutions also have high glass-forming tendencies. They could be of great interest for organ vitrification.",

High doses of ethanol were required for exhibiting an increase of EEG spectral powers in the delta (0-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) waves when it was given either orally or intravenously. On the other hand, when ethanol was injected intracerebroventricularly, the drug caused a potent increasing effect of EEG spectral powers. Both acetoin and 2,3-butanediol were found to increase in EEG spectral powers by oral and intravenous administrations at relatively low doses. In addition, acetoin and 2,3-butanediol were more effective than ethanol in increasing EEG spectral powers in the delta and theta bands after intracerebroventricular administration. From these findings it can be concluded that both acetoin and 2,3-butanediol have a potent CNS depressant effect.",

This study examines whether 2,3-butanediol and 1,2-propanediol have the capacity to impair insulin action acutely in vivo in the rat. Using the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, it is shown that the two diols reduce whole-body glucose utilization (by approximately 30%), with the onset of insulin resistance in vivo occurring at plasma concentrations of 2,3-butanediol (33 umol/L) at least one order of magnitude (P<0.001) lower than 1,2-propanediol (432 umol/L). Tracer methodologies using [U-(14)C]glucose and 2-deoxy[1-(3)H]glucose indicate that the reduction in whole-body glucose utilization is accompanied by a reduction in glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in the skeletal muscle and heart.",

At acetaldehyde concentrations of 100 and 260 uM, no significant effects were observed on embryonic protein, DNA, somite development, gross morphology, or viability. 800 uM was overtly toxic causing rapid death and necrosis. 2,3-butanediol at a culture medium concentration of 25 mM had no effect on any of the above parameters. The significance of these results in relation to other animal experiments with these compounds and possible ramifications regarding the etiology of the human Fetal Alcohol Syndrome are discussed.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.24 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,3-butanediol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,3-butanediol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours. 2,3-Butanediol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,3-butanediol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.9X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. 2,3-Butanediol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using anaerobic test conditions, 75-100% biodegradation was reported, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important enviornmental fate process in soil and water under anoxic conditions. If released into water, 2,3-butanediol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2,3-butanediol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,3-butanediol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,3-butanediol mostly through ingestion of food products containing 2,3-butanediol. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.9X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.18 mm Hg(4), and assigned value for water solubility of 1X10+6 mg/L (miscible)(5). 2,3-Butanediol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of -0.92(7) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Using anaerobic test conditions, 75-100% biodegradation was reported(8), suggesting that biodegradation may be an important enviornmental fate process in soil and water under anoxic conditions.",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

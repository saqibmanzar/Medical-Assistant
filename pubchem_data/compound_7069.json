When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It is used in polymers and adhesive systems, as a high strength backbone or cross linking intermediate. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Isocyanates are irritating to the skin and the mucous membranes, Skin conditions range from localized itching to wide spread eczema. Eye affections are less common and lacrimation is often found, conjunctivitis is rare. Respiratory system effects can be severe. ANIMAL STUDIES: Limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. Groups of male and female B6C3F1 mice, six weeks old were given dietary concentrations of this chemical for 78 weeks followed by a basal diet for a further 25 weeks. There was no significant difference in treated and control animals. There was no increased incidence of tumors in treated animals. Groups of male and female Fischer 344/N rats, six weeks of age received the chemical by gavage for 22 weeks. Animals were subsequently fed a basal diet for 22 weeks. A significant increase in combined incidence of leukemias and malignant lymphomas was observed. Increased incidence of various skin tumors was also noted on the head, back and inguinal areas in males and females. Increased incidences of Zymbal gland tumors was observed. Levels of Evidence of  Carcinogenicity: Male Rats: Positive; Female Rats: Positive; Male Mice: Negative; Female Mice: Negative."

It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

Animals were subsequently fed diets containing concentrations of 22 000 or 44 000 mg/kg 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine-4,4'-diisocyanate for a further 56 weeks and were then kept on basal diet and observed for a further 26 weeks prior to sacrifice. Control groups of 20 male and 20 female rats received the suspending vehicle alone for 22 weeks followed by 82 weeks of basal diet. Survival of both male and female rats at termination of the study (104 weeks) was dose related: 15/20 (75%) control, 22/50 (44%) low dose and 16/50 (32%) high dose males; 15/20 (75%) control, 21/50 (42%) low dose and 21/50 (42%) high dose females. A significant increase in the combined incidence of leukemias and malignant lymphomas was observed: 0/18 control, 18/48 low dose and 16/46 high dose males (p= 0.022, trend test; p= 0.001 (low dose) and p= 0.002 (high dose), Fisher exact test); 1/20 control, 8/50 low dose and 15/48 high dose females (p= 0.007, trend test; p= 0.016 (high dose) Fisher exact test). Increased incidences of various types of skin tumors were observed on the head, back and inguinal areas in males and females. This increase was statistically significant in both high dose (14/46; p= 0.005, Fisher exact test) and low dose (17/48; p= 0.002, Fisher exact test) males as compared to controls (0/18). A treatment related increase in the incidence of Zymbal gland tumors was observed: 1/18 control, 6/48 low dose and 9/46 high dose males; 0/20 control, 9/50 low dose and 6/48 high dose females. The historical incidence of these neoplasms in untreated Fischer 344/N rats from the same laboratory was 1/300 males and 0/298 females. A dose related incidence of endometrial stromal polyps was observed in females: 0/20 control, 5/48 low dose and 10/48 high dose animals (p= 0.013, trend test; p= 0.022 (high dose), Fisher exact test).

The compound was administered in the feed with the exception of the first 22 weeks of the rat bioassay, when it was administered by gavage. Twenty animals of each sex and species were placed on test as controls. During intubation the high and low dosages were 3,000 and 1,500 mg/kg, respectively, while the high and low concentrations administered in the feed to both rats and mice were 44,000 and 22,000 ppm, respectively. The compound was administered for a period of 78 weeks, followed by an observation period of 26 weeks for rats and 25 weeks for mice. There was a significant positive association between the administration of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine-4,4'-diisocyanate and mortality in male and female rats, but not in male or female mice. ... Under the conditions of this bioassay, administration of 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine-4,4'-diisocyanate was carcinogenic to Fischer 344 rats, causing neoplasms of the skin (excluding skin of the ear) in males, endometrial stromal polyps in females, and leukemia and malignant lymphoma in both sexes. The compound was also associated with the development of a combination of squamous cell carcinomas and sebaceous adenocarcinomas of the Zymbal's gland and skin of the ear in rats of both sexes. There was no evidence of the carcinogenicity of the compound in B6C3F1 mice. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: Male Rats: Positive; Female Rats: Positive; Male Mice: Negative; Female Mice: Negative.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. 2-(3-Chlorophenoxy) propionic acid is found on List B. Case No: 2110; Pesticide type: Herbicide Case Status: The last registered pesticide products containing this pesticide were voluntarily cancelled September 1996 by their registrants while the EPA was developing the RED; Active ingredient (AI): 2-(m-Chlorophenoxy)propionic acid; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered products. Thus, we characterize it as \"cancelled.\".",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.3X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours. 2-(3-Chlorophenoxy)propionic acid contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 88. The estimated pKa of 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid is 3.62, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. 2-(3-Chlorophenoxy)propionic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 2-(3-Chlorophenoxy)propionic acid was completely degraded in 25 days following a 16-day lag period using activated sludge, indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. An estimated pKa of 3.62 indicates 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected be an important environmental fate process since this compound does not contain functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid is no longer produced or used in the US and was voluntarily cancelled as of Sept, 2006. In the past, 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid was formulated as a soluble concentrate and exposure to this compound was primarily dermal and in the field where it was applied. (SRC)",

The estimated pKa of 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid is 3.62(4), indicating that this compound will exit almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. 2-(3-Chlorophenoxy)propionic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 2.3X10-4 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(6). 2-(3-Chlorophenoxy)propionic acid was completely degraded in 25 days following a 16-day lag period using activated sludge(7), indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

An estimated pKa of 3.62(4) indicates 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 11(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 2-(3-Chlorophenoxy)propionic acid was completely degraded in 25 days following a 16-day lag period using activated sludge(7), indicating that",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

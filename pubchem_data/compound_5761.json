It is well known for its psychological effects which can include altered thinking processes, closed and open eye visuals, synaesthesia, a sense of time distortion, ego death and spiritual experiences, as well as for its key role in 1960s counterculture. It is used mainly by psychonauts as an entheogen, recreational drug and as an agent in psychedelic therapy. (L1925). Debate continues over the nature and causes of chronic flashbacks.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Psychedelic psychotherapy typically involves a patient lying with their eyes-closed during peak drug effects, while listening to music and being supervised by trained psychotherapists. In this context, music is considered to be a key element in the therapeutic model; working in synergy with the drug to evoke therapeutically meaningful thoughts, emotions and imagery. The underlying mechanisms involved in this process have, however, never been formally investigated. Here we studied the interaction between LSD and music-listening on eyes-closed imagery by means of a placebo-controlled, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Twelve healthy volunteers received intravenously administered LSD (75 ug) and, on a separate occasion, placebo, before being scanned under eyes-closed resting conditions with and without music-listening. The parahippocampal cortex (PHC) has previously been linked with (1) music-evoked emotion, (2) the action of psychedelics, and (3) mental imagery. Imaging analyses therefore focused on changes in the connectivity profile of this particular structure. Results revealed increased PHC-visual cortex (VC) functional connectivity and PHC to VC information flow in the interaction between music and LSD. This latter result correlated positively with ratings of enhanced eyes-closed visual imagery, including imagery of an autobiographical nature. These findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which LSD works in combination with music listening to enhance certain subjective experiences that may be useful in a therapeutic context.",

Participants of this study were included in a prospective follow-up. 12 months after finishing LSD psychotherapy, 10 participants were tested for anxiety (STAI) and participated in a semi-structured interview. A Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) was carried out on the interviews to elaborate about LSD effects and lasting psychological changes. None of the participants reported lasting adverse reactions. The significant benefits as measured with the STAI were sustained over a 12-month period. In the QCA participants consistently reported insightful, cathartic and interpersonal experiences, accompanied by a reduction in anxiety (77.8%) and a rise in quality of life (66.7%). Evaluations of subjective experiences suggest facilitated access to emotions, confrontation of previously unknown anxieties, worries, resources and intense emotional peak experiences a la Maslow as major psychological working mechanisms. The experiences created led to a restructuring of the person's emotional trust, situational understanding, habits and world view. LSD administered in a medically supervised psychotherapeutic setting can be safe and generate lasting benefits in patients with a life-threatening disease. Explanatory models for the therapeutic effects of LSD warrant further study.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that O-H-LSD is present in human urine at concentrations 16-43 times greater than LSD, the parent compound. Additionally, these studies have determined that O-H-LSD is not generated during the specimen extraction and analytical processes or due to parent compound degradation in aqueous urine samples. However, these studies have not been conclusive in demonstrating that O-H-LSD is uniquely produced during in vivo metabolism. Phase I drug metabolism was investigated by incubating human liver microsomes and cryopreserved human hepatocytes with LSD. The reaction was quenched at various time points, and the aliquots were extracted using liquid partitioning and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. O-H-LSD was positively identified in all human liver microsomal and human hepatocyte fractions incubated with LSD. In addition, O-H-LSD was not detected in any microsomal or hepatocyte fraction not treated with LSD nor in LSD specimens devoid of microsomes or hepatocytes. This study provides definitive evidence that O-H-LSD is produced as a metabolic product following incubation of human liver microsomes and hepatocytes with LSD.",

The metabolites identified were 13- and 14-hydroxy-LSD and their glucuronic acid conjugates, 2-oxo-LSD, de-ethyl LSD and a naphthostyril derivative. There occur, however, important species differences in the nature and amounts of the various metabolites. In the rat and guinea pig the major metabolites were the glucuronic acid conjugates of 13- and 14-hydroxy-LSD which were found in both urine and bile. The guinea pig excreted significant amounts of 2-oxo-LSD in urine and bile. De-ethyl LSD was a minor urinary metabolite in both species. The metabolism of LSD appeared to be more complicated in the rhesus monkey. The urine contained at least nine metabolites of which four were identified as follows: 13- and 14-hydroxy-LSD (as glucuronic acid conjugates) de-ethyl LSD and a naphthostyril derivative. Unlike the rat and guinea pig the glucuronic acid conjugates of 13- and 14-hydroxy-LSD were only present in small amounts. Of the remaining five unidentified metabolites, three were major. The biliary metabolites of (14)C-iso-LSD in the rat have been studied and been shown to be similar to those produced from (14)C-LSD, namely 13- and 14-hydroxy-iso-LSD and their glucuronic acid conjugates and 2-oxo-iso-LSD.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

LSD (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) produced locomotor hyperactivity, disruption of /prepulse inhibition (PPI)/ and a number of behaviors indicative of 5-HT activation such as wet-dog shakes, back muscle contractions and forepaw treading. These various behavioral effects of LSD were studied in both Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats, although with the exception of back muscle contractions which were more prominent in Sprague-Dawley rats, no major strain differences were detected. The PPI disruption induced by LSD (0.1 mg/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats was completely reversed by pretreatment with the selective 5-HT(2A) antagonist MDL 100907 (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, s.c.). In contrast, pretreatment with antagonists at 5-HT(2C), (SB 242084 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.)); 5-HT(2B/2C) (SDZ SER 082 (1 mg/kg, s.c.)); 5-HT(1A), ((+)-WAY 100135 (1 and 20 mg/kg, s.c.)) and 5-HT(6) receptors, (RO 04-6790 (30 mg/kg, i.p.)), all failed to influence LSD-induced disruption of PPI. The dopamine DA(2like) receptor antagonist, haloperidol (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg, s.c.), was without effect against an LSD-induced disruption of PPI. Finally, selective blockade of 5-HT(2A) but not 5-HT(2C) receptors completely abolished the locomotor hyperactivity induced by LSD. These findings provide empirical evidence to support the view that the hallucinogenic effects of LSD are mediated by a direct agonist effect at 5-HT(2A) receptors.",

By genetically expressing /5-HT(2A) receptor (2AR)/ only in cortex, /investigators/show that 2AR-regulated pathways on cortical neurons are sufficient to mediate the signaling pattern and behavioral response to hallucinogens. Hallucinogenic and nonhallucinogenic 2AR agonists both regulate signaling in the same 2AR-expressing cortical neurons. However, the signaling and behavioral responses to the hallucinogens are distinct. While lisuride and LSD both act at 2AR expressed by cortex neurons to regulate phospholipase C, LSD responses also involve pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G(i/o) proteins and Src. ...",

Although LSD interacts with other receptors, the activation of 5-HT(2A) receptors is thought to mediate the hallucinogenic properties of LSD. The goal of this study was to identify the brain sites activated by LSD and to determine the influence of 5-HT(2A) receptors in this activation. Rats were pretreated with the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist MDL 100907 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle 30 min prior to LSD (500 mg/kg, i.p.) administration and killed 3 hr later. Brain tissue was examined for Fos protein expression by immunohistochemistry. LSD administration produced a five- to eight-fold increase in Fos-like immunoreactivity in medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and central nucleus of amygdala. However, in dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens no increase in Fos-like immunoreactivity was observed. Pretreatment with MDL 100907 completely blocked LSD-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity in medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, but only partially blocked LSD-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity in amygdala. Double-labeled immunohistochemistry revealed that LSD did not induce Fos-like immunoreactivity in cortical cells expressing 5-HT(2A) receptors, suggesting an indirect activation of cortical neurons. These results indicate that the LSD activation of medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex is mediated by 5-HT(2A) receptors, whereas in amygdala 5-HT(2A) receptor activation is a component of the response. These findings support the hypothesis that the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and perhaps the amygdala, are important regions involved in the production of hallucinations.",

The indoleamine hallucinogen D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD, which binds to 5-HT1A, 1B, 1D, 1E, 1F, 2A, 2C, 5, 6, 7, dopamine D1 and D2, and alpha1 and alpha2 adrenergic receptors), but not their non-hallucinogenic congeners, inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced inward current and NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic responses evoked by electrical stimulation of the forceps minor in pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortical slices. The inhibitory effect of hallucinogens was mimicked by 5-HT in the presence of selective 5-HT1A and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The inhibitory action of ... LSD ... on the NMDA transmission was blocked by the 5-HT2A receptor antagonists R-(+)-alpha-(2, 3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[4-fluorophenylethyl]-4-piperidinethanol and ketanserin. However, at low concentrations ...LSD... only partially depressed the NMDA response, /and/ blocked the inhibitory effect of 5-HT, suggesting a partial agonist action. Whereas N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7, a calmodulin antagonist) and N-[2-[[[3-(4'-chlorophenyl)- 2-propenyl]methylamino]methyl]phenyl]-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4'-methoxy-benzenesulfonamide phosphate (KN-93, a Ca2+/CaM-KII inhibitor), but not the negative control 2-[N-4'methoxybenzenesulfonyl]amino-N-(4'-chlorophenyl)-2-propenyl-N -methylbenzylamine phosphate (KN-92), blocked the inhibitory action of LSD ..., the selective protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine was without any effect. /The authors/ conclude that phenethylamine and indoleamine hallucinogens may exert their hallucinogenic effect by interacting with 5-HT2A receptors via a Ca2+/CaM-KII-dependent signal transduction pathway as partial agonists and modulating the NMDA receptors-mediated sensory, perceptual, affective and cognitive processes.",

Generally, the induction of vomiting is NOT recommended outside of a physician's care due to the risk of aspirating the chemical into the victim's lungs. However, if the victim is conscious and not convulsing and if medical help is not readily available, consider the risk of inducing vomiting because of the high toxicity of the chemical ingested. Ipecac syrup or salt water may be used in such an emergency. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

In this review phencyclidine and related arylcyclohexylamines and hallucinogens, using LSD as the prototype, are considered as two distinct classes of abused drugs. Within these classes drugs that are found on the street are discussed, and a current epidemiological summary is provided. The abuse liability and dependence potential of these drugs are evaluated by considering four major determinants of their abuse. First, is the ability of a drug to function as a positive reinforcer and increase the probability of operant behavior leading to its delivery. Animal data describing the reinforcing effects of PCP are reviewed with respect to the influence of variables controlling drug-reinforced behavior; however, there are no animal models of hallucinogen-reinforced behavior. Several methods of quantifying reinforcing efficacy are discussed. A second determinant is the subjective effects of the respective drugs. These effects are described and compared across drugs based on clinical reports in humans and drug discrimination studies in animals. A third determinant is the behavioral and physiological toxicity that results from acute and chronic use of these drugs. Clinical reports and results of sensitive tests that have been developed for laboratory animals are reviewed. A fourth determinant is the dependence potential that exists with these drugs, measured by tolerance development and the extent to which behavioral and physiological disturbances occur when drug use is terminated.",

It is used in biochemical research as antagonist to serotonin. LSD has been used experimentally as adjunct in study and treatment of mental disorders. HUMAN STUDIES: LSD has significant cardiovascular effects owing to its sympathomimetic actions. Tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmias, shock, and respiratory arrest occur with severe overdose. Synesthesias and \"trails\" are characteristic of LSD. Synesthesias are a translation of one sensory modality into another, such as seeing colored vibrations of music, or smelling purple. Trails are formed positive afterimages that remain immediately behind an object as it moves across the subject's visual field. Adverse reactions to LSD are common. Acutely, LSD can produce a \"bad trip.\" Frightening thoughts overwhelm the user, with a loss of insight that this is a drug experience; the resulting acute panic reaction generally necessitates a visit to the emergency department.  Acute mania, schizophrenia, depression, and permanent psychoses have resulted from LSD abuse, particularly in someone of borderline stability. Tolerance occurs, but there is no withdrawal state. Sympathomimetic effects include mydriasis, flushing, tremor, hyperreflexia, hyperthermia, tachycardia, increased blood pressure, piloerection, diaphoresis, and ataxia. Nausea and vomiting may occur, and severe toxicity can result in coma, seizures, and respiratory arrest. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome may occur after LSD use. Muscle biopsy may show myoedema, focal necrosis, and glycogen and lipid depletion. Four chronic reactions were reported: (a) prolonged psychotic reactions, (b) depression and suicidal ideation, (c) flashbacks, and (d)  exacerbation of preexisting psychiatric illness. Since then, another diagnostic category has been described: hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). One hundred forty women and their consorts, admitting to the use of LSD prior to or during pregnancy were observed through 148 pregnancies. There were 83 live newborns; 8 had major congenital defects. There were 65 abortions; 53 therapeutic and 12 spontaneous. Four of 14 embryos from therapeutic abortions showed gross anomalies. Forty-three percent of first-trimester pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions. Four of eight serial pregnancies resulted in defective embryos or infants. Eight of 12 women have been unable to conceive again over an 18-month period. Significant changes in human somatic cells and in chromosomes occurred only at high doses of LSD. ANIMAL STUDIES: LSD, when administered chronically to developing animals, can inhibit body growth probably by altering the secretion of growth hormone through modifications of its neuroendocrine control. Central nervous system abnormalities were reported in day 11 mouse embryos after injecting 0.05 to 1.0 ug of LSD on day 7. In rats, fetal loss was produced by administering LSD by mouth or sc (20 ug and 5 ug respectively) between the 1st and 4th day of gestation. No specific congenital defects were reported. Using LSD 0.08 to 410 ug/kg in the hamster on the 8th day, found a small increase in defects of the central nervous system in 12 day embryos.",

It also acts as a partial agonist on the postsynaptic 5-HT1A site and has high affinity for the other 5-HT1 subtypes 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT1E. LSD's hallucinogenic effects are caused by its ability to act as a partial agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor, especially on neocortical pyramidal cells. Activation of 5-HT2A also leads to increased cortical glutamate levels. Effects of LSD on 5-HT2C, 5-HT5A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors have also been described, but their significance remains uncertain. In addition, LSD shows agonistic and antagonistic behavior at the central dopamine D1 and D2-receptors. (L1925, A2918)",

Other physical reactions to LSD are highly variable and nonspecific, and some of these reactions may be secondary to the psychological effects of LSD. The following symptoms have been reported: numbness, weakness, nausea, hypothermia or hyperthermia, elevated blood sugar, goose bumps, increase in heart rate, jaw clenching, perspiration, saliva production, mucus production, sleeplessness, hyperreflexia, and tremors. LSD also causes expansion and an altered experience of senses, emotions, memories, time, and awareness. These psychological effects (colloquially called a \"trip\") vary greatly from person to person. Visual effects may include morphing objects, illusion of movement of static surfaces, after image-like trails of moving objects, the appearance of moving colored geometric patterns, an intensification of colors and brightness, new textures on objects, blurred vision, and shape suggestibility. The auditory effects of LSD may include echo-like distortions of sounds, changes in ability to discern concurrent auditory stimuli, and a general intensification of the experience of music. Higher doses often cause intense and fundamental distortions of sensory perception such as synaesthesia, the experience of additional spatial or temporal dimensions, and temporary dissociation.

This study aims to determine if parenteral injections of the hallucinogens LSD, d,l-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine, and 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine /to rabbits/ elicit the 5-HT(2A)-mediated behavior of head bobs and whether intrahippocampal injections of LSD would produce head bobs and enhance trace eyeblink conditioning. LSD was infused into the dorsal hippocampus just prior to each of eight conditioning sessions. One day after the last infusion of LSD,(+/-)-1(2, 5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI)  was infused into the hippocampus to determine whether there had been a desensitization of the 5-HT(2A) receptor as measured by a decrease in DOI-elicited head bobs. Acute parenteral or intrahippocampal LSD elicited a 5-HT(2A) but not a 5-HT(2C)-mediated behavior, and chronic administration enhanced conditioned responding relative to vehicle controls. Rabbits that had been chronically infused with 3 or 10 nM per side of LSD during Pavlovian conditioning and then infused with DOI demonstrated a smaller increase in head bobs relative to controls. LSD produced its enhancement of Pavlovian conditioning through an effect on 5-HT(2A) receptors located in the dorsal hippocampus. The slight, short-lived enhancement of learning produced by LSD appears to be due to the development of desensitization of the 5-HT(2A) receptor within the hippocampus as a result of repeated administration of its agonist (LSD).",

Mr. A, 16 years old, had an unremarkable medical history, notable for the absence of a seizure disorder, and had been maintained without incident on a regimen of fluoxetine, 20 mg/day, for approximately 1 year. About 1 hr after consuming the second of two doses of \"blotter\" LSD (and 3 hr after the initial dose), he developed marked stupor. Emergency services were summoned. In transport to the hospital, the patient was observed to develop an apparent focal seizure involving the left arm and face, which progressed to a grand mal convulsion and responded to 10 mg i.v. of diazepam.",

Arteriography revealed diffuse spasm of all arteries of the lower limbs associated with localized spasm along the profunda artery in particular. These appearances regressed on control angiography performed 10 days later. The treatment which associated volume expanders and intravenous vasodilatation agents (magnesium sulfate) led to rapid improvement in the clinical condition in 3 days. There were no long-term complications. The causative role of LSD was suggested by the history of greatly increased intake in the period before the onset of symptoms. LSD is a derivative of lysergic acid, the common nucleus of the derivative of the ergot of rye. Analysis of a sample dose taken by the patient showed a very large quantity of LSD and of lysergic acid and a very small amount of other ergot alkaloids known for their peripheral vasoconstrictor effects. ...",

The threshold dose of LSD was determined to be 20 ug or 0.260 to 0.295 ug/kg. Chlorpromazine, in a dose of 25 mg., given 30 min beforehand or phenoxybenzamine, in a 10 mg. dose, given at the same time blocked recognition of the dose of LSD, i.e., raised the threshold. The same dose of chlorpromazine when given at the same time as or 30 minutes after LSD did not block recognition. Neither chlorpromazine in this dosage nor phenoxybenzamine in doses up to 30 mg. had any significant physiologic or subjective effect. The results suggest that the mechanisms through which these compounds block the recognition of LSD are different from those producing their peripheral autonomic effects.",

The threshold dose of LSD was determined to be 20 ug or 0.260 to 0.295 ug/kg. Chlorpromazine, in a dose of 25 mg., given 30 min beforehand or phenoxybenzamine, in a 10 mg. dose, given at the same time blocked recognition of the dose of LSD, i.e., raised the threshold. The same dose of chlorpromazine when given at the same time as or 30 minutes after LSD did not block recognition. Neither chlorpromazine in this dosage nor phenoxybenzamine in doses up to 30 mg. had any significant physiologic or subjective effect. The results suggest that the mechanisms through which these compounds block the recognition of LSD are different from those producing their peripheral autonomic effects.",

Hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD can be used to induce profoundly altered states of consciousness, and it is thus of interest to test the effects of these drugs on this system. 100 ug LSD was administrated orally to 20 healthy participants prior to fMRI assessment. Whole brain thalamic functional connectivity was measured using ROI-to-ROI and ROI-to-voxel approaches. Correlation analyses were used to explore relationships between thalamic connectivity to regions involved in auditory and visual hallucinations and subjective ratings on auditory and visual drug effects. LSD caused significant alterations in all dimensions of the 5D-ASC scale and significantly increased thalamic functional connectivity to various cortical regions. Furthermore, LSD-induced functional connectivity measures between the thalamus and the right fusiform gyrus and insula correlated significantly with subjective auditory and visual drug effects. Hallucinogenic drug effects might be provoked by facilitations of cortical excitability via thalamocortical interactions. Our findings have implications for the understanding of the mechanism of action of hallucinogenic drugs and provide further insight into the role of the 5-HT2A -receptor in altered states of consciousness.",

However, the interaction between 5-HT2AR activation, cognitive impairments and visual hallucinations is still poorly understood. This study explored the effect of 5-HT2AR activation on response inhibition neural networks in healthy subjects by using LSD and further tested whether brain activation during response inhibition under LSD exposure was related to LSD-induced visual hallucinations. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, LSD (100 ug) and placebo were administered to 18 healthy subjects. Response inhibition was assessed using a functional magnetic resonance imaging Go/No-Go task. LSD-induced visual hallucinations were measured using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire. Relative to placebo, LSD administration impaired inhibitory performance and reduced brain activation in the right middle temporal gyrus, superior/middle/inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex and in the left superior frontal and postcentral gyrus and cerebellum. Parahippocampal activation during response inhibition was differently related to inhibitory performance after placebo and LSD administration. Finally, activation in the left superior frontal gyrus under LSD exposure was negatively related to LSD-induced cognitive impairments and visual imagery. Our findings show that 5-HT2AR activation by LSD leads to a hippocampal-prefrontal cortex-mediated breakdown of inhibitory processing, which might subsequently promote the formation of LSD-induced visual imageries. These findings help to better understand the neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms of visual hallucinations in LSD-induced states and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

In severely poisoned cats, spontaneous action potentials have appeared in the ERG, with exaggerated responses to stimulation by light. Simultaneously, large spikes appeared in recording from the occipital visual cortex and these spikes disappeared when the optic nerves were cut, suggesting that this spontaneous visual activity originated in the retina. The ERG of excised ... cat or monkey retina has not been affected by lysergide. Behavior suggesting blindness has been observed in cats, pigeons, and monkeys under the influence of lysergide. In monkeys this has been interpreted as \"psychic blindness\" and has been associated with loss of contact with the surroundings and impairment of skilled movements involving oculomotor control. In cats that acted blind after large doses of lysergide, electrical potentials have been picked up in the CNS, showing that although there might be effects on retina and optic nerve the changes were insufficient to cause blindness.",

These build over the 90 day course of treatment and can persist at full strength for at least several months after cessation of treatment. The behaviors are consistent with those observed in animal models of schizophrenia and include hyperactivity, reduced sucrose-preference, and decreased social interaction. In order to elucidate molecular changes that underlie these aberrant behaviors, we chronically treated rats with LSD and performed RNA-sequencing on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area highly associated with both the actions of LSD and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses. We observed widespread changes in the neurogenetic state of treated animals four weeks after cessation of LSD treatment. QPCR was used to validate a subset of gene expression changes observed with RNA-Seq, and confirmed a significant correlation between the two methods. Functional clustering analysis indicates differentially expressed genes are enriched in pathways involving neurotransmission (Drd2, Gabrb1), synaptic plasticity (Nr2a, Krox20), energy metabolism (Atp5d, Ndufa1) and neuropeptide signaling (Npy, Bdnf), among others. Many processes identified as altered by chronic LSD are also implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and genes affected by LSD are enriched with putative schizophrenia genes. Our results provide a relatively comprehensive analysis of mPFC transcriptional regulation in response to chronic LSD, and indicate that the long-term effects of LSD may bear relevance to psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia.",

All five matched controls, given saline injections, went to term and delivered healthy litters of 11 to 16 offspring; there were no abortions and no stillbirths. In a replicate experiment, one of five rats given LSD on the 4th day of gestation aborted, two delivered some stillborn offspring, one gave an abnormally small litter of four, and the last one produced an apparently normal litter of ten. All matched controls delivered healthy litters, totaling 66. Some surviving offspring treated with LSD failed to develop as well as control animals. Treatment of five additional rats with LSD late in pregnancy had no obvious effect on the offspring.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.0X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates LSD will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase LSD will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 53 minutes. Particulate-phase LSD will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. LSD absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, LSD is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 280. The estimated pKa of LSD is 7.80, indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-16 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected to be an important process for the ionized form because cations do not volatilize. LSD is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, LSD adsorbs to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A pKa of 7.80 indicates LSD will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization of the ionized from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 40 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to LSD may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where LSD is produced or used. However, occupational exposure to LSD should be low or non-existent since LSD is not legally produced in the US. Exposure to LSD among the general population is likely limited to individuals who engage in illicit use of products containing LSD. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Assessment of their concentration in different environmental compartments is essential to evaluate their potential ecotoxicological effects. It also constitutes an indirect tool to estimate drug abuse by the population at the community level. The present work reports for the first time the occurrence of drugs of abuse and metabolites residues along the Ebro River basin (NE Spain) and also evaluates the contribution of sewage treatment plants (STPs) effluents to the presence of these chemicals in natural surface waters. Concentrations measured in influent sewage waters were used to back calculate drug usage at the community level in the main urban areas of the investigated river basin. The most ubiquitous and abundant compounds in the studied aqueous matrices were cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ephedrine and ecstasy. Lysergic compounds, heroin, its metabolite 6-monoacetyl morphine, and Delta(9)-tetradhydrocannabinol were the substances less frequently detected. Overall, total levels of the studied illicit drugs and metabolites observed in surface water (in the low ng/L range) were one and two orders of magnitude lower than those determined in effluent (in the ng/L range) and influent sewage water (microg/L range), respectively. The investigated STPs showed overall removal efficiencies between 45 and 95%. Some compounds, such as cocaine and amphetamine, were very efficiently eliminated (>90%) whereas others, such as ecstasy, methamphetamine, nor-LSD, and THC-COOH where occasionally not eliminated at all. Drug consumption estimates pointed out cocaine as the most abused drug, followed by cannabis, amphetamine, heroin, ecstasy and methamphetamine, which slightly differs from national official estimates (cannabis, followed by cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamine and heroin). Extrapolation of the consumption data obtained for the studied area to Spain points out a total annual consumption of drugs of abuse of the order of 36 tonnes, which would translate into 1100 million Euros in the black market.",

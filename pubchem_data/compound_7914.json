When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 149 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isopropyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase isopropyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hours. The vapor phase reactions of isopropyl ether with nitrate radicals corresponds to a half-life of 9 seconds. Direct photolysis will not be an important removal process since aliphatic ethers do not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm. If released to soil, isopropyl ether is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 160. It may be resistant to biodegradation in environmental media based upon screening test data from studies using activated sludge or sewage inocula. Many ethers are known to be resistant to biodegradation. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces may be important given the vapor pressure of this compound. If released into water, isopropyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based on the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based on its estimated Henry's Law constant. The volatilization half-life from a model river and a model lake is estimated as approximately 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 8 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Isopropyl ether is not expected to hydrolyze in the environment due to lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. The most probable routes of general population exposure to isopropyl ether are via handling of paints and stain removers, inhalation of contaminated air and ingestion of contaminated drinking water. Exposure through dermal contact may occur in occupational settings. Inhalation and dermal exposure will be expected to be highest in workplaces where isopropyl ether is made and used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of isopropyl ether from moist soil surfaces is expected to be important(3,SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its water solubility(4) and vapor pressure(5). The potential for volatilization of isopropyl ether from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based on a vapor pressure of 149 mm Hg(5). Isopropyl ether is not expected to hydrolyze in soil due to lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). Aqueous screening test data from studies using activated sludge or sewage inocula(6,7) suggest that isopropyl ether may be resistant to biodegradation in environmental media(SRC). Many ethers are known to be resistant to biodegradation(8).",

Isopropyl ether is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3,SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its water solubility(4) and vapor pressure(5). Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively(3,SRC). Isopropyl ether is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). Isopropyl ether will not significantly photooxidize via reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals in the water(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 8(3,SRC), from isopropyl ether's log Kow(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Isopropyl ether may be resistant to biodegradation in environmental media based upon screening test data from studies using activated sludge or sewage inocula(8,9,SRC). Many ethers are known to be resistant to biodegradation(10).",

Vapor-phase isopropyl ether is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hours(3,SRC). The half-life for the reaction of isopropyl ether with nitrate radicals is estimated as 9 seconds(4,SRC). Direct photolysis will not be an important removal process since aliphatic ethers do not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Cefepime is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and has greater activity against both compared to third-generation antibiotics. Cefepime is normally used to treat severe nosocomial pneumonia and infections caused by multi-resistant microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and is also indicated for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. The popularity of its third-generation predecessors, its clinical efficacy, and the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria might be some of the factors leading to an increase in the use of cefepime. The activity of cefepime against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus is due to its high stability toward beta-lactamases. In general, cefepime seems to be well tolerated; however, patients treated with this antibiotic, especially those with renal impairment, may develop neurotoxicity.",

It is active against Gram-negative bacteria such as _Enterobacter_ spp., _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Proteus mirabilis_ and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and Gram-positive bacteria such as _Staphylococcus aureus_ (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Streptococcus pyogenes_ and Viridans group streptococci. Compared to third-generation cephalosporins, cefepime has an extended Gram-negative coverage. Whereas other cephalosporins are degraded by plasmid- and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamases, cefepime is stable and not significantly hydrolyzed by these enzymes. Cefepime is also a poor inducer of type 1 beta-lactamases and, therefore, a good alternative against bacteria resistant to third-generation cephalosporins.   In animal models of infection, the time that the unbound plasma concentration of cefepime exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of infecting organisms has been shown to correlate with treatment efficacy. It has been suggested that cefepime can cross the inflamed blood-brain barrier. This, along with its ability to inhibit \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), could lead to the neurotoxic effects observed in some of the patients treated with cefepime.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

This results in the lysis and death of susceptible microorganisms. Cefepime has a broad spectrum of _in vitro_ activity that includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cefepime has affinity for PBP-3 and PBP-1 in _Escherichia coli_ and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, as well as PBP-2 in _E. coli_ and _Enterobacter cloacae_.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

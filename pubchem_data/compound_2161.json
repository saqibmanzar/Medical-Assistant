PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

It decreases the time ulcers take to heal. Because amlexanox decreases the healing time, it also decreases the pain you feel. Recent studies have also shown that the majority of ulcers can be prevented by application of the paste during the prodromal (pre-ulcerative) phase of the disease. Recurrent Aphthous Ulcers (RAU) also known as Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) is recognized as the most common oral mucosal disease known to man. Estimates suggest that 20% - 25% of the general population suffer at least one incidence of aphthous ulcers each year. Amlexanox is also being investigated for its anti-allergenic and anti-inflammatory properties.",

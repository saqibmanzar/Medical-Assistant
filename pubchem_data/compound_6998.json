For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The ratio of 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol can be altered by varying the catalyst. The oxidation of the hydroxybenzyl alcohols is carried out in an aqueous solution with a platinum-lead-carbon catalyst and gives the corresponding hydroxybenzaldehydes in yields of more than 98%.",

Moderate yields of 2-hydroxy- and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde are obtained in a ratio of about 85:15. The use of aqueous methanol as a reaction medium improves the yield, especially that of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. According to a modern variation of the Reimer-Tiemann reaction, the process is carried out in the absence of water. An alkali-metal phenolate reacts with chloroform and a suspension of an alkali-metal hydroxide in an inert organic solvent.",

Aldehydes can react with air to give first peroxo acids, and ultimately carboxylic acids. These autoxidation reactions are activated by light, catalyzed by salts of transition metals, and are autocatalytic (catalyzed by the products of the reaction). The addition of stabilizers (antioxidants) to shipments of aldehydes retards autoxidation.",

It is used in analytical chemistry, perfumery (violet), synthesis of coumarin, as an auxiliary fumigant, and flavoring. HUMAN STUDIES: An elk researcher who had handled leaves from various trees presented with eczema of the hands, face, flexures, trunk and extremities. Patch testing showed sensitivity to salicyl alcohol, salicylaldehyde, balsam of Peru (Myroxylon pereirae resin), aspen wood dust and an extract prepared from the bark of aspen (Populus tremula). Besides salicyl alcohol, salicylaldehyde is also recommended to be used to screen for contact allergy to aspen. Both of these chemicals should be tested in forest workers in areas where aspen is growing. ANIMAL STUDIES: Salicylaldehyde fed to male rats for 10 days or more caused an increase in the number and size of hepatic and renal microbodies and caused fibrillar material to appear. The drug did not cause fibrillar material to appear in hepatic microbodies of mice or microbodies of transplantable rat hepatomas. Salicylaldehyde evoked a hypocalcemia in rats and mice. Salicylaldehyde and its acetyl derivatives are all less potent analgesics and antinflammatory agents in rodents than salicylic acid and aspirin.",

There is 1 previous report of allergic contact dermatitis from salicyl alcohol in aspen bark. We describe a second case with concomitant allergy to salicylaldehyde. An elk researcher who had handled leaves from various trees presented with eczema of the hands, face, flexures, trunk and extremities. Patch testing showed sensitivity to salicyl alcohol, salicylaldehyde, balsam of Peru (Myroxylon pereirae resin), aspen wood dust and an extract prepared from the bark of aspen (Populus tremula). Weaker reactions were observed to bark extracts of rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia) and goat willow (Salix caprea). We analyzed salicyl alcohol and salicylaldehyde in the bark extracts and found the 2 chemicals in equal amounts, about 0.9 ug/mg in aspen bark and in lower concentrations in rowan and the willows. We did not find either of the chemicals in the test substance of balsam of Peru (Myroxylon pereirae). Besides salicyl alcohol, salicylaldehyde is also recommended to be used to screen for contact allergy to aspen. Both of these chemicals should be tested in forest workers in areas where aspen is growing.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.93X10-1 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 hours. 2-Hydroxybenzaldehyde contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 73. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Hydroxybenzaldehyde has a vapor pressure of 5.93X10-1 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde may volatilize from dry soil. Utilizing an inherent biodegradation test complete degradation was observed indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 57 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, inhalation of wood smoke, ingestion of plants or food products containing 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and dermal contact with plants and plant oils and consumer products containing 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

According to a classification scheme(8), an estimated BCF of 7(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that salicylaldehyde is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 57 days(SRC). 2-Hydroxybenzaldehyde's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of salicylaldehyde from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure close to one and the compound exists as an odorous liquid under environmental conditions.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Merphos is found on List B. Case No: 2385; Pesticide type: Fungicide, herbicide; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products.

It may also be released during its production, transport, formulation, and disposal. If released on soil, merphos would be expected to adsorb strongly to soil and be oxidized to S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF). If released in water, merphos will hydrolyze to DEF, a reaction that occured within an hour in the Little Miami River. If released into the atmosphere during spraying operations, merphos will exist as an aerosol and be removed by gravitational settling and be oxidized to DEF in the drifting spray. Vapor-phase merphos will react with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, resulting in an estimated half-life of 4.9 hr. Exposure to merphos would be primarily occupational by inhalation of aerosols or by dermal contact during spraying. The general population may be exposed to merphos in food. (SRC)",

Merphos will also be oxidized in aerated water. The P(III) to P(V) oxidation is known to be a rapid one, requiring only the presence of oxygen(1). When 1 ug/L of merphos was added to raw water from the Little Miami River, all the merphos was oxidized to S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) within an hour(2). Merphos has a UV absorption band at 304 nm that extends to about 340 nm(3) and therefore merphos may undergo direct photolysis. In field transformation studies of merphos in spray drift, all of the merphos was oxidized to DEF by the time the spray drift had reached the first sampling station, which the authors say indicates a half-life of the order of seconds(1). The authors did not indicate that measures were taken to assure that the merphos was not oxidzed during sampling and analysis, which would affect their results of a half-life of the order of seconds(SRC). In the atmosphere, merphos will exist primarily as the vapor(4). There it will react with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a rate constant of 78.8X10-12 cu cm/molecule-s(5). Assuming a hydroxyl radical concn of 5X10+5 radicals/cu cm, the half-life of merphos in the atmosphere is estimated to be 4.9 hr(SRC). It is also slowly oxidized by the oxygen in air to tributyl trithiophosphate(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

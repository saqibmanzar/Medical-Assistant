Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

After metabolic activation to CEO /chloroethylene oxide/ by CYP2E1, VC exerts various genotoxic effects (including gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations) in different organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, mammalian cells in culture, Drosophila, rodents and humans. Among the mutagenic events induced by VC, base-pair substitutions appear, so far, to be the most frequent. VC in the presence of an activation system has a transforming activity on mammalian (rodent) cells in culture. Studies in vitro have demonstrated that metabolically activated VC and its electrophilic metabolites CEO and CAA /chloroacetaldehyde/ can alkylate nucleic acid bases. 7-OEG, the major DNA adduct formed by VC and CEO does not exhibit promutagenic properties. In contrast, four minor adducts, Epsilon A, Epsilon C, N2,3-Epsilon G and 1,N2-Epsilon G, show promutagenic properties, inducing mainly base-pair substitution mutations and a low level of frameshift mutations.",

These processes are advantageous in that they do not require the cost-intensive separation of acetylene-ethylene mixtures. The crack gas is fed directly to the hydrochlorinator, and the acetylene is converted to vinyl chloride, which is then separated from the remaining constituents. Because all of the acetylene is consumed, the remaining ethylene is more easily separated, or it can be introduced to a direct chlorination stage, where it is chlorinated to 1,2-dichloroethane, which is subsequently cracked to vinyl chloride. Because almost equimolar amounts of ethylene and acetylene can be achieved in the crack gas, the process can be balanced for chlorine.",

The nanoprobe demonstrates high selectivity to TDGA with about 27.5-fold luminescence enhancement. It also displays excellent sensitivity with a detection limit as low as 89 ng/mL and fast response to TDGA within 4 min, while refraining from the interference of other coexisting species in urine. Such good sensing performance enables the nanoprobe to practically monitor TDGA levels in human urine. Moreover, a portable urine dipstick based on the sensor is developed to conveniently evaluate individuals' intoxication degree of VCM. This fast, sensitive, and selective nanoprobe has promising potential to be a useful tool for point-of-care diagnosis of disease associated with VCM exposure.",

MAs are, therefore, suitable biomarkers of exposure to toxicants, which are either electrophiles by themselves or metabolized to electrophilic intermediates. We developed and validated two LC-MS/MS methods which allow the complementary, rapid, and sensitive determination of MAs derived from acrolein, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, crotonaldehyde, N,N-dimethylformamide, ethylene, ethylene oxide, vinyl chloride, propylene oxide, styrene, toluene as well as methylating and ethylating agents. Since separate determinations of single or small groups of MAs are time-consuming and expensive, we multiplexed several individual methods into two LC-MS/MS methods covering 18 individual mercapturic acids. Method validation according to FDA guidelines showed excellent results in terms of robustness, accuracy, and sensitivity of the methods. Moreover, the use of a minimal, simple, and straightforward sample cleanup procedure further accelerated the analytical workflow, which allows a time- and cost-efficient analysis of up to 18 MAs derived from various toxicants in environmental levels. The methods were applied to urine samples derived from a strictly diet-controlled clinical study, including 25 smoking and 25 non-smoking subjects. Significant increase in the urine concentrations in smokers as compared to non-smokers (p<0.01; Student t test) was observed for 13 individual MAs. Moreover, a dose dependence was obtained for the majority of the analytes. In conclusion, the newly developed assays represent a powerful tool for the fast and reliable quantification of 18 MAs in clinical studies. A first method application suggests several suitable biomarkers for nine relevant toxicants in tobacco smoke.",

[LaDou, p. 298-9] There is compelling evidence that exposure to vinyl chloride is associated with angiosarcoma of the liver, and strong evidence that it is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Together with the observation that vinyl chloride increases the risk for liver cirrhosis, which is a known risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, the findings from two large multicentre cohort studies provide convincing evidence that vinyl chloride causes hepatocellular carcinoma as well as angiosarcoma of the liver. [IARC Monograph 100F] There is limited evidence that vinyl chloride caused increased birth defects in exposed human populations.

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Sources of ignition, such as smoking and open flames, are prohibited where vinyl chloride is handled, used, or stored. Metal containers involving the transfer of 5 gallons of vinyl chloride should be grounded and bonded. Drums must be equipped with self-closing valves, pressure vacuum bungs, and flame arresters. Use only nonsparking tools and equipment, especially when opening and closing containers of vinyl chloride. Wherever vinyl chloride is used, handled, manufactured, or stored, use explosion-proof electrical equipment and fittings. Procedures for the handling, use, and storage of cylinders should be in compliance with OSHA 1910.101 and 1910.169, as with the recommendations of the Compressed Gas Association.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

                                "Description": "In general, the occupational exposure limit (OEL) indicates the level of admissible exposure, for a length of time (usually 8 hours), to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health of a worker. The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

This report details the investigation of exposures and symptoms among refinery workers. The investigation team met with refinery workers to discuss their experience after the derailment and provided workers a self-administered survey to document symptoms and worker responses during the incident. Associations among categorical variables and experiencing symptoms were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Twenty-six of 155 (17 percent) workers present at the refinery or driving on the access road the date the spill occurred completed the survey. Any self-reported symptom following exposure from the vinyl chloride release /was analyzed/. Fifteen workers (58 percent) reported >/=1 symptom, most commonly headache (12, 46 percent). Three (12 percent) reported using respiratory protection. No differences in reporting symptoms were observed by location during the incident or by the building in which workers sheltered. Workers who moved from one shelter to another during the incident (ie, broke shelter) were more likely to report symptoms (Fisher's exact test, p=0.03); however, there are only limited data regarding vinyl chloride concentrations in shelters versus outside. Breaking shelter might result in greater exposures, and managers and health and safety officers of vulnerable facilities with limited physical access should consider developing robust shelter-in-place plans and alternate emergency egress plans. Workers should consider using respiratory protection if exiting a shelter is necessary during a chemical incident.",

Four tank cars, including a breached tank car carrying vinyl chloride, landed in a tidal creek. Vinyl chloride, a colorless gas with a mild, sweet odor, is used in plastics manufacture. Acute exposure can cause respiratory irritation and headache, drowsiness, and dizziness; chronic occupational exposure can result in liver damage, accumulation of fat in the liver, and tumors (including angiosarcoma of the liver). Because health effects associated with acute exposures have not been well studied, the New Jersey Department of Health requested assistance from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and CDC. On December 11, teams from these agencies deployed to assist the New Jersey Department of Health in conducting an assessment of exposures in the community as well as the occupational health and safety of emergency personnel who responded to the incident. This report describes the results of the investigation of emergency personnel. A survey of 93 emergency responders found that 26% of respondents experienced headache and upper respiratory symptoms during the response. A minority (22%) reported using respiratory protection during the incident. Twenty-one (23%) of 92 respondents sought medical evaluation. Based on these findings, CDC recommended that response agencies 1) implement the Emergency Responder Health Monitoring and Surveillance (ERHMS) system for ongoing health monitoring of the emergency responders involved in the train derailment response and 2) ensure that in future incidents, respiratory protection is used when exposure levels are unknown or above the established occupational exposure limits.",

A total of 28 people received inpatient treatment in a nearby hospital, another 268 people were treated as outpatients. The typical symptoms of fume poisoning such as headache, nausea, irritations of respiratory tract and eyes were the primarily diagnosed problems. The vegetation was damaged by flue gases and developing HCl causing fire and caustic burns. Fire brigades and special task forces succeeded to control the looming danger of health and environmental hazards by cooling the burning wagons and pumping the liquid gases from the tank wagons. Vinyl chloride which was released over several days was measured in residential areas to be 0.06-8 mL/cu m air. Vinyl chloride is a gas which is heavier than air. When exposed to light it will be degraded within a few days. A technical guide concentration of 3 mL/cu m air has been adopted for its cancerogenic potential. Dioxin values measured in soils and plants were in the natural range of 20 ng/L-TE/kg DS. These values increased to 8300 ng at the very seat of the fire only. With the water used for fire fighting vinyl chloride penetrated into the groundwater revealing values of up to 73 mg/liter. A total of 292 urine samples taken from patients and members of the rescue forces, residents and a control group were tested for their contents of the VC metabolite thiodiacetic acid. However, this number does not allow to draw any conclusions with regard to a potential increase in the risk of cancer. With 0.27, 0.43 and 0.37 mg/liter of urine, the mean values are in the normal range for unexposed people. Only three cases showing values of up to 3.1 mg/liter indicated that a real exposure had taken place. The environmental and health authorities have evaluated the results of the measurements at site. ...",

Thereby, the human population living in this area was exposed to vinyl chloride and its byproducts. Chromosomal aberrations were measured in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 29 potentially exposed and 29 non-exposed (control) individuals. Both groups were matched regarding age, gender and smoking habits. 200 metaphases were analyzed for chromosomal aberrations/ each individual. The exposed group showed a statistically significant incr in the mean frequency of aberrant cells (1.47% versus 1.07% in the control group). Chromosomal aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes have been shown to be a very sensitive biomarker of genotoxic effects not only for occupational exposure to vinyl chloride ... , but also for an accidental environmental exposure.",

It is used in the plastics industry to manufacture polyvinyl chloride, and in organic syntheses. It has been used as refrigerant and spray can propellant. HUMAN STUDIES: Vinyl chloride causes angiosarcoma of the liver, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Past occupational exposure to several hundred ppm of vinyl chloride for periods ranging from one month to 3 years has been associated with development of \"vinyl chloride disease\". Vinyl chloride disease is characterized by acroosteolysis, a condition characterized by lytic lesions of bones (primarily of fingers), scleroderma of the connective tissue in the fingers with dermal thickening, and a Raynaud-like condition with reversible arteriole constriction causing numbness, pallor and cyanosis of the fingers. The attribution of acroosteolysis to vinyl chloride exposure is based almost entirely on case reports and has been estimated to affect <3% of workers involved in the polymerization of vinyl chloride. In patients with chronic occupational exposure, neurological disturbances include sensory-motor polyneuropathy, trigeminal sensory neuropathy, slight pyramidal signs and cerebellar and extrapyramidal motor disorders. Psychiatric disturbances included neurasthenic or depressive syndromes. Sleeplessness and loss of sexual functions were frequently encountered. Pathological EEG alterations were found in a high proportion of patients. A chronic hepatic disorder of porphyrin metabolism was found in 36 workers with vinyl chloride-induced hepatic injury following long-time industrial exposure. Pathologic porphyrinuria, especially secondary coproporphyrinuria with transition to subclinical chronic hepatic porphyria, is a consistent pathobiochemical parameter for the recognition of vinyl chloride hepatic lesions. The major immunological abnormalities reported in vinyl chloride disease patients include hyperimmunoglobulinemia with a polyclonal increase in IgG, cryoglobulinemia, cryofibrinogenemia, and in vivo activation of complement. Vinyl chloride is an occupational carcinogen which caused micronuclei in human cells. There was significant increase in chromosomal abnormalities in cultured peripheral lymphocytes from 57 male workers when compared with controls. Sister chromatid exchange was the more sensitive endpoint for indicating a biological response. ANIMAL STUDIES: Brief (30 minutes) exposures to concentrations of vinyl chloride ranging from 100,000 to 400,000 ppm have been shown to be fatal in rats, guinea pigs and mice. Symptoms of intoxication in rats and mice include muscular incoordination and twitching, CNS depression and respiratory failure. Intense salivation and lacrimation have been noted in rats, guinea pigs and rabbits exposed acutely to high concentrations (375-700 mg/L) of vinyl chloride gas. When placed on skin or in eyes, liquid vinyl chloride may freeze tissue and produce a chemical burn as it evaporates, causing damage to the underlying tissue. Profound CNS depression was reported in guinea-pigs exposed to vinyl chloride at 65,000 mg/cu m for 90 min. Ataxia was observed at this dose level after 5 min of exposure. The anesthetic action of vinyl chloride was also observed in dogs and mice. Investigators reported deep CNS depression in rats and mice exposed to 260,000 mg/cu m for 30 min. The CNS depressant effect was preceded by increased motor activity after 5 min of exposure, twitching of extremities (after 10 min), ataxia (after 15 min) and tremor (after 15 min). Rats exposed to 130,000 mg/cu m for 60 min showed ataxia preceded by hyperactivity but no /CNS depressant/ effect. Forty rabbits were exposed for 4 hours/day on 5 days/week for 12 months to air containing (10,000 ppm) vinyl chloride. Between 9 and 15 months exposure, 12 skin acanthomas and 6 lung adenocarcinomas were seen. No similar tumors occurred in 20 controls after 15 months observation. Rats were exposed to 10,000 ppm vinyl chloride in air for 4 hours/day on 5 days/week for 5 weeks, starting at the age of 13 weeks (120 rats per group) or 1 day (43 and 46 rats). Animals were observed for 135 weeks. One hepatoma was reported in the older rats in newborn rats, 10 angiosarcomas and 15 hepatomas were found. No liver tumors were reported in 249 controls. Vinyl chloride was administered for 7 hr/day on days 6-18 of gestation in mice, rats, and rabbits. It was concluded that although maternal toxicity observed, vinyl chloride alone did not cause significant embryonal or fetal toxicity and was not teratogenic in any of the species at concentrations tested. Vinyl chloride produced a significant increase in the frequency of recessive lethal mutations in male Drosophila melangaster. Mutagenic activity of vinyl chloride was reported in yeast (S. pombe and S. cerevisiae) in the presence of metabolic activation. Vinyl chloride was mutagenic to S. pombe in the \"host mediated\" assay when mice were treated with an oral dose of 700 mg/kg of vinyl chloride. Using Salmonella tester strains, direct mutagenicity of vinyl chloride was reported at 20% (v/v) in air (200,000 ppm) in the absence of metabolic activation. Mutagenic response was increased by metabolic activation. However, 20% vinyl chloride (v/v in air) was inactive in systems employing S. typhimurium strains TA1536, TA1537 and TA1538. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: In Daphnia magna exposure, results indicated impacts of vinyl chloride on the regulation of genes related to glutathione-S-transferase (GST), juvenile hormone esterase (JHE), and the vitelline outer layer membrane protein (VMO1).",

This is believed to be the result of a reactive vinyl chloride intermediate metabolite binding to an immunoglobulin, altering the protein and initiating an immune response. The metabolites of vinyl chloride, especially choloroethylene oxide, are mutagenic and act by covalently binding to DNA. This produces cyclic etheno-adducts, which cause base-pair transitions during transcription and DNA crosslinks. Metabolites also may cause oxidative stress and affecting tumor supressor genes, as vinyl chloride has been known to produce specific mutations in the p53 and Ki-ras genes. Vinyl chloride metabolites are also believed to exert toxic effects in the liver by covalently binding to liver proteins, resulting in cellular toxicity. (L3, A65)",

There was no significant effect on litter size, the number of implantation sites/dam or incidence of absorption in any of the exposed animals.

Some of the rabbits in the higher dose groups were also exposed to 15% ethanol in their drinking water (days 6-18). On day 29 of gestation the pregnant rabbits were sacrificed, and the fetuses examined for visceral and skeletal abnormalities. The dams were examined for corpora lutea, implantations, and intrauterine deaths. There was no effect on maternal weight gain or liver weight or food consumption in rabbits exposed to 2500 ppm vinyl chloride alone, but those exposed to a combination of vinyl chloride and alcohol showed a significant decrease in weight gain and food consumption. Exposure to vinyl chloride alone did not cause any change in the incidence of reabsorptions, but exposure to vinyl chloride plus ethanol caused a marked increase in the number of resorption. There were no differences in fetal body weight or crown-rump length in the exposed group. Delayed ossification was observed at all dose levels.",

In this study, 317 workers occupationally exposed to VC were recruited from a factory in Shandong Province, China. The micronucleus (MN) frequency in peripheral lymphocytes was used as an indicator of chromosomal damage. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and created restriction site combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism were used to determine the five single nucleotide polymorphisms in XRCC1 and APE1 genes in the base excision repair pathway. The association of chromosomal damage with these polymorphisms and the haplotype of XRCC1 was analyzed using Poisson regression and PHASE 2.0.2. It was found that among the VC-exposed workers, individuals with XRCC1 polymorphisms (-77C/T, Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) had a significantly higher MN frequency than those with homozygous wild-type genotypes, with frequency ratios (FR) as follows, respectively: FR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.05~1.39 (P < 0.05); FR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.00~1.38 (P < 0.05); FR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.11~1.44 (P < 0.05); FR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.08~1.46 (P < 0.05). APE1 Asp148Glu was found of no significant relationship with MN frequency. Haplotype analysis of XRCC1 demonstrated that the MN frequencies in subjects with CTAA/CTAA and CCAA/CTAA were significantly higher than that in those with TCGG/TCGG (FR = 1.19, 95%CI: 1.02~1.32, P < 0.05; FR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.02?1.87, P < 0.05). Furthermore, association was found between accumulated exposure to VC and XRCC1 polymorphisms (-77C/T, Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) after adjustment for age, sex, drinking, and smoking. VC can induce chromosomal damage even when the exposure level is lower than the national occupational health standard of China (PC-TWA: 10 mg/cu m); the polymorphisms in XRCC1 and APE1 are associated with chromosomal damage induced by VC.",

Vinyl chloride (VC) is primarily used to manufacture polyvinyl chloride and can also be a degradation product of TCE. Very few data exist on the toxicity of TCE and VC in aquatic organisms particularly at environmentally relevant concentrations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sub-lethal effects (10 day exposure; 0.1; 1; 10 ug/L) of TCE and VC in Daphnia magna at the gene, cellular, and life-history levels. Results indicated impacts of VC on the regulation of genes related to glutathione-S-transferase (GST), juvenile hormone esterase (JHE), and the vitelline outer layer membrane protein (VMO1). On the cellular level, exposure to 0.1, 1, and 10 ug/L of VC significantly increased the activity of JHE in D. magna and TCE increased the activity of chitinase (at 1 and 10 ug/L). Results for life-history parameters indicated a possible tendency of TCE to affect the number of molts at the individual level in D. magna (p=0.051). Measurement of VG-like proteins using the alkali-labile phosphates (ALP) assay did not show differences between TCE treated organisms and controls. However, semi-quantitative measurement using gradient gel electrophoresis (213-218 kDa) indicated significant decrease in VG-like protein levels following exposure to TCE at all three concentrations. Overall, results indicate effects of TCE and VC on genes and proteins related to metabolism, reproduction, and growth in D. magna.",

It is reported to be in tobacco smoke. Vinyl chloride is also an anaerobic biodegradation product of higher chlorinated compounds such as tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2980 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates vinyl chloride will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase vinyl chloride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 2.3 and 46 days, respectively. Vinyl chloride, exposed to light >290 nm for 17 hours was photo-degraded 15.3%. If released to soil, vinyl chloride is expected to have high mobility based upon a Koc of 57. Volatilization of vinyl chloride from soil has reported half-lives of 0.2-0.5 days at soil depths of 1 and 10 cm, respectively. Vinyl chloride may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Vinyl chloride had a biodegradation rate of 1.456 ug/g soil/hr in soil. Vinyl chloride was degraded approximately 20-50% and 55-100% in 4 and 11 weeks, respectively, under anaerobic conditions in laboratory scale soil experiments. If released into water, vinyl chloride is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. The biodegradation half-life of vinyl chloride in aerobic and anaerobic waters was reported as 28 and 110 days, respectively. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant of 0.0278 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 3 days, respectively. A BCF of <10, measured in fish, suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Vinyl chloride is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment based on reported hydrolysis half-lives of >9.91 to >107 years. Occupational exposure to vinyl chloride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where vinyl chloride is produced or used. Exposure of the general public to vinyl chloride is expected to be very low. (SRC)",

The volatilization half-life of vinyl chloride was estimated as 0.2 days when incorporated in a soil at a depth of 1 cm and 0.5 days at a depth of 10 cm(4). Vinyl chloride is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 2980 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5). Vinyl chloride had a biodegradation rate of 1.456 ug/g soil/hr in soil from Skellingsted landfill in Holback, Denmark, incubated with methane(6). Vinyl chloride was degraded approximately 50% and 100% in 4 and 11 weeks, respectively, in the presence of sand by methanogenic microorganisms under anaerobic conditions in laboratory scale experiments(7). In the absence of sand 20% and 55% degradation occurred in 4 and 11 weeks, respectively(7). [",

The resultant vinyl chloride is further reduced to ethene, but the dechlorination of vinyl chloride to ethene is very slow and as a result an accumulation of vinyl chloride is noticed(1). Vinyl chloride was approximately 50% and 100% degraded in 4 and 11 weeks, respectively, in the presence of sand by methanogenic microorganisms under anaerobic conditions in laboratory scale experiments(3). In the absence of sand 20% and 55% degradation occurred in 4 and 11 weeks, respectively(3). Estimated first-order anaerobic biodegradation rate constants of vinyl chloride were reported to range from 0.0062 to 0.00096/day(4), corresponding to half-lives in the range of 112 to 722 days(SRC). The biodegradation half-life of vinyl chloride in anaerobic waters was reported as 110 days(5). Vinyl chloride, present at 330 ug/L, was completely biodegraded in 84 and 204 days using a chloroethene-contaminated sediment/groundwater (Copenhagen, Denmark, workshop for locomotive engines) inoculum amended with methane and oxygen, respectively(6). Using a chloroethene-contaminated sediment/groundwater (Frederikssund Denmark, industrial area), vinyl chloride was completely biodegraded in 57 days(6).",

These chlorinated daughter products temporarily accumulated, but complete removal was observed within 34 days. Anaerobic mineralization of vinyl chloride to carbon dioxide or to carbon dioxide and methane has been observed in laboratory experiments under iron-reducing, sulfate-reducing, humic acid-reducing, and methanogenic conditions. Both methanogens and the dehalorespiring bacteria were implicated in vinyl chloride degradation reactions. Higher vinyl chloride degradation was associated with an increase in the proportion of Methanosarcinaceae (utilize acetate to generate methane)(1).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Vinyl chloride was detected in 11% of 214 groundwater samples from 30 industrial sites in samples collected in 1999 in Taiwan(2). Vinyl chloride was detected in groundwater wells in Bitterfeld, East Germany in the upper and lower tertiary aquifer levels at 1-2800 and 1-5400 ug/L, respectively(3). After a train derailment in Manitoba on Mar 10, 1980, in which large amounts of vinyl chloride was spilled in the snow, a maximum of 10 ppm occurred in groundwater which decreased to below 0.02 ppm by 10 weeks after the spill(4). Concentrations in an anaerobic aquifer beneath a workshop for locomotive engines in Copenhagen, Denmark were <0.1-27 ug/L(5). Samples in an anaerobic aquifer beneath an industrial area in Frederikssund, Denmark contained vinyl chloride ranging from <0.3 to 31,000 ug/L; sampling was conducted in 1997 and 2000(5). Vinyl chloride was detected in groundwater samples collected (sampling dates not reported) from 37 wells at a closed dry-cleaning facility site that operated from mid-1940's to 1987 at <0.05-52.6 umol/L(6). Vinyl chloride was detected at a maximum of 1093 ug/L in groundwater samples from Italy as reported in 47 studies published 1997 to 2013(7).",

A national screening program for US water supplies showed that 7 of 142 samples contained vinyl chloride at a maximum concentration of 76 ppb(3). A contaminated drinking water well located in New York contained 50 ppb vinyl chloride(4). In a 2006 national drinking water survey, conducted by the US Geological Service, vinyl chloride was detected in 1 of 1208 (0.083%) drinking well water samples from data collected 1985 to 2002(5). Drinking water from PVC pipes contained 1.4 ppb vinyl chloride in a recent installation, while a 9 yr old system had 0.03-0.06 ppb(6). The concentration of vinyl chloride in various brands of bottled water was 0.6 ppb or less(7).

Vinyl chloride was detected at a maximum concentration of 9.8 ppb (1981) in a 9 state US survey(2-3). In a National water-quality assessment program run on surface water samples from across the country, vinyl chloride was detected in 2 of the 372 samples studied at 0.45 and 1.4 ug/L(4). Vinyl chloride was identified, not quantified, in 21 of 606 surface water samples from New Jersey(5). Vinyl chloride was detected in 3 of 28 samples from rivers and estuaries in Osaka, Japan at an average concentration of 0.64 ug/L(6). Samples taken from Taishogawa and Hiranogawa rivers in Osaka, Japan had reported vinyl chloride concentrations of 0.64-55.6 ug/L in 83 of 106 samples, samples were collected 1995 to 1997, highest concentration was reported from the upper part of Taishogawa River in July 1997(7).",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Twenty female and 20 male rats received sublethal, 1-hour, daily inhalation exposures of polytetrafluoroethylene pyrolysis products at 52, 43, 29, 25, and 9 ppm of carbonyl fluoride. Nine rats (22%) died during or shortly after completion of the five 1-hour exposures. The signs of toxicity preceding death indicated extreme malaise and weakness in the rats. The fluoride in the urine of the exposed rats increased from 3 to 42 mg/L in 5 days. Protein, glucose, ketones, and occult blood were detected in the urine. The succinic dehydrogenase activity in the kidney was inhibited to less than 5% of its normal value. The lung tissue reacted after the fifth day of exposure to produce increased amounts of succinic dehydrogenase enzyme to compensate for the fluoride inhibitory effect. The liver of exposed rats showed enlarged nuclei and fatty infiltration of the cells. Marked body weight loss (30%) occurred subsequent to exposures, indicating that metabolism was inhibited. The significant increase in the urinary fluoride coincident with the period of weight loss and the period of weight recovery coincident with the elimination of fluoride are evidence for a cause and effect relationship between fluoride toxicity and the body metabolism. Although severe injury was inflicted on the rats, the metabolic inhibition observed was completely reversible, and with the exception of a small amount of emphysematous changes, all previously mentioned pathologic changes in the lungs, the liver, and the kidneys were reversible within 18 days following exposure. Based on these results, the authors concluded that the toxic syndrome of carbonyl fluoride inhalation present in the pyrolysis product of polytetrafluoroethylene is compatible with descriptions of hydrogen fluoride poisoning.",

A 48-hour, postexposure picture of the lung of a rat showed rapid cellular reorganization and clearing of edema from the lung. The alveolar damage did not resolve as readily.

The LC50 determinations were for a 1 hr exposure followed by a 14 day, postexposure, observation period. Each test group consisted of 10 rats, 5 female and 5 male. To determine the effects of age, test groups of both 8- and 24-week old rats were used. The LC50 values for the 8- and 24-week-old rats were 360 and 460 ppm, respectively. The results of this study indicated that young rats were more susceptible than older rats to the toxic action of carbonyl fluoride. To determine the effect of exposure duration, a test group of 8-week-old rats was exposed at 90 ppm of carbonyl fluoride for 4 hours. The mortality was equal to that in the LC50 obtained in the 1-hour exposure at 360 ppm of carbonyl fluoride. This mortality indicates that the lethal effect is a function of the exposure concentration (C) times the time (t) of exposure, and that this exposure-concentration range (Ct), 1-4 hours, is a constant. No significant difference in mortality between the sexes was observed. The deaths produced usually occurred in 24-48 hours after termination of exposure.",

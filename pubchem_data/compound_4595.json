Commonly formulated as oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (ODT), and injections, and available as generic products as well, ondansetron continues to see contemporary innovations in its formulation and use, including the development of orally soluble films that are both discreet in administration and less of a burden in comparison to having patients attempt to swallow pills during emesis.  The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all intravenous drug products containing more than 16 mg of ondansetron hydrochloride in a single dose, due to a high risk of QT prolongation.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected prior to IV administration of ondansetron. Because effects of ondansetron on the QT interval are dose related, use of single IV doses exceeding 16 mg should be avoided. Patients receiving ondansetron should be advised to seek immediate medical care if feelings of faintness, lightheadedness, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, or dizziness occur.",

The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema,. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract,. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting,.  Moreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose.  An ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0). The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations.   In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron in healthy cats. Six cats with normal complete blood count, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis received 2 mg oral (mean 0.43 mg/kg), subcutaneous (mean 0.4 mg/kg), and intravenous (mean 0.4 mg/kg) ondansetron in a cross-over manner with a 5-day wash out. Serum was collected prior to, and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hr after administration of ondansetron. Ondansetron concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic modeling and dose interval modeling were performed. Repeated measures anova was used to compare parameters between administration routes. Bioavailability of ondansetron was 32% (oral) and 75% (subcutaneous). Calculated elimination half-life of ondansetron was 1.84 + or - 0.58 hr (intravenous), 1.18 + or - 0.27 hr (oral) and 3.17 + or - 0.53 hr (subcutaneous). The calculated elimination half-life of subcutaneous ondansetron was significantly longer (P < 0.05) than oral or intravenous administration. Subcutaneous administration of ondansetron to healthy cats is more bioavailable and results in a more prolonged exposure than oral administration. This information will aid management of emesis in feline patients.",

Because of the nature of the symptoms, oral delivery is inappropriate, while intravenous administration may be unpractical. The aim of the present study was to develop a transdermal gel (2% Klucel) for ondansetron, a first line 5-HT3-receptor-antagonist antiemetic. The effects of the penetration enhancer camphor and isopropyl-myristate (IPM) were first investigated in-vitro using modified Franz diffusion-cells and then tested in-vivo in a rabbit model by measuring skin and plasma concentrations. Since a disadvantage of transdermal delivery is a prolonged lag-time, the effect of skin treatment with a micro-needle roller was tested. The in-vitro permeation studies through excised porcine ear skin showed that the presence of 2.5% camphor or IPM increased steady state flux by 1.2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, compared to the control gel. Ondansetron was not detectable in either skin or plasma following in-vivo application of the base-gel, whereas the camphor gel and IPM gel delivered 20 and 81 ug/sq cm of ondansetron, respectively. Microporation led to an increase in plasma Cmax and AUC by 10.47 + or - 1.68-fold and 9.31 + or - 4.91-fold, respectively, for the camphor gel, and by 2.31 + or -0.53-fold and 1.59 + or - 0.38-fold, respectively for the IPM gel. In conclusion, the 2.5% IPM gel demonstrated optimal in-vivo transdermal flux. Skin pretreatment with a micro-needle roller slightly improved the delivery of the IPM gel, whereas dramatically increased the transdermal delivery of the camphor gel.",

The aim of this study was to perform a pharmacokinetic analysis of ondansetron in dogs following oral administration of a single dose. A single 8-mg oral dose of ondansetron was administered to beagles (n = 18), and the plasma concentrations of ondansetron were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The data were analyzed by modeling approaches using ADAPT5, and model discrimination was determined by the likelihood-ratio test. The peak plasma concentration (Cmax ) was 11.5 +/- 10.0 ng/mL at 1.1 +/- 0.8 hr. The area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration was 15.9 +/- 14.7 ng hr/mL, and the half-life calculated from the terminal phase was 1.3 +/- 0.7 hr. The interindividual variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters was high (coefficient of variation > 44.1%), and the one-compartment model described the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron well. The estimated plasma concentration range of the usual empirical dose from the Monte Carlo simulation was 0.1-13.2 ng/mL. These findings will facilitate determination of the optimal dose regimen for dogs with CINV.",

The pharmacokinetics of ondansetron have not been characterized in pregnant women or in newborns. A nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach was used to analyze plasma samples obtained from 20 nonpregnant and 40 pregnant women following a single administration of 4 or 8 mg ondansetron, from umbilical cord blood at delivery, and from neonates after birth. The analysis indicates that: ondansetron disposition is not affected by pregnancy (P > 0.05), but influenced by dose (P < 0.05), and is characterized by rapid transplacental transfer and longer elimination half-life in neonates compared to their mother. A dosing regimen for prevention of NAS was designed based on the model. The regimen involves IV administration of 4 mg to the mothers shortly before cord clamping, or oral administration of 0.07 mg/kg (or equivalently 0.04 mg/kg IV) to neonates.",

In terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 played the predominant role. Because of the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolizing ondansetron, it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme (e.g. CYP2D6 enzyme deficiency) will be compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron clearance.  Following oral or IV administration, ondansetron is extensively metabolised and excreted in the urine and faeces. In humans, less than 10% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The major urinary metabolites are glucuronide conjugates (45%), sulphate conjugates (20%) and hydroxylation products (10%). The primary metabolic pathway is subsequently hydroxylation on the indole ring followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both.  Although the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established.",

It is a drug used for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in both human and veterinary cases. Prolongation of the QT interval and cases of torsades de pointes have been reported in patients receiving ondansetron. Liver failure and death have been reported rarely in patients with cancer receiving ondansetron concomitantly with other drugs, including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. Ondansetron hydrochloride may cause a serious anaphylactic reaction. In a study of children whose mothers received promethazine or ondansetron during pregnancy, no clinically significant adverse neurobehavioral effects or obstetric outcomes were identified. According to a different study, the teratogenic risk with ondansetron is low but an increased risk for a cardiac septum defect is likely. There was also no evidence of damage to genetic material noted in in vitro chromosome aberration tests using human peripheral lymphocytes. ANIMAL STUDIES: Ondansetron was administered orally to rats at doses of 1, 4, and 15 mg/kg during gametogenesis, mating, pregnancy, and lactation periods. It is proposed that the maximum noneffective dose of ondansetron was 4 and 15 mg/kg with respect to general toxicity and reproductive capacity in F0 animals respectively. The maximum noneffective dose with respect to development in F1 and F2 animals was suggested to be 15 mg/kg. After IV administration of 0.5, 1.5, and 4 mg/kg of ondansetron daily during gestation and lactation period, the results suggest that the maximum noneffective dose of ondansetron for general toxicity in dams was 1.5 mg/kg and that for reproduction toxicity in dams and developmental toxicity in fetuses and offspring was 4 mg/kg. A slight maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose level in intravenous organogenesis (4.0 mg/kg/day) studies in the rabbit. Effects included maternal body weight loss and increased incidence of early fetal death. There was no evidence of damage to genetic material noted in in vitro V-79 mammalian cell mutation studies or in vivo chromosome aberration assays in mouse bone marrow. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in microbial mutagen tests using mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with or without a rat liver post-mitochondrial metabolizing system. Carcinogenic effects were not seen in 2-year studies in rats and mice with oral ondansetron doses up to 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively.",

This inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone.",

Use of ondansetron in nursing mothers beyond the immediate postpartum setting has not been studied well, but the drug is labeled for use in infants as young as 1 month of age.

Ondansetron has also been prescribed during pregnancy to help with symptoms of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP). NVP is also referred to as \u201cmorning sickness\u201d. Ondansetron is taken by mouth, infused into a vein (by IV) or given by injection into a muscle (IM). Ondansetron is sold under the brand name Zofran\u00ae.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.",

Human organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATEs) work in concert in the elimination of cationic drugs such as cisplatin from the kidney. We hypothesized that co-administration of ondansetron would have an effect on cisplatin nephrotoxicity by altering the function of cisplatin transporters. The inhibitory potencies of ondansetron on metformin accumulation mediated by OCT2 and MATEs were determined in the stable HEK-293 cells expressing these transporters. The effects of ondansetron on drug disposition in vivo were examined by conducting the pharmacokinetics of metformin, a classical substrate for OCTs and MATEs, in wild-type and Mate1-/- mice. The nephrotoxicity was assessed in the wild-type and Mate1-/- mice received cisplatin with and without ondansetron. Both MATEs, including human MATE1, human MATE2-K, and mouse Mate1, and OCT2 (human and mouse) were subject to ondansetron inhibition, with much greater potencies by ondansetron on MATEs. Ondansetron significantly increased tissue accumulation and pharmacokinetic exposure of metformin in wild-type but not in Mate1-/- mice. Moreover, ondansetron treatment significantly enhanced renal accumulation of cisplatin and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity which were indicated by increased levels of biochemical and molecular biomarkers and more severe pathohistological changes in mice. Similar increases in nephrotoxicity were caused by genetic deficiency of MATE function in mice. Therefore, the potent inhibition of MATEs by ondansetron enhances the nephrotoxicity associated with cisplatin treatment in mice. Potential nephrotoxic effects of combining the chemotherapeutic cisplatin and the antiemetic 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, should be investigated in patients.",

This /was a/ QTc study of ondansetron conducted in accordance with ICH E14 guidelines, designed to investigate the effect of single intravenous (IV) doses of ondansetron on cardiac conduction compared to placebo and a positive control, moxifloxacin, in healthy subjects. Statistical analysis of dose-response showed the maximum mean difference in QTcF, compared to placebo and corrected for baseline (ddQTcF), was less than 10 milliseconds (ms) after an 8 mg IV dose and approximately 20 ms after the 32 mg dose, each infused over 15 minutes. The concentration-response (Cp-ddQTcF) model resulted in similar predictions for the 8 and 32 mg and was used to predict the maximum mean ddQTcF (upper 90% CI bound) of 9.2 (11.2) ms for 16 mg IV. As a result, single IV doses of ondansetron greater than 16 mg should no longer be used. Adult cancer patients, under 75 years, may receive up to a maximum initial 15-minute IV dose of 16 mg, prior to chemotherapy, followed by 2 additional IV or IM doses of 8 mg for the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).",

The body weight gain of F0 male and female during the premating period, pregnancy, and lactation, mating capacity of F0 animals, and development of F1 and F2 animals were observed. It is proposed that the maximum noneffective dose of ondansetron was 4 and 15 mg/kg with respect to general toxicity and reproductive capacity in F0 animals respectively. The maximum noneffective dose with respect to development in F1 and F2 animals was suggested to be 15 mg/kg.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

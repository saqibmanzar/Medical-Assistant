ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The mechanism of the effect of BHA in inducing cancer in the squamous stomach in rodents suggests that the effect may stem from an increased cell turnover rate caused by the high concentration of the antioxidant. Lower dosages have a much lower, or indeed no effect at 0.25%. Also, discontinuation of compound administration leads to a rapid decline of the effect. During the metabolism of BHA, there may be generations of semiquinone radicals and also hydroxy radicals, which cannot be detoxified on high level intake. Thus clearly BHA and related compounds operate by a dose-related epigenetic action with no effect levels. In a 12 week study in cynomolgous monkeys, gavage of up to 500 mg/kg BHA failed to reveal changes in the stomach and the esophagus, although the latter organ had an increased mitotic index. Liver size increased but little effect was seen on cytochrome p450 and select microsomal enzymes. Thus, the rat forestomach is extraordinarily sensitive to the high level, 2%, of dietary BHA.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.",

The protein has esteratic enzyme activity. The phosphorylation, which was originally studied radiochemically, can be monitored conveniently as progressive inhibition of the activity of this enzyme, which is now referred to as Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE or Neurotoxic Esterase)... . The second, and equally essential, step is the transformation of the phosphorylated NTE to a modified form: one of the remaining ester bonds of the inhibitor molecule attached to the NTE active site undergoes a biochemical cleavage leaving an ionized acidic residue bound to the protein: this residue is negatively charged and the reaction is referred to as \"aging\". Both inhibition and aging of inhibited NTE are essential to initiate neuropathy, but the role of the negative charge in the initiation of axonal degeneration is not known. The process of \"aging\" of inhibited NTE has some analogy with the better-known \"aging\" of inhibited AChE. However, the analogy does not last above the level of enzyme inhibition. Acute toxicity arises directly from the loss of catalytic activity of AChE, leading to accumulation of excess physiological substrate. Mere loss of catalytic activity of NTE (without aging) does not initiate neuropathy. There is no evidence of a deleterious accumulation of a physiological substrate for NTE or lack of hydrolysis products after inhibition in vivo, and the effect of the negative charge may be focused on some quite separate process. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/"

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

Remember that atropine can be administered through an endotracheal tube if initial IV access if difficult to obtain. Depending on the severity of poisoning, doses of atropine ranging from very low to...high... . The objective of atropine antidotal therapy is to antagonize the effects of excessive concentrations of acetylcholine at end-organs having muscarinic receptors. Atropine does not reactivate the cholinesterase enzyme or accelerate disposition of organophosphate. Recrudescence of poisoning may occur if tissue concentrations of organophosphate remain high when the effect of atropine wears off. Atropine is effective against muscarinic manifestations, but it is ineffective against nicotinic actions, specifically muscle weakness and twitching, and respiratory depression. Despite the limitations, atropine is often a life-saving agent in organophosphate poisonings. Favorable response to a test dose of atropine can help differentiate poisoning by anticholinesterase agents from other conditions. However, lack of response, with no evidence of atropinization (atropine refractoriness) is typical of more severe poisonings. The adjunctive use of nebulized atropine has been reported to improve respiratory distress, decrease bronchial secretions, and increase oxygenation. ...Do not administer atropine or pralidoxime prophylactically to workers exposed to organophosphate pesticides. Prophylactic dosage with either atropine or pralidoxime may mask early signs and symptoms of organophosphate poisoning and thus allow the worker to continue exposure and possibly progress to more severe poisoning. Atropine itself may enhance the health hazards of the agricultural work setting: impaired heat loss due to reduced sweating and impaired ability to operate mechanical equipment due to blurred vision. This can be caused by mydriasis, one of the effects of atropine. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

Ampules of...glycopyrolate were added to...saline and this infusion was titrated to the desired effects of dry mucous membranes and heart rate above 60 beats/min. During this study, atropine was used as a bolus for a heart rate less than 60 beats/min. The other apparent advantage to this regimen was a decreased number of respiratory infections. This may represent an alternative when there is a concern for respiratory infection due to excessive and difficult to control secretions, and in the presence of altered level of consciousness where the distinction between atropine toxicity or relapse of organophosphate poisoning is unclear. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

Before administration of pralidoxime, draw a blood sample (heparinized) for cholinesterase analysis (since pralidoxime tends to reverse the cholinesterase depression). Administration pralidoxime (Protopam, 2-PAM), a cholinesterase reactivator, in cases of severe poisoning by organophosphate pesticides in which respiratory depression, muscle weakness, and/or twitching are severe. When administered early (usually less than 48 hours after poisoning) pralidoxime relieves the nicotinic as well as the muscarinic effects of poisoning. Pralidoxime works by reactivating the cholinesterase and also by slowing the \"aging\" process of phosphorylated cholinesterase to a non-reactivatable form. ... Dosage of pralidoxime may be repeated in 1-2 hours, then at 10-12 hour intervals if needed. In very severe poisonings, dosage rates may be doubled. Repeated doses of pralidoxime are usually required. In cases that involve continuing absorption of organophosphate (as after ingestion of large amounts), or continuing transfer of highly lipophilic organophosphate from fat into blood, it may be necessary to continue administration of pralidoxime for several days beyond the 48 hour post-exposure interval usually cited as the limit of its effectiveness. ... Blood pressure should be monitored during administration because of the occasional occurrence of hypertensive crisis. Administration should be slowed or stopped if blood pressure rises to hazardous levels. Be prepared to assist pulmonary ventilation mechanically if respiration is depressed during or after pralidoxime administration. If intravenous injection is not possible, pralidoxime may be given by deep intramuscular injection. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

Physiological variations in blood ChE levels occur in a healthy person and are seen among a population. It has been estimated that the coefficient of variation for AChE activity in samples from an individual is 8-11%, and that a decrease of 23% below pre-exposure level may, therefore, be considered significant. If the average of several pre-exposure values were available, then a decrease of 17% would be significant. It has been recommended that, if measured activity is reduced by 30% or more of the pre-exposure value, AChE measurements should be repeated at appropriate intervals to confirm the results. Depressions of AChE or ChE in excess of 20-25% are considered diagnostic of exposure but not, necessarily, indicative of hazard. Depressions of 30-50% or more are considered indicators for removal of an exposed individual from further contact with pesticides until levels return to normal. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/"

Advances in gas chromatography and combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) have made it possible to analyse the urine of exposed persons for the presence of appropriate metabolites. It is usually necessary to preserve the sample by the addition of chloroform, to concentrate or extract the metabolite(s), and to convert them to suitably-volatile derivatives that can be detected by GC. Obviously, access to a well-equipped analytical laboratory, capable of the quick processing of samples, is a necessary factor if monitoring by urine analysis is proposed. However, in some cases, simpler and sensitive colorimetric tests are available for screening the urine of exposed persons. Thus, 4-nitrophenol can be measured directly in the urine of workers exposed to parathion. Consideration of the concentration of metabolite(s) in the urine can be helpful in determining patterns of exposure, and these concentrations can be calibrated against the effects on AChE for a particular pesticide. However, the time-course and peak of excretion of metabolites appears to vary according to dose, so that serial sampling and analyses of urine are desirable. Levels of metabolite alone cannot be considered a guide to hazard. This is obvious when it is realized that pesticides that have very different toxicities may yield identical acidic metabolites. Thus, the level of metabolites in urine, after exposure to sufficient amounts of the very toxic parathion-methyl to depress blood-AChE to 50%, will be much lower than that of the identical metabolites, following exposure to the related fenitrothion, which is about 40 times less toxic. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/",

Of these 8 persons, one was a worker performing ground application, and the remaining 7 cases were people exposed in a single incident by drift from an air-blast application onto soil. This incident was further investigated by the California Department of Environmental Health, which reported that there were incidents of headache, diarrhea, runny nose, sore throat, burning/itching eyes, fever, and hay fever or asthma attacks. These symptoms were partly attributed to the presence of n-propyl mercaptan, an ethoprop contaminate/degradate with a strong, offensive odor. Note also that the incident resulted from air-blast application to soil, but this type of equipment is no longer listed on ethoprop labels.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.00038 mm Hg at 20-25 \u00b0C indicates ethoprop will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethoprop will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.6 hours. If released to soil, ethoprop is expected to have high mobility based upon Koc values ranging from 70-120. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Ethoprop is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. However, under laboratory conditions, volatilization of ethoprop residue after 12 hours was reported as 1.4-3.6, 2.3-4.5, and 6.5-20.2% from sandy loam soil with 1, 10 and 20 % moisture levels, respectively. Half-lives for photolysis of ethoprop in soil in the sunlight and shade were 4.7 and 12.3 days, respectively. The US Dept of Agriculture's Pesticide Properties Database lists a soil half-life of 25 days for ethoprop, but it may range from 3-56 days. Due to microbial adaptation, ethoprop degrades more rapidly in soils that have had prior exposure to ethoprop. If released into water, ethoprop is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its Koc values. The hydrolytic half-lives of ethoprop in distilled, river, brackish and open sea water were 25, 133, 65, and 81 days, respectively. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. BCF ranging from 4-17 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Ethoprop is very stable in neutral and weakly acidic media, but is rapidly hydrolyzed in alkaline media. Occupational exposure to ethoprop may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethoprop is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ethoprop via ingestion of food and inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Volatilization of ethoprop from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC), given a Henry's Law constant of 1.62X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from ethoprop's vapor pressure, 0.00038 mm Hg(2) and water solubility, 750 mg/l(2). Ethoprop is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(2). However, under laboratory conditions, volatilization of ethoprop residue after 12 hours was reported as 1.4-3.6, 2.3-4.5, and 6.5-20.2% from sandy loam soil with 1, 10 and 20 % moisture levels, respectively(7). The US Department of Agriculture's Pesticide Properties Database lists a soil half-life of 25 days for ethoprop(2), but half-lives may range from 3-56 days(4). Due to microbial adaptation, ethoprop degrades more rapidly in soils that have had prior exposure to ethoprop(5,6). Half-lives for photolysis of ethoprop in soil in the sunlight and shade were 4.7 and 12.3 days, respectively(7).",

According to a classification scheme(5), BCFs ranging from 4-17(6) suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Ethoprop is very stable in neutral and weakly acidic media, but is rapidly hydrolyzed in alkaline media(7). The major degradation pathway for ethoprop under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions is hydrolysis to O-ethyl-S-propyl-phosphorothioic acid(8). The hydrolytic half-lives of ethoprop in distilled, river, brackish and open sea water were 25, 133, 65, and 81 days, respectively(9). Half-lives of 75 and 90 days have been found in sand sediment/water and silt loam sediment/water systems(10).",

Vapor-phase ethoprop is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.6 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.9X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

During 4-week soil incubation studies using 1-ethyl-14C-labeled ethoprop, (14)CO2 evolution ranged from 23.4 to 50.9% in soils having no previous organophosphorus exposure and soils having prior exposure to isofenphos and fonophos(3); (14)CO2 from ethoprop was greater in soil having no prior exposure to the other pesticides(3). Mineralization of ethoprop was found to occur faster in soils that had been treated previously with ethoprop as compared to no prior treatment indicating microbial adaptation(4); during a 1 wk incubation, 32.7% mineralized in previously treated soil and 19.9% mineralized in untreated soil(4). Faster biodegradation in previously ethoprop treated soils was also noted in another study(5); sterilization of soils drastically reduced disappearance rates of ethoprop(5). The soil half-life of ethoprop can range from 3 to 56 days(6). In various field studies, soil half-lives of 2-12 weeks were determined(7). In soil column studies, ethoprop had the following half-lives(8): in silty loam (12 days at 20 \u00b0C to 89 days at 2 \u00b0C), in sandy loam (16 days at 20 \u00b0C to 144 days at 2 \u00b0C), in humous loamy sand (73 days at 20 \u00b0C to 347 days at 6 \u00b0C)(8). The half-lives of ethoprop in sterile and non-sterile soil from a banana plantation in Jamaica, with heavy ethoprop use, were 28.8 and 10.9 days, respectively(9).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5.6 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Ethoprop is very stable in neutral and weakly acidic media, but is rapidly hydrolyzed in alkaline media(2). The hydrolysis half-life of ethoprop in 0.05 N NaOH is 35 min (yielding O-ethyl S-propylphosphorothioc acid)(3); in 0.1 N HCl, very little hydrolysis occurs in 1 hr(3). The major degradation pathway for ethoprop under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions is hydrolysis to O-ethyl-S-propyl-phosphorothioic acid(4). The hydrolytic half-lives of ethoprop in distilled, river, brackish and open sea water were 25, 133, 65, and 81 days, respectively(5). Half-lives for photolysis of ethoprop in soil in the sunlight and shade were 4.7 and 12.3 days, respectively(5).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The US Dept Agric's Pesticide Properties Database lists a Koc value of 70 for ethoprop(2). Koc values of 120.6 and 76.0 have been reported for Riverhead and Rhinebeck soils, respectively(3).

Ethoprop was found in well water samples in 1993 in Chinadega, Nicaragua at a concentration of 9.9 ng/l(2). Ethoprop was not detected (detection limit=0.013 ug/l) in 94 wells of near-surface aquifers in 1992 from 12 Midwestern states of the US(3). Ethoprop was detected in groundwater in 0.1% of the 1034 sites sampled in agricultural and urban settings in 1993-1995 in 20 major hydrologic basins of the US; the detection limit for ethoprop was 0.003 ug/l(4). According to the US Environmental Protection Agency Office of Pesticide Programs Pesticides in Groundwater Database, which compiled monitoring studies for 1971-1991, ethoprop was not detected in 1,368 wells sampled from CA (1987-1989), FL (1985-1986), GA (1984-1991), HI (1986), IA (1983-1989), IN (1983-1989), MO (1987-1990), and OR (1985-1987)(5). Ethoprop was not detected in 37 wells (Jul 1994-Jun 1995) in three counties in California(6).",

Ethoprop was detected in surface water in 2 of 21 samples from the Tortuguero Conservation area, 1 of 44 samples from the Suerte River, and 7 of 97 samples from streams in the Suerte River basin, Costa Rica(3). Ethoprop was in 5% of water samples from Crab Creek at the entrance to Royal Lake in Washington state between Mar 1993-May 1994; the median concentration was <0.003 ug/l (detection limit 0.003 ug/l), and a maximum concentration of 0.12 ug/l reported(4). Twenty-five water samples were collected at least monthly at the mouths of two tributary streams of the South Platte River, CO from Apr 1993-Apr 1994, representing an agricultural and urban area(5). Median and maximum ethoprop concentrations detected at the agricultural area were <0.012 and 0.022 ug/l, respectively; ethoprop was not detected (detection limit=0.012 ug/l) at the urban site(5). Ethoprop was detected in two surface water samples at a maximum concentration of 0.67 ug/l from south Florida from Nov 1991-Jun 1995(6).",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The mice were processed for whole-body autoradiography without thawing or the use of any solvents; sagittal sections of the frozen mice were freeze-dried and placed on x-ray film to reveal areas of localization of radioactivity. The autoradiographs revealed intense localization of radioactivity at 6 min in the epithelium of the nose and bronchi, as well as in the liver, kidney, and salivary glands. There is virtually no affinity of NPIP for melanin. Most of the same localizations persisted from 6 min through 24 hr. At 24 hr, the most intense accumulation was in the epithelium of the bronchi, nose, salivary gland ducts, and esphagus as well as the liver and Harder's gland. Thus, a greater than or equal metabolite of NPIP which localizes in the sites where tumors occur may be similar to a metabolite of N'-nitrosonornicotine. The distribution is consistent with the metabolic conversion of NPIP in the liver and epitherlium of the nose and bronchi with subsequent localization of the metabolite in the epithelium of the esphagus and salivary gland ducts.",

Twenty-five healthy female volunteers consumed a fish meal rich in amines as nitrosatable precursors in combination with intake of nitrate-containing drinking water at the Acceptable Daily Intake level during 7 consecutive days. During 1 week before and after nitrate intake a diet low in nitrate was consumed. Using the same protocol, the effect of two different doses of ascorbic acid (250 mg and 1 g/day) and two different doses of green tea (2 g and 4 g/day) on formation of N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosopiperidine was studied. Mean nitrate excretion in urine significantly increased from control (76+/-24) to 167+/-25 mg/24 h. Intake of nitrate and fish resulted in a significant increase in mean urinary excretion of N-nitrosodimethylamine compared with the control weeks: 871+/-430 and 640+/-277 ng/24 h during days 1-3 and 4-7, respectively, compared with 385+/-196 ng/24 h (p<0.0002). Excretion of N-nitrosopiperidine in urine was not related to nitrate intake and composition of the diet. Intake of 250 mg and 1 g of ascorbic acid per day resulted in a significant decrease in urinary N-nitrosodimethylamine excretion during days 4-7 (p=0.0001), but not during days 1-3. Also, consumption of four cups of green tea per day (2 g) significantly decreased excretion of N-nitrosodimethylamine during days 4-7 (p=0.0035), but not during days 1-3. Surprisingly, consumption of eight cups of green tea per day (4 g) significantly increased N-nitrosodimethylamine excretion during days 4-7 (p=0.0001), again not during days 1-3. This increase is probably a result of catalytic effects of tea polyphenols on nitrosation, or of another, yet unknown, mechanism. These results suggest that intake of ascorbic acid and moderate consumption of green tea can reduce endogenous N-nitrosodimethylamine formation.",

Because it was previously demonstrated that nitrosamines and nitrosamides, representing two classes of NOC, induce distinct gene expression effects in colon cells that are particularly related to oxidative stress, we hypothesized that different radical mechanisms are involved. Using electron spin resonance spectroscopy, we investigated the radical-generating properties of genotoxic NOC concentrations in human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2). Cells were exposed to nitrosamides (N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea) or nitrosamines (N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosopiperidine, and N-nitrosopyrrolidine). Nitrosamines caused formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and carbon-centered radicals, which was further stimulated in the presence of Caco-2 cells. N-methyl-N-nitrosourea exposure resulted in a small ROS signal, and formation of nitrogen-centered radicals (NCRs), also stimulated by Caco-2 cells. N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine did not cause radical formation at genotoxic concentrations, but at increased exposure levels, both ROS and NCR formation was observed. By associating gene expression patterns with ROS formation, several cellular processes responding to nitrosamine exposure were identified, including apoptosis, cell cycle blockage, DNA repair, and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that following NOC exposure in Caco-2 cells, ROS formation plays an important role in deregulation of gene expression patterns that may be relevant for the process of chemical carcinogenesis in the human colon, in addition to the role of DNA alkylation.",

N-nitrosopiperidine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine may be causative agents in human cancer. P450-catalyzed alpha-hydroxylation is the key activation pathway by which these nitrosamines elicit their carcinogenic effects. We hypothesize that the differences in N-nitrosopiperidine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine metabolic activation in the nasal cavity contribute to their differing carcinogenic activities. In this study, the kinetics of tritium-labeled N-nitrosopiperidine or N-nitrosopyrrolidine alpha-hydroxylation mediated by Sprague-Dawley rat nasal olfactory or respiratory microsomes were investigated. To compare alpha-hydroxylation rates of the two nitrosamines, tritiated 2-hydroxytetrahydro-2H-pyran and 2-hydroxy-5-methyltetrahydrofuran, the major N-nitrosopiperidine alpha-hydroxylation products, and tritiated 2-hydroxytetrahydrofuran, the major N-nitrosopyrrolidine alpha-hydroxylation product, were quantitated by HPLC with UV absorbance and radioflow detection. These microsomes catalyzed the alpha-hydroxylation of N-nitrosopiperidine more efficiently than that of N-nitrosopyrrolidine. K(M) values for N-nitrosopiperidine were lower as compared to those for N-nitrosopyrrolidine (13.9-34.7 vs 484-7660 uM). Furthermore, catalytic efficiencies (V(max)/K(M)) of N-nitrosopiperidine were 20-37-fold higher than those of N-nitrosopyrrolidine. Previous studies showed that P450 2A3, present in the rat nose, also exhibited this difference in catalytic efficiency. For both types of nasal microsomes, coumarin (100 uM), a P450 2A inhibitor, inhibited N-nitrosopiperidine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine alpha-hydroxylation from 63.8 to 98.5%. Furthermore, antibodies toward P450 2A6 inhibited nitrosamine alpha-hydroxylation in these microsomes from 68.8 to 78.4% whereas antibodies toward P450 2E1 did not inhibit these reactions. Further immunoinhibition studies suggest some role for P450 2G1 in N-nitrosopiperidine metabolism by olfactory microsomes. In conclusion, olfactory and respiratory microsomes from rat nasal mucosa preferentially activate N-nitrosopiperidine over N-nitrosopyrrolidine with P450 2A3 likely playing a key role. These results are consistent with local metabolic activation of nitrosamines as a contributing factor in their tissue-specific carcinogenicity.",

N-Nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) induces mainly liver tumors in rats and is a weak pulmonary carcinogen in mice. These nitrosamines may be causative agents in human cancer. alpha-Hydroxylation is believed to be the key activation pathway in their carcinogenesis. P450 2As are important enzymes of nitrosamine alpha-hydroxylation. Therefore, a structure-activity relationship study of rat P450 2A3, mouse P450 2A4 and 2A5, and human P450 2A6 and 2A13 was undertaken to compare the catalytic activities of these enzymes for alpha-hydroxylation of (R)-NNN, (S)-NNN, NPIP, and NPYR. Kinetic parameters differed significantly among the P450 2As although their amino acid sequence identities were 83% or greater. For NNN, alpha-hydroxylation can occur at the 2'- or 5'-carbon. P450 2As catalyzed 5'-hydroxylation of (R)- or (S)-NNN with Km values of 0.74-69 microM. All of the P450 2As except P450 2A6 catalyzed (R)-NNN 2'-hydroxylation with Km values of 0.73-66 microM. (S)-NNN 2'-hydroxylation was not observed. Although P450 2A4 and 2A5 differ by only 11 amino acids, they were the least and most efficient catalysts of NNN 5'-hydroxylation, respectively. The catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) for (R)-NNN differed by 170-fold whereas there was a 46-fold difference for (S)-NNN. In general, P450 2As catalyzed (R)- and (S)-NNN 5'-hydroxylation with significantly lower Km and higher kcat/Km values than NPIP or NPYR alpha-hydroxylation (p <0.05). Furthermore, P450 2As were better catalysts of NPIP alpha-hydroxylation than NPYR. P450 2A4, 2A5, 2A6, and 2A13 exhibited significantly lower Km and higher kcat/Km values for NPIP than NPYR alpha-hydroxylation (p <0.05), similar to previous reports with P450 2A3. Taken together, these data indicate that critical P450 2A residues determine the catalytic activities of NNN, NPIP, and NPYR alpha-hydroxylation.",

N-Nitrosopiperidine is a possible causative agent for human esophageal cancer. Our goal is to explain mechanistically these differing carcinogenic activities in the esophagus. We hypothesize that differences in metabolic activation of these nitrosamines could be one factor accounting for their differing carcinogenicity. alpha-Hydroxylation is the key metabolic activation pathway leading to nitrosamine-induced carcinogenesis. In this study, we examined the alpha-hydroxylation rates of [3,4-(3)H]N-nitrosopiperidine and [3,4-(3)H]N-nitrosopyrrolidine by male F344 rat esophageal and liver microsomes. The major alpha-hydroxylation products of N-nitrosopiperidine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine, 2-hydroxytetrahydro-2H-pyran (2-OH-THP) and 2-hydroxytetrahydrofuran (2-OH-THF), respectively, were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography with radioflow detection. N-Nitrosopiperidine or N-nitrosopyrrolidine (4 uM) was incubated with varying concentrations of esophageal microsomes and co-factors. Microsomes converted N-nitrosopiperidine to 2-OH-THP with a 40-fold higher velocity than N-nitrosopyrrolidine to 2-OH-THF. Similar results were observed in studies with N-nitrosopiperidine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine at substrate concentrations between 4 and 100 micro M. Kinetics of N-nitrosopiperidine alpha-hydroxylation were biphasic; K(M) values were 312 +/- 50 and 1600 +/- 312 uM. Expressed cytochrome P450 2A3, found in low levels in rat esophagus, was a good catalyst of N-nitrosopiperidine alpha-hydroxylation (K(M) = 61.6 +/- 20.5 uM), but a poor catalyst of N-nitrosopyrrolidine alpha-hydroxylation (K(m) = 1198 +/- 308 uM). Cytochrome P450 2A3 may play a role in the preferential activation of N-nitrosopiperidine observed in rat esophagus. Liver microsomes metabolized N-nitrosopyrrolidine to 2-OH-THF (V(max)/K(M) = 3.23 pmol/min/mg/ uM) as efficiently as N-nitrosopiperidine to 2-OH-THP (V(max)/K(M) = 3.80-4.61 pmol/min/mg/ uM). We conclude that rat esophageal microsomes activate N-nitrosopiperidine but not N-nitrosopyrrolidine whereas rat liver microsomes activate N-nitrosopiperidine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine. These results are consistent with previous findings that tissue-specific activation of nitrosamines contributes to tissue-specific tumor formation.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

None of the vitamin C (5-50 uM), DADS and DPDS (1-5 uM) concentrations selected induced a significant percentage of apoptosis. In simultaneous treatments, vitamin C, DADS and DPDS reduced the apoptosis induced by NPIP and NDBA in HL-60 and HepG2 cells (around 70% of reduction). We also investigated its scavenging activities towards reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NPIP and NDBA using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate in both cell lines. ROS production induced by both N-nitrosamine was reduced to control levels by vitamin C (5-50 uM) in a dose-dependent manner. However, DADS (5 um) increased ROS levels induced by NPIP and NDBA in HL-60 (40 and 20% increase, respectively) and HepG2 cells (18% increase), whereas DPDS was more efficient scavenger of ROS at the lowest concentration (1 uM) in both HL-60 (52 and 25% reduction, respectively) and HepG2 cells (24% reduction). The data demonstrated that the scavenging ability of vitamin C and DPDS could contribute to inhibition of the NPIP- and NDBA-induced apoptosis. However, more than one mechanism, such as inhibition of phase I and/or induction of phase II enzymes, could be implicated in the protective effect of dietary antioxidants towards NPIP- and NDBA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 and HepG2 cells.",

Phenethyl isothiocyanate and indole-3-carbinol alone showed a weak protective effect towards N-nitrosodibutylamine (0.1 uM, 26-27%, respectively) or N-nitrosopiperidine (1 uM, 26-28%, respectively)-induced oxidative DNA damage. Allyl isothiocyanate alone did not attenuate the genotoxic effect provoked by N-nitrosodibutylamine or N-nitrosopiperidine. In contrast, HepG2 cells simultaneously treated with phenethyl isothiocyanate, indole-3-carbinol and isothiocyanates in combination with vitamin C showed a stronger inhibition of oxidative DNA-damage induced by N-nitrosodibutylamine (0.1 uM, 67%, 42%, 32%, respectively) or N-nitrosopiperidine (1 uM, 50%, 73%, 63%, respectively) than isothiocyanates alone. One feasible mechanism by which isothiocyanates alone or in combination with vitamin C exert their protective effects towards N-nitrosamine-induced oxidative DNA damage could be by the inhibition of their cytochrome P450 dependent bioactivation. Phenethyl isothiocyanate and I3C strongly inhibited the p-nitrophenol hydroxylation (CYP2E1) activity (0.1 uM, 66-50%, respectively), while the coumarin hydroxylase (CYP2A6) activity was slightly reduced (0.1 uM, 25-37%, respectively). However, the ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (CYP1A1) activity was only inhibited by phenethyl isothiocyanate (1 uM, 55%). The results indicate that phenethyl isothiocyanate and indole-3-carbinol alone or phenethyl isothiocyanate, indole-3-carbinol and allyl isothiocyanate in combination with vitamin C protects human-derived cells against the oxidative DNA damaging effects of N-nitrosodibutylamine and N-nitrosopiperidine, two food carcinogenic compounds.",

Samples of 24 hr diet and 12 hr overnight urine were collected from 120 male adults in each of the 2 areas, a high-risk area (Nan'ao County) and a low-risk area (Lufeng County) for esophageal cancer. Annual standardized mortality rates of esophageal cancer in Nan'ao and Lufeng are 110/10(6) and 10/10(6) respectively. The 240 healthy male subjects (35-64 years old) were selected by a 3-stage random cluster sample procedure. Levels of TNOCs, NAAs and volatile nitrosamines in the samples were measured. The TNOC detection rate (95%) in the diet, the TNOC daily intake (4.25 +/- 0.84 umol), TNOC excretion levels (0.04 +/- 0.01 nmol/12 hr) and daily intake of volatile nitrosamines (5.84 +/- 0.71 umol) in the high-risk area were significantly greater than values in the low-risk area (A +/- B = mean +/- SE). The TNOC detection rate in the diet, the TNOC daily intake, TNOC excretion levels and daily intake of volatile nitrosamines in the low-risk area were 70%, 0.25 +/- 0.06 umol, 0.02 +/- 0.01 nmol/12 hr and 3.18 +/- 0.31 umol, respectively. NAA excretion levels showed no difference between the 2 areas (16.3 +/- 7.18 umol/12 hr for Nan'ao and 31.2 +/- 26.4 umol/12 hr for Lufeng).

Our results showed a significant apoptotic cell death (95%) after 24 hr treatment with NDBA (3.5 mM), whereas it was necessary to use high doses of NPIP (45 mM) to obtain a similar percentage of apoptotic cells (86%). In addition, both extrinsic (caspase-8) and intrinsic pathway (caspase-9) could be implicated in the N-Nitrosamines-induced apoptosis. This study also addresses the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as intermediates for apoptosis signaling. A significant increase in ROS levels was observed after NPIP treatment, whereas NDBA did not induce ROS. However, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) did not block NPIP-induced apoptosis. All these findings suggest that NPIP and NDBA induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells via a pathway that involves caspases but not ROS.",

Apoptotic cells were identified by (i) chromatin condensation (ii) flow cytometry analysis and (iii) poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. N-Nitrosopiperidine and N-nitrosodibutylamine induced morphological changes consistent with apoptotic events in HL-60 cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that both N-nitrosamines induced apoptotic cell death in a concentration and time dependent-manner. It was observed that N-nitrosodibutylamine was stronger than N-nitrosopiperidine, since it induced a significant apoptotic cell death after 18 hr starting from a concentration of 2 mm, whereas N-nitrosopiperidine was effective at 10 mm. Furthermore, PARP was markedly cleaved with 0.5 mm of N-nitrosodibutylamine and 5 mm of N-nitrosopiperidine after treatments for 3 and 18 hr, respectively. Finally, the ROS level was found to be elevated after 0.5 hr of treatment with both N-nitrosamines. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) completely inhibited the ROS production induced by N-nitrosopiperidine and N-nitrosodibutylamine. However, this action seems not to be associated with the apoptosis because NAC did not block N-nitrosamines-induced apoptosis. The data demonstrate that N-nitrosopiperidine and N-nitrosodibutylamine induce apoptosis and ROS production in HL-60 cells.",

N-Nitrosamines are formed by the interaction between amines and NOx or nitrites, which are used as additives. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.20X10-2 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates N-nitrosopiperidine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase N-nitrosopiperidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours. N-Nitrosopiperidine has a UV absorption maximum of 337 nm in water; therefore this compound may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, N-nitrosopiperidine is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 170. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.44X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. N-Nitrosopiperidine may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A 33% biodegradation in 30 days suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, N-nitrosopiperidine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Under conditions simulating Southern California midsummer, midday sun, N-nitrosopiperidine exhibited an aqueous photolysis half-life of 12 minutes. Occupational exposure to N-nitrosopiperidine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N-nitrosopiperidine is inadvertently produced. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to N-nitrosopiperidine via ingestion of food and drinking water. Limited data indicate that infants may be exposed to N-nitrosopiperidine via the use of rubber baby bottle nipples and pacifiers. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.44X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 0.36(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Under conditions simulating Southern California midsummer, midday sun, N-nitrosopiperidine exhibited an aqueous photolysis half-life of 12 minutes(7). A 33% biodegradation in 30 days(8) suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). N-Nitrosopiperidine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). N-Nitrosopiperidine has a UV absorption maximum of 337 nm in water(3), and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Under conditions simulating Southern California midsummer, midday sun, N-nitrosopiperidine exhibited an aqueous photolysis half-life of 12 minutes, calculated from a direct photolysis rate of 0.057/minute(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Pacifiers made by 18 manufactures before and after the January 1, 1984 action level of 60 ppb was set by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission were analyzed for volatile N-nitrosamines. N-Nitrosodibutylamine was the principal nitrosamine found, along with trace amounts of N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, and N-nitrosopiperidine. Mean total volatile N-nitrosamine levels for baseline and compliance samples were 63.9 and 21.2 ppb, respectively. The pacifier lots sampled after January 1, 1984 had a significant decrease in contamination levels, indicating that at least 98% of the market share is in compliance with the enforcement policy for N-nitrosamines.",

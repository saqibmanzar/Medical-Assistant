ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 8.61X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C suggests 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene will generally exist as a vapor in the atmosphere. However, monitoring data has identified 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene in atmospheric particulate matter; the particulate matter source may be fly ash from incinerators. Vapor-phase 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.5 days. Particulate-phase 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 1,1'-Methylenebisbenzene has a UV absorption band that extends beyond 290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 9160. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. A 0% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in a 2-week Japanese MITI test(8) suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hours and 8 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. A measured BCF range of 452 to 1190 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound in consumer products containing 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene such as soaps and detergents.

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hours and 8 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 116 days if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), a measured BCF range of 452 to 1190 in catfish(8), suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process in water. 1,1'-Methylenebisbenzene has been shown to biodegrade readily in river die-away tests(9) and in soil inoculum studies following acclimation(10). A 0% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in a 2-week Japanese MITI test(8) suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process(SRC) since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

However, monitoring data indicates that 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene is found on particulate matter in the ambient atmosphere(3); the source of atmospheric particulate matter containing 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene may be fly ash from municipal incinerators(4,5). Vapor-phase 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.5 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(6). Particulate-phase 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene  may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). 1,1'-Methylenebisbenzene has a UV absorption band that extends beyond 290 nm(7), therefore, it may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 1,1'-methylenebisbenzene is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 13 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 8 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 116 days if adsorption is considered(4). 1,1'-Methylenebisbenzene's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur, however, adsorption will attenuate volatilization(SRC). 1,1'-Methylenebisbenzene is used in perfumery and has an odor(5) suggesting evaporation to air can occur(SRC).",

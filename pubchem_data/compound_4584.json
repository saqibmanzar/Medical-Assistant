PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

When the dose of OA was increased from 50-90 ug/kg, the concentrations of the toxin in the intestinal content and feces increased proportionally. A good correlation was found between an increase of OA in the intestinal tissue and the diarrhea in animals given 90 ug/kg orally. Moreover OA was present in liver and bile and in all organs including skin and also fluids. Altogether these results confirmed an enterohepatic circulation of OA as previously shown.",

Total OA was quantified in the whole soft tissues of the individuals collected in days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14. Mortality, dry weight, condition index, gross biochemical composition and gametogenic stages were surveyed. Low variation of glycogen and carbohydrates during the experiments suggest that wedge shells were under non-dramatic stress conditions. Wedge shells fed with non-toxic diets showed similar depuration rates being 15 and 38% higher than in starvation, at 16 and 20 \u00b0C, respectively. Depuration rates under non-toxic diets at 20 \u00b0C were 71% higher than at 16 \u00b0C. These results highlight the influence of water temperature on the depuration rate of total OA accumulated by D. trunculus, even when the increase is of only 4 \u00b0C, as commonly observed in week time scales in the southern Portuguese coastal waters. These results open the possibility of a faster release of OA in harvested wedge shells translocated to depuration systems when under a slight increase of water temperature.",

It is thought that there is no specific target organ for okadaic acid after it has been absorbed into the body. However, the details of its pharmacokinetics are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that okadaic acid was more toxic to the hepatocyte-specific uptake transporter OATP1B1- or OATP1B3-expressing cells than control vector-transfected cells. In addition, PP2A activity, which is a target molecule of okadaic acid, was more potently inhibited by okadaic acid in OATP1B1- or OATP1B3-expressing cells compared with control vector-transfected cells. The cytotoxicity of okadaic acid in OATP1B1- or OATP1B3-expressing cells was attenuated by known substrates of OATP1B1- and OATP1B3, but not in control vector-transfected cells. Furthermore, after uptake inhibition study using OATP1B3-expressing cells, Dixon plot showed that okadaic acid inhibited the uptake of hepatotoxin microcystin-LR, which is a substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, in a competitive manner. These results strongly suggested that okadaic acid is a substrate for OATP1B3 and probably for OATP1B1, and could be involved in unknown caused liver failure and liver cancer. Since okadaic acid possesses cytotoxicity and cell proliferative activity by virtue of its known phosphatase inhibition activity.",

Both rat and the human hepatic cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP) metabolize OA. However, liver cell toxicity of metabolized OA is mainly unclear. The aim of our study was to detect the cellular effects in HepG2 cells exposed to OA in the presence of recombinant CYP enzymes of both rat and human for the investigation of species differences. The results should be set in correlation with a CYP-specific metabolite pattern. Comparative metabolite profiles of OA after incubation in rat and human recombinant CYP enzymes were established by using LC-MS/MS technique. Results demonstrated that metabolism of OA to oxygenated metabolites correlates with detoxification which was mainly catalyzed by human CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Detoxification by rat Cyp3a1 was lower compared to human CYP3A enzymes and activation of OA by Cyp3a2 was observed, coincident with minor overall conversion capacity of OA. By contrast human and rat CYP1A2 seem to activate OA into cytotoxic intermediates. In conclusion, different mechanisms of OA metabolism may occur in the liver. At low OA doses, the human liver is likely well protected against cytotoxic OA, but for high shellfish consumers a potential risk cannot be excluded.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In this study, a monoclonal antibody named 10E8 was screened by cells fusion of Sp2/0 with spleen cells isolated from immunized mouse, and the isotype of McAb 10E8 was belonged to IgG1. The resulted McAb 10E8 displayed higher specificity to OA antigen, with the highest affinity of 2.66x109 L/moL until now. Indirect competitive ELISA (ic-ELISA) indicated that the linear range to detect OA was 20-750 ng/mL. The limit of detection (LOD) was 12 pg/mL, and the recovery average was (84.04+/-5.08)%. The LOD of colloidal gold immunoassay by naked eye and strip reader was 1 ng/mL and 100 pg/mL, respectively, with an average recovery of (88.0275+/-4.4225)%. Therefore, the developed ELISA and colloidal gold immunoassay based on this McAb can be used for OA detection in real samples.",

Immunoassays for the detection of okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysistoxin-1 and dinophysistoxin-2 are developed by immobilising OA on self-assembled monothiols or dithiols in an ordered and oriented way, providing an effective limit of detection of ~1 ng OA equiv./mL seawater. The immunoassays are applied to the analysis of the particulate fraction of seawater samples from two Catalan harbours (NW Mediterranean) and samples collected periodically from the Galician Rias (E Atlantic), as well as a reference mussel sample. Results are in agreement with LC-MS/MS and the certified values. OA concentration in seawater correlates with Dinophysis cell abundance, with a 1-2 weeks lag. The immunoassays provide powerful high-throughput analytical methods potentially applicable as alternative monitoring tools.",

A portable reader was used to generate a qualitative result, indicating the absence or presence of OA-group toxins, at concentrations relevant to the maximum permitted level (MPL). Sample homogenates could be screened in 20 min (including extraction and assay time) for the presence of free toxins (OA, DTX1, DTX2). DTX3 detection could be included with the addition of a hydrolysis procedure. No matrix effects were observed from the species evaluated (mussels, scallops, oysters, and clams). Results from naturally contaminated samples (n = 72) indicated no false compliant results and no false noncompliant results at <50% MPL. Thus, the development of a new low-cost but highly effective tool for monitoring a range of important phycotoxins has been demonstrated.",

FAO is publishing this Food and Nutrition Paper on Marine Biotoxins in an effort to support the exchange of scientific information on an important subject of concern for food safety worldwide. Marine biotoxins represent a significant and expanding threat to human health in many parts of the world. The impact is visible in terms of human poisoning or even death ollowing the consumption of contaminated shellfish or fish, as well as mass killings of fish and shellfish, and the death of marine animals and birds.  This paper provides an extensive review of different aspects of five shellfish poisoning syndromes (paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrheic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning, neurologic shellfish poisoning, azaspiracid shellfish poisoning), as well as one fish poisoning syndrome (ciguatera fish poisoning). Various aspects of these poisoning syndromes are discussed in detail including the causative toxins produced by marine organisms, chemical structures and analytical methods of the toxins, habitat and occurrence of the toxin producing organisms, case studies and existing regulations. Based on this analysis, risk assessments are carried out for each of these different toxins, and recommendations elaborated to better manage these risks in order to reduce the harmful effect of these toxins on public health.[Available from, as of October 9, 2018: http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5486e/y5486e00.htm]",

It is easily accumulated by shellfish, mainly bivalve mollusks and fish, and, subsequently, can be consumed by humans causing alimentary intoxications. OA is used as a biochemical tool as tumor promoter and probe of cellular regulation. HUMAN STUDIES: OA is the main representative diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxin and its ingestion induces gastrointestinal symptoms, although it is not considered lethal. At the molecular level, OA is a specific inhibitor of several types of serine/threonine protein phosphatases. Induction of DNA adducts by OA was shown in human keratinocytes and human bronchial epithelial cells. ANIMAL STUDIES: In mice after 7 days of oral administration of 1 mg/kg/day OA induced diarrhea, body  weight loss, reduced food consumption, and death. OA was a tumor promoter in two-stage experiments on mouse skin. OA can induce disorganization in cytoskeletal architecture and cell-cell contact, cause chromosome loss, apoptosis, DNA damage and inhibit phosphatases, suggesting its potential embryotoxicity. OA is used as a pharmacologically induced model of Alzheimer's disease in different species. In rats intrahippocampal bilateral microinjection of OA led to a spatial memory impairment. A significantly higher frequency of micronuclei was observed in hemocytes from the OA-exposed group of the mussel Perna perna compared to control. Induction of DNA adducts by OA was shown in Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells, also the induction of DNA adducts in zebra fish embryos was demonstrated. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: The blue mussel, Mytilus edulis and the pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas were exposed in vivo to OA and impacts on DNA fragmentation were measured. A significant increase in DNA fragmentation was observed in the two cell types from both species relative to the controls. This increase was greater in the pacific oyster at the higher toxin concentration. In mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis mussel gill cells display higher sensitivity to early OA-mediated genotoxicity than hemocytes. In maize cells, OA caused the cell cycle arrest at preprophase, leading to seedling growth inhibition.",

It mainly inhibits protein-phosphatases, protein synthesis and enhances lipid peroxidation.  Caco-2 cells were treated exclusively by OA (15 ng/mL) or cadmium (Cd) (0.625 and 5 ug/mL) for 24 hr, protein synthesis was inhibited (by 42 +/- 5%, 18 +/- 13%, and 90 +/- 4% respectively) while /malondialdehyde/ (MDA) production was 2,235 +/- 129, 1710 +/- 20, and 11,496 +/-1,624 pmol/mg protein respectively. In addition, each toxicant induced modified bases in DNA; increases in oxidised bases and methylated dC. The combination of OA and cadmium was more cytotoxic and caused more DNA base modifications; the ratio m(5)dC/(m(5)dC + dC) was increased from 3 +/- 0.15 to 9 +/- 0.15 and the ratio 8-(OH)-dG/10(5) dG also (from 36 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 6). The combination of OA and Cd also increased the level of MDA (1,6874 +/- 2,189 pmole/mg protein). The present results strongly suggest that DNA damage resulting from the oxidative stress induced by these two toxicants may significantly contribute to increasing their carcinogenicity via epigenetic processes.",

Accumulation of marine toxins in second order consumers was investigated in the edible parts of a shellfish predator abundant at Aveiro lagoon, the green crab Carcinus maenas. Okadaic acid was found, also in a predominant esterified form. Levels in edible parts (comprising mainly viscera) surpassed 16 ug/100 g. ... One patient may have developed profuse diarrhea after ingestion of a large number of green crabs contaminated with okadaic acid esters. At least 32 ug OA/100 g were found in a remaining sample of its meal. Domoic acid was also found but under the allowable level in force in USA of 30 ug/g crab viscera. In cooked crabs, significant losses of domoic acid were found and it is not suspected to have contributed to the poisoning event, although being a vector for this toxin. The low percentage of free okadaic acid found is in accordance with a predation predominantly on benthonic shellfish (razor clams, clams and common cockle) rather than on rock mussels.",

The objectives of this project were to confirm the outbreak and to identify the etiology, source and mode of transmission.  METHODS: A probable case was defined as an individual with diarrhea (=3 times/day) plus at least one of the following symptoms: fever (=37.5 \u00b0C), vomiting, or abdominal pain after consuming seafood between May 23(rd) and May 28(th), 2011. Using a case-control study design, we compared exposures to suspected seafood items and cooking methods between 61 probable cases and 61 controls.  RESULTS: Over 220 suspected or probable cases of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) were identified (incidence of 18 cases per 100,000). The case control study revealed that 100% of cases and 18% of controls had eaten mussels during the exposure period (OR=infinity, Chi(2)=84.72,P=0.000). The number of mussels consumed was related to DSP risk (P=0.004, Chi2 test for trend). Consumption of other seafood items was not associated with disease. The frequency of diarrhea and vomiting were positively correlated with the number of mussels consumed (r=0.424 and r=0.562, respectively). The frequency of vomiting and the incubation period were significantly correlated with the total time the mussels were boiled (r=0.594 and r=-0.336, respectively). Mussels from 3 food markets and one family contained Okadaic acid (OA) and Dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1).  CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak was attributed to the consumption of mussels contaminated by DSP-toxins (OA and DTX-1) which are produced by different species of dinoflagellates (toxic microalgae) from the genus Dinophysis or Prorocentrum. Suspension of mussel sales and early public announcements were highly effective in controlling the outbreak, although oversight of seafood quality should be a priority to prevent future contamination and outbreaks.",

To test this hypothesis drug-primed mice /were exposed/ to okadaic acid and phosphorylation of Mallory proteins /was measured/. Beginning 15 min after okadaic acid injection, complex changes were progressively seen in the liver cells focally including aggregation of cytokeratins 8 and 18 in hepatocytes. Immunoblots showed a progressive increase in positive staining of the Mallory body band with the antibody to phosphothreonine. NF kappa B activation was progressive up to 2 hr after okadaic acid treatment but was downregulated 7 days later. /The authors/ conclude that hyperphosphorylation and NF kappa B activation may play a role in the early phases of Mallory body formation.",

In order to guarantee consumer protection, the regulatory authorities have defined the maximum level of DSP toxins as 160 ug OA equivalent kg-1 shellfish meat. For risk assessment and overall toxicity determination, knowledge of the relative toxicities of each analogue is required. In absence of enough information from human intoxications, oral toxicity in mice is the most reliable data for establishing Toxicity Equivalence Factors (TEFs).  METHODS: Toxins were administered to mice by gavage, after that the symptomatology and mice mortality was registered over a period of 24 hr. Organ damage data were collected at necropsy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for ultrastructural studies. Toxins in urine, feces and blood were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. The evaluation of in vitro potencies of OA, DTX1 and DTX2 was performed by the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibition assay. RESULTS: Mice that received DSP toxins by gavage showed diarrhea as the main symptom. Those toxins caused similar gastrointestinal alterations as well as intestine ultrastructural changes. However, DSP toxins did not modify tight junctions to trigger diarrhea. They had different toxicokinetics and toxic potency. The lethal dose 50 (LD50) was 487 ug/kg bw for DTX1, 760 ug/kg bw for OA and 2262 ug kg-1 bw for DTX2. Therefore, the oral TEF values are: OA = 1, DTX1 = 1.5 and DTX2 = 0.3. CONCLUSION: ... Results confirmed that DTX1 is more toxic than OA by oral route while DTX2 is less toxic. Hence, the current TEFs based on intraperitoneal toxicity should be modified. Also, the generally accepted toxic mode of action of this group of toxins needs to be reevaluated.",

In this study, dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1) and okadaic acid (OA) were compared for toxicity. The lethality rate increased and the median survival time decreased in a dose-dependent manner in both DTX-1 and OA. The median lethal i.p. dose value was 150.4 ug/kg (95% confidence interval=130.1-171.2 ug/kg) for DTX-1 and 185.6 ug/kg (95% confidence interval=161.2-209.6 ug/kg) for OA. The toxicity equivalent factor 1:1 has been used for OA and DTX-1 in the EU and Japan. Thus, it may be considered that toxicity potential of DTX-1 has remained underestimated as compared to that of OA and DTX-1 might be more toxic than OA.",

The second was daily exposure of shellfish to two different concentrations of OA mixed with the algal feed over 7 days; 1.2 nM OA (~0.05 ug OA/shellfish/day) and 50 nM OA (~2 ug OA/shellfish/day). Hemolymph and hepatopancreas cells were extracted following 1, 3 and 7 days exposure. Cell viability was measured using the trypan blue exclusion assay and remained above 85% for both cell types. DNA fragmentation was examined using the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. A significant increase in DNA fragmentation was observed in the two cell types from both species relative to the controls. This increase was greater in the pacific oyster at the higher toxin concentration. However, there was no difference in the proportion of damage measured between the two cell types, and a classic dose response was not observed, increasing toxin concentration did not correspond to increased DNA fragmentation.",

While its harmful effects have been extensively studied in mammalian cell lines, the impact on marine organisms routinely exposed to OA is still not fully known. Few investigations available on bivalve molluscs suggest less genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of OA at high concentrations during long exposure times. In contrast, no apparent information is available on how sublethal concentrations of OA affect these organisms over short exposure times. In order to fill this gap, this study addressed for the first time in vitro analysis of early genotoxic and cytotoxic effects attributed to OA in two cell types of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Accordingly, hemocytes and gill cells were exposed to low OA concentrations (10, 50, 100, 200, or 500 nM) for short periods of time (1 or 2 hr). The resulting DNA damage, as apoptosis and necrosis, was subsequently quantified using the comet assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Data demonstrated that (1) mussel hemocytes seem to display a resistance mechanism against early genotoxic and cytotoxic OA-induced effects, (2) mussel gill cells display higher sensitivity to early OA-mediated genotoxicity than hemocytes, and (3) mussel gill cells constitute more suitable systems to evaluate the genotoxic effect of low OA concentrations in short exposure studies. Taken together, this investigation provides evidence supporting the more reliable suitability of mussel gill cells compared to hemocytes to evaluate the genotoxic effect of low short-duration exposure to OA.",

The biotoxin Okadaic Acid (OA), a well-known phosphatase inhibitor and tumor promoter, is the primary cause of acute DSP intoxications. Although several studies have described the molecular effects of high OA concentrations on sentinel organisms (e.g., bivalve molluscs), the effect of prolonged exposures to low (sublethal) OA concentrations is still unknown. In order to fill this gap, this work combines Next-Generation sequencing and custom-made microarray technologies to develop an unbiased characterization of the transcriptomic response of mussels during early stages of a DSP bloom.  Mussel specimens were exposed to a HAB episode simulating an early stage DSP bloom (200 cells/L of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima for 24 hr). The unbiased characterization of the transcriptomic responses triggered by OA was carried out using two complementary methods of cDNA library preparation: normalized and Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH). Libraries were sequenced and read datasets were mapped to Gene Ontology and KEGG databases. A custom-made oligonucleotide microarray was developed based on these data, completing the expression analysis of digestive gland and gill tissues.  Findings show that exposure to sublethal concentrations of OA is enough to induce gene expression modifications in the mussel Mytilus. Transcriptomic analyses revealed an increase in proteasomal activity, molecular transport, cell cycle regulation, energy production and immune activity in mussels. Oppositely, a number of transcripts hypothesized to be responsive to OA (notably the Serine/Threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A) failed to show substantial modifications. Both digestive gland and gill tissues responded similarly to OA, although expression modifications were more dramatic in the former, supporting the choice of this tissue for future biomonitoring studies.  Exposure to OA concentrations within legal limits for safe consumption of shellfish is enough to disrupt important cellular processes in mussels, eliciting sharp transcriptional changes as a result. By combining the study of cDNA libraries and a custom-made OA-specific microarray, /this/ work provides a comprehensive characterization of the OA-specific transcriptome, improving the accuracy of the analysis of expresion profiles compared to single-replicated RNA-seq methods. The combination of /this/ data with related studies helps understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying molecular responses to DSP episodes in marine organisms, providing useful information to develop a new generation of tools for the monitoring of OA pollution.",

The genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of OA have been well reported in mammalian experimental animals and in vitro cultured cells. However, there are no available investigations regarding the involvement of the oxidative stress pathways in OA toxicity, especially on aquatic animals such as fish. In this context, ...the present work /aims/ to demonstrate whether OA (7.5 ug/mL) induces oxidative stress and histopathological damages in the fish species Sparus aurata under short term exposure (2 hr, 4 hr and 24 hr). To this end, we have assessed lipid peroxidation and anti-oxidative stress response in liver tissue, and finally ultrastructural changes were investigated in hepatic and gills tissues. Results clearly showed that OA induced significant enhancement in all tested parameters in a time dependent manner and seems to be a strong inducer of oxidative stress in aquatic animals. The data of the present study indicate also that histology is a successful tool to reveal OA impact on liver and gill tissues of Sparus aurata since the animal showed vascular dilation and hepatocellular membrane disintegration in liver and hypertrophy in secondary lamellae and necrotic aspect in the primary lamellae in gill tissue.",

Pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2) and okadaic acid (OA) were detected in offshore surface seawater samples (n = 67) of the Yellow and Bohai Seas, and PTX2 was found in higher concentrations than OA. The concentrations of PTX2 were between 0.49 and 14.14 ng/L. OA, dinophysistoxin-1(DTX1), PTX2 and gymnodimine (GYM) were detected in the nearshore surface seawater samples (n = 20) of the Haizhou Bay of the Yellow Sea. OA concentrations were between 11.47 and 55.85ng/L. There was a large degree of variation in the concentrations of DTX1, from <limit of quantification (LOQ) up to 143.14 ng/L. The nearshore surface seawater samples (n = 13) obtained from the Longdao area of the Bohai Sea mainly contain OA (5.00-24.14 ng/L) and DTX1 (1.52-49.39 ng/L), with PTX2 concentrations being less than the LOQ. Several LMATs were also detected both in the SPM and sediment samples of each study area. In summary, the LMAT composition and concentration levels in the surface seawater found in nearshore samples were substantially different from those of samples from the distant shore, which indicated the obvious regional characteristics of LMATs according to their spatial distribution in the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea.",

To date the amount of toxins ingested from consumption of shellfish has been considered equal to the amount of toxins available for uptake by the human body. The aim of this study is to assess the OA, DTX2 and DTX3 fractions released from raw and steamed mussels and cockles into the digestive fluids (bioaccessibility) using a static in vitro digestion model. Higher bioaccessibility was found in mussels (86%) than in cockles (59%). A significant reduction of ester derivatives of OA and an increase of OA were observed in the bioaccessible fraction of mussel samples, suggesting that DTX3 undergo conversion into their more toxic parent compounds during human digestion. However, similar increase of DTX2 and reduction of the respective acyl derivatives was not observed. Steaming lead to significant reduction of OA and analogues bioaccessibility in both species even though increased concentrations of toxins are obtained after this treatment. Risk assessment based solely on DSP toxins occurrence in seafood can conduct to an overestimation of the exposure and lead to more conservative regulatory measures.",

OA group toxins were detected in mollusk by UPLC-MS/MS with the highest level of 11.3 ng/g and detection frequency of 11.8%. Toxins were detected more frequently in dry season (14.4% of analyzed samples) than in wet season (7.9%). Toxins were also detected more frequently at sampling locations in the northern parts (>/= 10.4%) than in the southern part (>/= 8.3%) of Vietnamese coastline. Results of this study were similar to those obtained in long-term studies in regions geographically close to Vietnam, confirming decisive influence of geographic location on the accumulation of toxins in mollusks. Within the scope of the study, toxin levels in all contaminated samples were below the regulation limit (160 ng/g), but the presence of OA group toxins in bivalve mollusk suggests the need of a more stringent control of toxins in bivalve mollusk in Vietnam.",

Two Dinophysis species, namely, D. caudata and D. acuminata complex, were identified as Okadaic acid (OA)/pectenotoxin (PTX) related species. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis demonstrated that 2.04-14.47 pg PTX2 per cell was the predominant toxin in single-cell isolates of D. caudata. D. acuminata was not subjected to toxin analysis. The occurrence of OAs in phytoplankton concentrates of net-haul sample coincided with the presence of D. accuminata complex, suggesting that this species is most likely an OA producer in this sea area. OA, dinophysistoxins-1 (DTX1), PTX2, PTX2sa, gymnodimine (GYM), homoyessotoxin (homoYTX), and domoic acid (DA) demonstrated positive results in net haul samples. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to report the detection of GYM, DA, and homoYTX in phytoplankton samples in Chinese coastal waters. Among the algal toxins, GYM demonstrated the highest frequency of positive detections in phytoplankton concentrates (13/17). Five compounds of algal toxins, including OA, DTX1, PTX2, PTX2sa, and GYM, were detected in oyster samples. DA and homoYTX were not detected in oysters despite of positive detections for both in the phytoplankton concentrates. However, neither the presence nor absence of DA in oysters can be determined because extraction conditions with 100% methanol used to isolate toxins from oysters (recommended by the EU-Harmonised Standard Operating Procedure, 2015) would likely be unsuitable for this water-soluble toxin. In addition, transformation of DA during the digestion process of oysters may also be involved in the negative detections of this toxin. GYM exhibited the highest frequency of positive results in oysters (14/17). OAs were only detected in the hydrolyzed oyster samples. The detection rates of PTX and PTX2sa in oysters were lower than those in the net haul samples.",

In this study, the temporal and spatial variation of phycotoxins in scallops, phytoplankton, and their cysts were analyzed during a survey conducted from June 2011 to April 2012 around Zhangzi Island. The study area is a semi-enclosed epicontinental sea surrounded by the Shandong Peninsula, the Liaodong Peninsula and the Korean Peninsula. The three main results of the study were as follows: (1) The saxitoxin-group toxins, okadaic acid and analogues, and pectenotoxins were the major phycotoxin residues found in scallops; (2) Six kinds of toxic microalgae were identified, Protoperidinium spp., Gonyaulax spp., and Alexandrium spp. were the dominant taxa; Seven types of potential marine toxin-producing dinoflagellates, A. tamarense, A. catenella, Dinophysis fortii, G. catenatum, Gambierdiscus toxicus, Azadinium poporum, and Pseudo-nitzschia pungen were identified as the primary source of phycotoxins and were present at relatively high density from June to October; and (3) azaspiracids and domoic acid might be new potential sources of toxin pollution. This study represents the first assessment to phycotoxins around Zhangzi Island in the North Yellow Sea.",

These include tetrodotoxin in gastropods in the South of Europe, ciguatoxin in fish in the South of Spain, palytoxin in mussels in the Mediterranean Sea, pinnatoxin all over Europe, and okadaic acid in the south of the U.S. There seem to be new marine toxins appearing in areas that are heavy producers of seafood, and this is a cause of concern as most of these new toxins are not included in current legislation and monitoring programs. Along with the new toxins, new chemical analogues are being reported. The same phenomenom is being recorded in freshwater toxins, such as the wide appearance of cylindrospermopsin and the large worldwide increase of microcystin. The problem that this phenomenon, which may be linked to climate warming, poses for toxicologists is very important not only because there is a lack of chronic studies and an incomplete comprehension of the mechanism driving the production of these toxins but also because the lack of a legal framework for them allows many of these toxins to reach the market. In some cases, it is very difficult to control these toxins because there are not enough standards available, they are not always certified, and there is an insufficient understanding of the toxic equivalency factors of the different analogues in each group. All of these factors have been revealed and grouped through the massive increase in the use of LC-MS as a monitoring tool, legally demanded, creating more toxicological problems.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If vomiting occurs, lean patient forward or place on left side (head-down position, if possible) to maintain an open airway and prevent aspiration. Keep patient quiet and maintain normal body temperature. Obtain medical attention. /Silane, Chlorosilane, and Related Compounds/",

The study design utilized an enhanced version of the protocol in accordance with the OECD and EPA test guidelines Nos. 422 and 870.3650, respectively. Developmental neurotoxicity endpoints including Functional Observational Battery (FOB) and Motor Activity were performed on male and female rats. The test substance was administered six hours a day, seven days a wk by inhalation to 10 rats/sex/group at 0, 200, 1000, and 5000 ppm. All animals survived to the scheduled necropsy. There were no clinical signs or effects on body weights and food consumption among the groups. No treatment-related changes were observed in any FOB or motor activity parameters. There were no alterations in hematology, serum chemistry, organ weights, organ to body weight ratios or macroscopic examination of organs/tissues among the groups. Histopathologic examination of tissues and organs for control and high exposure animals demonstrated no significant microscopic findings. No effects were observed in any of the reproductive parameters evaluated. One female in 200 ppm group was found non-gravid but the remaining females produced litters that were similar in all respects to control litters. Based on the results of this study, the NOAEL for tetramethylsilane in rats via inhalation route was considered to be 5000 ppm.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 718 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tetramethylsilane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tetramethylsilane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 days. Tetramethylsilane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tetramethylsilane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 44. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.25 atm-cu m/mole. Tetramethylsilane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, tetramethylsilane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.7 hours and 3.7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 64 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to tetramethylsilane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is produced or used. The general population is not likely to be exposed to tetramethylsilane as it is predominately used in a research and manufacturing setting. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.7 hours and 3.7 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 64(SRC), from a log Kow of 3.24(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

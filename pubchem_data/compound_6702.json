When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Anthraquinone, 2-aminoanthraquinone, 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone, 2-methyl-1-nitroanthraquinone,1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, 1,4,5,8-tetraaminoanthraquinone, and 1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone (of varying purities) were administered via feed to Fischer 344/N rats and B6C3F, mice. In rats, anthraquinone induced tumors in the liver, kidney, and urinary bladder. A 2-amino substitution narrowed the carcinogenicity to the liver, while multiple amino substitutions led to a carcinogenic response in the urinary bladder alone. A methyl substitution ortho to a 1-aminogroup preserved the hepatic and renal neoplasms seen with the parent anthraquinone, but did not induce urinary bladder tumors; amino or bromo substitutions para to a 1-amino group were related to urinary bladder neoplasms. The intestine may have been a target organ for bromine-substituted anthraquinones. The presence of a nitro group altered the targets of carcinogenicity, and skin tumors may have been associated with this particular functional group in both rats and mice. Over-all for mice, the findings were somewhat different and limited by the small number of common target organs. The parent anthraquinone was clearly carcinogenic only to the liver. There were no other effects of single amino substitutions, in the presence or absence of an additional methyl group, on the carcinogenicity or the site of carcinogenesis of anthraquinone in mice. Multiple amino substitutions diminished, while bromine substitutions enhanced the carcinogenicity induced by anthraquinone and extended the target organs to include forestomach and lung.",

Disperse Blue 7, 2-aminoanthraquinone, 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone, Disperse Blue 3 and Disperse Red 11 were genotoxic (inducing 1814 mutants/10+6 survivors, 369 MN/1000 cells at 13% survival; 397 mutants/10+6 survivors, 196 MN/1000 cells at 21% survival; 178 mutants/10+6 survivors, 119 MN/1000 cells at 51% survival; 264 mutants/10+6 survivors, 109 MN/1000 cells at 15% survival, respectively). Reactive Blue 19 was weakly mutagenic (inducing 144 mutants/10+6 survivors, but only 8 MN/1000 cells at 13% survival). Vat Yellow 4 and Solvent Red 1, with exogenous activation, were also mutagenic (inducing 300 mutants/10+6 survivors, 18 MN/1000 cells at 57% survival, and 100 mutants/10+6 survivors and 16 MN/1000 cells at 22% survival, respectively). With activation 1-nitro-2-methylanthraquinone was judged to give an equivocal mutagenicity response. The maximum test concentration was limited for some compounds by their solubility. Those chemicals that did not induce mutation or cytotoxicity at the limits of solubility were classified separately. Compounds which were not evaluated without exogenous activation because of insolubility but were evaluated with activation include 1-nitro-2-methylanthraquinone, Solvent Red 1 and Vat Yellow 4. Compounds which were not evaluated either with or without S9 activation because of their insolubility in the culture medium include 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, D&C Green, Disperse Blue 1, Disperse Red 60, Vat Blue 4, Vat Blue 20, Vat Brown 1 and Vat Brown 3.",

The high and low time weighted average concn of 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone were 0.20 and 0.10%, respectively, for male and female rats. For mice, two dosage regimens (designated A and B) were used, but the time weighted average concn were the same, 0.06%. A statistically significant positive association between compound administration and mortality was established for the male and female dose A mice. Dose A mice did not survive sufficiently long to be at risk from late developing tumors. Survival in all other groups was adequate. Under the conditions of this bioassay, 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone was carcinogenic in Fischer 344 rats, inducing hepatocellular carcinomas in rats of both sexes, and kidney tumors in male rats. The compound was carcinogenic in female B6C3F1 mice, producing an increased combined incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and neoplastic nodules.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.1X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates, 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.5 hours. Particulate-phase 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 1-Amino-2-methylanthraquinone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 60 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone via dermal contact with consumer products containing this dye. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

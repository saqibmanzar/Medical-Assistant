It is used to control cherry leaf spot, rose mildew, rose black spot, and apple scab. Used on berries, flowers, ornamentals, fruits and vegetables, and for seed- and plant-bed treatment. Also used as a fungicide in paints and plastics, and for treatment of internal and external structural surfaces of buildings. Folpet has low acute toxicity to mammals. It is slighly toxic to birds and bees, and is moderately toxic to fish, aquatic invertebrates, algae and earthworms. Folpet is very irritating to the eyes and repeated or prolonged contact leads to skin sensitization. Chronic exposure tests showed folpet to be carcinogenic in mice (but not rats). On this basis, folpet is considered possibly carcinogenic to humans.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Analysis of radioactivity in tissue and milk samples showed the presence of phthalamic acid and phthalimide. The results of the ruminant metabolism study suggest that folpet is degraded by loss of the one carbon trichloromethyl moiety. This part of the molecule becomes extensively metabolized and the radiolabeled carbon becomes incorporated into thiazolidine and natural products. The remaining phenyl labeled part of the molecule is mostly metabolized to phthalimide and phthalamic acid.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Management depends on: (1) the best estimate of the quantity ingested, (2) time elapsed since ingestion, and (3) the clinical status of the subject. Activated charcoal is probably effective in limiting irritant effects and reducing absorption of most or all of these herbicides. Aluminum hydroxide antacids may be useful in neutralizing the irritant actions of more acidic agents. Sorbitol should be given to induce catharsis if bowel sounds are present and if diarrhea has not already commenced. Dehydration and electrolyte may be severe enough to require oral or intravenous fluids. There are no specific antidotes for poisoning by these herbicides. In the case of suicidal ingestions, particularly, the possibility must always be kept in mind that multiple toxic substances may have been swallowed. If large amounts of herbicide have been ingested and the patient is seen an hour of the ingestion, gastrointestinal decontamination should be considered. If the amount of ingested herbicides was small, if effective emesis has already occurred, or if treatment is delayed, administer activated charcoal and sorbitol mouth. /Herbicides/",

Thirty six pesticide preparations were used in patch tests on 652 patients, 377 of whom were males, at a dermatological clinic in Perugia, Italy. A total of 274 subjects had contact dermatitis on their hands. Ninety two were current and 11 were former agricultural workers. Concn of pesticide used in the tests ranged from 0.05 to 2% and the reactions were read at 48 and 72 hr. Allergic reactions were seen in 46 subjects. These resulted primarily from the fungicides, captan, folpet, and difolatan. The observed allergic reactions in 24 subjects were considered relevant to their contact dermatitis. Sixty six subjects showed irritant reactions. Current and former agricultural workers had a significantly greater sensitivity to pesticides compared to the other patients. It was concluded that sensitivity to pesticides is rather uncommon, and that allergic reactions induced by pesticides are almost always due to fungicides.",

Patch tests with the GIRDCA standard series and a pesticides series revealed positive reactions to carbamate mix, captan, captafol, maneb, and folpet, at 2 and 3 days. The subject said that she had used several pesticides over the year without wearing gloves, although glove use was recommended on the labels of the products.

Groups of three female mice were given diets containing folpet at a concentration of 0, 200 or 5000 ppm (equal to 31 and 845 mg/kg bw) for 24 hr. A fourth group of three females, fed on control diet, also received folpet at a dose of 1430 mg/kg bw by gavage. Body weight, food consumption and clinical signs were measured. After 24 hr, the animals were killed and, after exsanguination, were injected via the tail vein with Evans Blue dye in order to visualize mucosal damage. The gastrointestinal tract was examined macroscopically. Stomach and duodenum were examined micropscopically. Food consumption was reduced by 20-30% in all groups treated with folpet. In the animals treated by gavage, slight erosion and epithelial degeneration of stomach and slight mucosal congestion was observed. In the proximal duodenum, focal areas of moderate epithelial erosion and degeneration were observed. Occasionally, moderate loss of villi and congestion of mucosal vascularity was seen. In the proximal duodenum of animals at 5000ppm, minimal to moderate epithelial erosions and degeneration were observed, but no abnormalities were detected in the stomach. One animal had moderate loss of villi and another mouse had slight mucosal congestion. No marked macroscopic and microscopic effects were observed in animals at 200 ppm",

An additional group fed on control diet that did not contain folpet was given folpet at a dose of 815 mg/kg bw by gavage. After 24 hr, all animals were given control diet for the rest of the study. Animals were checked for clinical signs. Body weight was recorded at days 1, 3 and 7. Food consumption was measured during the first 24 hr of the study. Five animals per group were killed on days 1, 3 and 7. From the control group, 3, 1 and 1 animals were killed on days 1, 3 and 7 respectively. In this study the animals did not receive Evans Blue dye. The gastrointestinal tract of all animals was examined macroscopically. Tissue from the stomach and duodenum obtained from animals killed at 24 hr was examined microscopically. Food consumption on day 1 was markedly reduced (44% of that of control animals) in animals given folpet at a dose of 815 mg/kg bw by gavage. Slight reductions (+/ - 10%) were observed in animals in the groups receiving diets containing folpet at 50, 200 and 5000mg/kg of diet, while food consumption was not reduced at 500 mg/kg. At 815 mg/kg bw, one animal displayed decreased activity and was cold to touch on day 1. No other clinical signs were observed. Necropsy revealed no gross abnormalities in any of the groups at days 1, 3 and 7. Microscopical examination of the stomach and duodenum of the animals killed after one day revealed that two animals in the group at 815 mg/kg bw each had a single minimal erosion in the fundic stomach. No microscopic effects were observed in the stomach and proximal duodenum in mice fed for 24 hr with diets containing folpet at a concentration of 5000 ppm.",

Its use as an agricultural fungicide will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.57X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates folpet will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase folpet will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hours. Particulate-phase folpet will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. The UV spectrum of folpet in hexane shows no absorbance at wavelengths above 300 nm, and therefore folpet is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, folpet is expected to have very high mobility based upon a Koc range of 7.47 to 21.9. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.7X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Folpet may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Soil metabolism studies report degradation half-lives of 2.4-2.5 days under aerobic conditions and <7-15 days under anaerobic conditions, suggesting that folpet biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, folpet is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc range. Biodegradation data in water were not available. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An BCF range of 19 to 81 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Folpet rapidly undergoes chemical hydrolysis in aqueous solution with half-lives of 2.6 hours, 1.1 hours, and 67 seconds at pH 5, 7, and 9, respectively. Occupational exposure to folpet may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where folpet is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to folpet via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of food. (SRC)",

The Environmental Protection Agency calculated an integrated first-order half-life of 2.55 days using non-linear regression on the non-transformed data. An earlier study measured a half-life of 2.4 days with 74% of the applied radioactivity detected as 14CO2 at 7 days post-treatment for the degradation of radiolabeled folpet applied at 5.92 ppm to a sandy loam soil.

Folpet is reported to hydrolyze slowly in water at room temperature and to hydrolyze rapidly at elevated temperature or in alkaline solutions(2). The hydrolysis half-lives are 2.6 hours, 1.1 hours, and 67 seconds at pH 5,7, and 9, respectively(3). The predominant hydrolysis products of folpet are phthalimide, phthalamic acid and phthalic acid(2,3). No photochemically-induced changes in the degradation rate or product distribution were observed in 0.96 ppm solutions of folpet in aqueous pH 3 buffers irradiated with UV light for 8 hours(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In most cases, the levels of folpet present were below the detection limits of the study (1-5 ng/L), but it was detected at levels of 1, 2, and 50 ng/L in three systems. The appearance of folpet in these systems correlated with its seasonal application in these regions(1).",

Folpet was detected in 3 out of 144 samples of imported tomatoes, with a maximum level found of 0.11 ppm(1). In a compilation of monitoring data compiled through the US Food and Drug Administration's Market Basket Studies for the years 1982-1991, folpet was detected in 3 of 234 ready-to-eat food items that were tested. The average levels detected were 10.5 ng/g, 14.0 ng/g, and 225 ng/g in fresh grapes, plums, and strawberries, respectively(2). 109 of 2338 samples of Ontario, Canada-produced fruits and vegetables, collected between 1991 to 1995 contained folpet, at concentrations from <0.01 to >10 ug/g, a 4.7% detection frequency; 4 of the 109 samples where this compound was detected had concentrations of folpet which were sufficient to violate maximum residue limits set by Health Canada(3). Sampling from January 1994 through December 2001 of Sao Paulo, Brazil-produced fruits (1523) and vegetables (700) revealed folpet concentrations from 0.02 to 7.53 mg/kg (mean 0.82 mg/kg); 2 of the 77 samples where this compound was detected had concentrations of folpet which were sufficient to violate maximum residue limits(4).",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

It is possible that a number of biochemical changes may take place in parallel during this period, and some may not be causatively related to the clinical outcome. /It was/ hypothesized that the carbon-mercury bond in methylmercury undergoes homolytic cleavage to release methyl free radicals. The free radicals are expected to initiate a chain of events involving peroxidation of lipid constituents of the neuronal cells. The onset of symptoms is delayed for the period of time that cellular systems are able to prevent or repair effects of lipid peroxidation. When the cellular defense mechanisms are overwhelmed, rapid and progressive degeneration of the tissue results. In the Iraqi poisoning incident, the latent period before toxic signs were noted varied from a matter of weeks to months. In contrast, the latency observed in the Japanese poisoning incident was as long as a year or more. The difference in duration may in part be due to the presence of selenium in the fish ingested by the Japanese population.",

Methylmercury has a half-life in human blood of about 50 days. Organic mercury complexes with free cysteine and the cysteine and sulfhydryl groups on proteins such as haemoglobin. The methylmercuric-cysteinyl complex is recognized by amino acid transporting proteins in the body as methionine, another essential amino acid. Because of this mimicry, it is transported freely throughout the body including across the blood\u2013brain barrier and across the placenta, where it is absorbed by the developing fetus. Also for this reason as well as its strong binding to proteins, methylmercury is not readily eliminated.  Because methylmercury is formed in aquatic systems and because it is not readily eliminated from organisms it is biomagnified. Organic mercury is metabolized into inorganic mercury, which is eventually excreted in the urine and faeces. (6)",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

This interaction initially produces alterations in membrane permeability to calcium ions and inhibition of mitochondrial function. Through unknown signaling mechanisms, mercury subsequently induces the synthesis of glutathione, various glutathione-dependent enzymes, metallothionein, and several stress proteins ... In the kidneys, epithelial cell damage is believed to occur as the result of enhanced free radical formation and lipid peroxidation ... Treatment with mercury results in depletion of cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative damage such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase ... Further, enhancement of glutathione peroxidase has been observed in mercury-treated rats in direct relationship with kidney mercury content ..., but inhibition of renal redox cycle enzymes in vivo did not appear to be a significant determinant of the increased lipid peroxidation observed during HgCl2-induced nephrotoxicity. The selenium-dependent form of glutathione peroxidase is highly sensitive to inhibition by mercury, and it has been proposed that mercury interactions with selenium in the epithelial cells limit the amount of selenium available for this enzyme ... Depletion of mitochondrial glutathione and increases in mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide at the inner mitochondrial membrane ... may contribute to acceleration of the turnover of potassium and magnesium observed at this membrane ... Acute renal failure resulting from mercury exposure has been proposed to result from decreased renal reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the proximal tubules and increased concentrations of these ions at the macula densa ... This increase in ions at the macula densa, in turn, results in the local release of renin, vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole, and filtration failure. These authors based this hypothesis on the observation that saline pretreatment of rats prior to mercuric chloride treatment did not prevent the proximal tubular damage but did prevent the acute renal failure. The saline pretreatment was suggested to have depleted the glomerular renin and thereby prevented the cascade of events occurring after accumulation of sodium and chloride ions at the glomerular macula densa ... A pivotal role for extracellular glutathione and membrane-bound gamma-glutamyltransferase has also been identified in the renal incorporation, toxicity, and excretion of inorganic mercury (HgCl2) in rats ...",

The current does not appear to be mediated by either the sodium or calcium channels, but it may be activated by increases in intracellular calcium. Such slow inward currents suppress voltage- and neurotransmitter-activated currents. Studies of the effects of inorganic mercury, methylmercury, and phenylmercuric acetate on synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal slices ... revealed that the mechanisms that underlie the effects of various mercurials on central synaptic transmission differ with respect to the sites of action, the potency, and the reversibility of the effect. Inorganic mercury (Hg++) appeared to act primarily on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane, whereas the action of methylmercury and phenylmercuric acetate was at both the pre- and postsynaptic sites but primarily on the postsynaptic membranes. /It was/ suggested that these differences may result, in part, from the differences in lipophilicity among the different mercurials studied.",

The potent inhibitory effects of methylmercury on microtubule assembly at ratios stoichiometric with the tubulin dimer /have been demonstrated/. The effects were thought to be mediated through MeHg binding to free sulfhydryl groups on both ends and on the surface of microtubules, which would provide multiple classes of binding sites for MeHg. In subsequent in vitro studies, ... a single high affinity class of binding sites /was identified/ on tubulin for methylmercury with 15 sites ... MeHg binds to tubulin stoichiometrically within microtubules and does not induce microtubule disassembly at this low binding ratio. Free subunits of tubulin, however, will act as uncompetitive inhibitors for MeHg binding to the polymer, and MeHg binding to the multiple sites in the free dimer blocks subsequent assembly. In contrast, the stoichiometric polymer surface binding sites for MeHg in microtubules apparently do not interfere with subsequent polymerization. Mitotic inhibition from damage to microtubulin and binding to tubulin has also been reported ...",

In /an/ in vivo study ..., it was concluded that methylmercury may be acting on mitotic spindle microtubules leading to cell injury in the developing cerebellar cortex. Cell injury observed in the external granular layer of the cerebellar cortex of 2-day-old rats was attributed to a reduced percentage of late mitotic figures (arrested cell division) due to the loss of spindle microtubules. Mitosis and migration of granule cells in the cerebellum end within weeks following birth; therefore, this observation may suggest potential differences in the sensitivities of children and adults to mercury-induced neurotoxicity. The toxic effects of methylmercury on the developing nervous system may also be due to deranged neuronal cell migration ... Examination of the brains of two infants who died following in utero exposure to methylmercury revealed an abnormal pattern in the organization and a distorted alignment of neurons in the cerebral cortex. Exposures first occurred during the critical period of neuronal migration (from gestation week 7 into the third trimester) in the fetus. Both could result from a direct effect of mercury on microtubule proteins. Cell division and cell migration both require intact microtubules for normal functioning and, therefore, have been suggested as primary targets for methylmercury disruption in the developing nervous system. It is hypothesized .. that the uptake of methylmercury through the blood-brain barrier in developing and mature animals is closely linked to amino acid transport and metabolism because of the infusion of L-cysteine enhanced (203)Hg uptake. The enhanced transport in the fetus may be a result of the immaturity of the transport systems in the blood-brain barrier or of possible physical immaturity of the barrier itself. Methylmercury has also been shown to increase intracellular Ca++ and inositol phosphate levels ... The observed stimulation of protein phosphorylation in rat cerebral neuronal culture was believed to be the result of elevation of intracellular second messengers (Ca++, inositol phosphate) rather than to a direct interaction between methylmercury and protein kinase enzymes. This observation was considered to suggest a specific interference with neuronal signal transduction.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Over time the source of the poisoning was traced to consumption of contaminated fish and seafood from Minamata Bay. An industrial plant was found to have discharged waste containing mercury directly into the waters of the bay. The initial cases of what was later called Minamata disease were two young women with what appeared to be encephalitis. Public awareness of the situation grew after the sudden deaths of cats in the surrounding area. Cats were brought into Minamata in February 1957 to study the possible health impact of environmental exposure to methylmercury. Within 32 to 65 days after arrival, all developed similar symptoms (e.g., excessive salivation, violent rotational movements, inability to walk in a straight line, and collapsing death or voluntarily jumping into the sea to drown) ... This episode revealed the potential neurotoxic effects on humans exposed to methylmercury. Officially, approximately 2,200 persons have Minamata disease. Many other cases of the disease have either not been reported or were misdiagnosed. Many had eaten contaminated fish and shellfish for quite some time before the symptoms appeared ... In human patients, the early stage of Minamata disease brought gross disturbance of the central nervous system, which affected approximately 88 people living in the area around Minamata Bay. Of those 88 people, 12 died within 100 days, while the others had permanent disability. Among those with permanent disability, symptoms included appallic symptoms and idiotic disorders, with nervous symptoms resulting from widespread disturbance of brain cortices. In those with advanced illnesses from moderate poisoning, symptoms included tremor, disturbance of sensation, severe generalized ataxia, dysarthria, concentric constriction of the visual fields, and difficultly in hearing. The most common clinical signs observed in adults were paresthesia, ataxia, sensory disturbances, tremors, impairment of hearing, and difficulty in walking. Examination of the brains of severely affected patients who died revealed marked atrophy of the brain (55% normal volume and weight), with lesions in the cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex, and changes in the nerve fibers, cystic cavities, and spongy foci ... Microscopically, entire regions of the brain were devoid of neurons, granular cells in the cerebellum, Golgi cells, and Purkinje cells. In addition to effects on the brain, methylmercury is known to have direct effects on the visual field ... Results /were presented/ from a study on the comparison of magnetic resonance imaging findings of the striate cortex with visual field deficits in patients with Minamata disease. Results from this study indicated that the central 10 deg and 15 deg of vision represent 20% and 30% of the surface area of the striate cortex, respectively. The central portion of the visual fields occupied the posterior area as well as a greater proportion of the striate cortex. The visual field deficits in patients with Minamata disease correlated well with the magnetic resonance findings of the striate cortex. In severe cases of Minamata disease, the visual fields are identical with bilateral homonymous hemianopsia, with sparing of central vision",

Methylmercury, a residual product from acetaldehyde synthesis, was released from a manure factory located 70 km up the river. Untreated wastewater from the factory drained into the Agano River, contaminating the fish and shellfish population. By 1973, 325 patients with Minamata disease were identified. This poisoning was later named \"Niigata Minamata disease.\" Similar to the incident in Minamata, the symptoms progressed even after cessation of exposure. Numbness in the extremities and in the perioral area was the most frequently reported ... In the Niigata incident, the maternal hair mercury concentration immediately after giving birth to a congenital patient was 293 ppm. The maternal symptoms associated with this level of exposure were mild, with sensory disturbances and other Minamata disease-related symptoms. The level of mercury exposure required to initiate the onset of Minamata disease was established at 50 ppm maternal mercury hair level. Because of the previous experience in Minamata with methylmercury poisoning, women with hair mercury levels above 50 ppm were advised not to become pregnant. As a consequence, there was only one case of congenital Minamata disease in the Niigata incident",

Because the grain was delivered at planting time, residents of the area baked the grain into bread. There are no records on the size of the population who consumed grain treated with methylmercury fungicide. Nor are there reliable estimates of the number of people who ate methylmercury-treated grain and developed signs and symptoms but did not seek medical attention. It was not until late December 1971 that the first case of methylmercury poisoning was recorded. Within 2 months, 6,530 hospital admissions and 459 hospital deaths were recorded from methylmercury ingestion. Included in this exposed population were pregnant women ... Children exposed in utero manifested severe sensory impairments such as blindness and deafness, general paralysis, hyperactive reflexes, cerebral palsy, and impaired mental development.",

Some of the most sensitive responses seen in fishes are reminiscent of the symptoms experienced by the Minamata victims. This article reviews the literature, with a focus on mercury's effects on fish reproduction (hormone levels, gametogenesis, fertilization success), embryonic development (morphological abnormalities, rate), the development of behavior, and neurobehavioral effects in adults. ... There have been many studies demonstrating delayed effects of mercury exposure in that exposures during one life history stage can produce effects much later during different life history stages. For example, exposure of maturing gametes can result in abnormal embryos, even though the embryos were not themselves exposed to the toxicant. Exposures during sensitive embryonic periods can produce long-lasting effects that can be seen in adult stages. The existence of these manifold delayed effects renders the practice of short-term toxicity testing particularly unhelpful for understanding the effects of this (and other) toxicants.[Weis JS; J Environ Sci Health; Part C.

However, air and water, depending upon the level of contamination, can contribute significantly to the daily intake of total mercury. ... Fish and fish products are the dominant source of methylmercury in the diet ... Methylmercury in the human diet is almost completely absorbed into the bloodstream and distributed to all tissues within about 4 days. ... Methylmercury is converted to inorganic mercury in experimental animals and humans. ... The rate of excretion of mercury in both laboratory animals and humans is directly proportional to the simultaneous body burden and can be described by a single-compartment model with a biological half-time, in fish-eating humans, of 39-70 days ... In every animal species studied, the nervous system is a target of methylmercury, fetuses appearing to be at higher risk than adults. ... Methylmercury is fetotoxic in mice (single dose of 2.5-7.5 mg/kg); teratogenic in rats, and adversely affects the behavior of monkey offspring (mercury doses of 50-70 ug/kg per day before and during pregnancy). It also affects spermatogenesis in mice .... The clinical and epidemiological evidence indicates that prenatal life is more sensitive to the toxic effects of methylmercury than in adult life. The inhibition of protein synthesis is one of the earliest detectable biochemical effects in the adult brain ... Methylmercury can also react directly with important receptors in the nervous system, as shown by its effect on acetylcholine receptors in the peripheral nerves. In the case of prenatal exposure ... it affects normal neuronal development, leading to altered brain architecture, heterotopic cells and decreased brain size. Methylmercury may also be exerting an effect, perhaps through inhibition of the microtubular system, on cell division during critical stages in the formation of the central nervous system. ... No adverse effects /in adults/ have been detected with long-term daily methylmercury intakes of 3-7 ug/kg body weight (hair mercury concentrations of approximately 50-125 ug/g). Pregnant women may suffer effects at lower methylmercury exposure levels than non-pregnant adults, suggesting a greater risk for pregnant women. Severe derangement of the developing central nervous system can be caused by prenatal exposure to methylmercury. ... Evidence of pyschomotor retardation (delayed achievement of developmental milestones, a history of seizures, abnormal reflexes) was seen ... at maternal hair levels below those associated with severe effects. ... CONCLUSIONS: ... Certain groups with a high fish consumption may attain a blood methylmercury level ... associated with a low (5%) risk of neurological damage to adults. The fetus is at particular risk. ... There is a need for epidemiological studies on children exposed in utero to levels of methylmercury that result in peak maternal hair mercury levels below 20 ug/g, in order to screen for those effects only detectable by available psychological and behavioral tests.",

Methylmercury alters calcium ion concentrations by at least two mechanisms. First, it disrupts regulation of Ca2+ from an intracellular Ca2+ pool and second, it increases the permeability of the plasma membrane to Ca2+. Methylmercury also blocks plasma membrane voltage-dependent Ca2+ and Na+ channels in addition to activating a nonspecific transmembrane cation conductance. Chronic Methylmercury exposure results in ultrastructural changes and accumulation of Methylmercury within mitochondria. In vitro, Methylmercury inhibits several mitochondrial enzymes and depolarizes the mitochondria membrane subsequently reducing ATP production and Ca2+ buffering capacity. Inhibition of protein synthesis is observed after in vivo or in vitro exposures of Methylmercury and may be an early effect of Methylmercury poisoning. Organic mercury exerts developmental effects by binding to tubulin, preventing microtubule assembly and causing mitotic inhibition (A15097)",

BASIS FOR CLASSIFICATION: Based on inadequate data in humans and limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. Male ICR and B6C3F1 mice exposed to methylmercuric chloride in the diet had an increased incidence of renal adenomas, adenocarcinomas and carcinomas. The tumors were observed at a single site and in a single species and single sex. The renal epithelial cell hyperplasia and tumors were observed only in the presence of profound nephrotoxicity and were suggested to be a consequence of reparative changes in the cells. Several nonpositive cancer bioasays were also reported. Although genotoxicity test data suggest that methylmercury is capable of producing chromosomal and nuclear damage, there are also nonpositive genotoxicity data.

(1) \nAcute Exposure: Symptoms of ingestion within the first few minutes may include pain, profuse vomiting and severe purging and the victim may die within a few hours from peripheral vascular collapse secondary to fluid and electrolyte loss. Primary gastroenteritis may subside spontaneously within a few days but severe hemorrhagic inflammation of the colon (colitis) has occurred as late as 9 days following ingestion. A second phase developing over 1-3 days is characterized by stomatitis (lesions of the mouth parts), membranous colitis and kidney damage (tubular nephritis). This second phase is associated with a slow and prolonged excretion of mercury by salivary glands, the gastrointestinal mucosa and kidneys. Death in this phase usually occurs as a result of kidney failure.\n",

Increased uptake by brain was also achieved by administration of a cysteine-supplemented diet ... The stimulatory effect of L-cysteine may be due to the structural similarity between the methylmercury-cysteine complex and L-methionine, which permits use of the same L-amino acid transport system ...

Depletion of hepatic GSH by 1,2-dichlorobenzene resulted in a reduced blood GSH concentration and a reduced renal content of methylmercury. Inhibition of renal gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, a membrane enzyme that  catalyzes the breakdown of GSH, decreased the renal deposition and increased the urinary excretion of methylmercury. The sex difference in the renal handling of methylmercury in some mouse strains may also depend on the concentration and metabolism of renal GSH ...",

The authors conducted a psychophysical study of tactile sensation to evaluate the somatosensory abilities of subjects living in a methylmercury-polluted area around Minamata City, Japan. The authors examined control subjects and methylmercury-exposed subjects with and without numbness. A history of methylmercury exposure was taken and a neurological examination performed. Aluminum-oxide abrasive papers were used as stimuli in a psychophysical sensory examination of fine-surface-texture discrimination. Difference thresholds from 3 um were calculated by the two-alternative, forced-choice technique. Difference thresholds in control subjects were also calculated for comparison. The difference threshold was 6.3 um in exposed subjects with sensory symptoms, 4.9 um in exposed subjects without sensory symptoms, and 2.7 um in control subjects. Acuity of fine-surface-texture discrimination was disturbed not only in subjects with clinical complaints of hand numbness, but also in subjects without hand numbness who lived in the district where methylmercury exposure occurred...",

Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is primarily related to changes in the probability of neurotransmitter release. To determine if MeHg affects STP development, .. STP forms in the visual cortex of rat /were examined/ following in vivo MeHg exposure. Neonatal /male Sprague-Dawley/ rats received 0 (0.9% NaCl), 0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg/day MeHg subcutaneously for 15 or 30 days beginning on postnatal day 5, after which visual cortical slices were prepared for field potential recordings. In slices prepared from rats treated with vehicle, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by paired-pulse stimulation at 20-200 ms inter-stimulus intervals showed a depression (PPD) of the second fEPSP (fEPSP2). PPD was also seen in slices prepared from rats after 15 day treatment with 0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg/day MeHg. However, longer duration treatment (30 days) with either dose of MeHg resulted in paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of fEPSP2 in the majority of slices examined. PPF remained observable in slices prepared from animals in which MeHg exposure had been terminated for 30 days after completion of the initial 30 day MeHg treatment, whereas slices from control animals still showed PPD. MeHg did not cause any frequency- or region-preferential effect on STP. Manipulations of [Ca2+](e) or application of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline could alter the strength and polarity of MeHg-induced changes in STP.",

In the present study, groups of wild-caught, prefledgling white ibises (Eudocimus albus) were raised in a free-flight, open-air aviary on diets that approximated the measured range of methylmercury exposure in the Everglades ecosystem (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg/day). The effect of methylmercury exposure on group foraging efficiency was examined by allowing birds to forage on 200 fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) in artificial ponds for 15 min by straining the arenas' contents through a seine net and counting all remaining prey. Additionally, we varied the difficulty of foraging by these tactile feeding birds by adding multiple levels of structural complexity (e.g., increased vegetation and prey refugia) to the pond. Structural complexity affected both foraging efficiency and the rate of increase in efficiency over time (improvement). Methylmercury exposure affected foraging efficiency (p = 0.03). It did not affect foraging improvement in the face of increasingly challenging environments, however, and the dose-response relationship was nonlinear (e.g., the control and high-exposure groups were the least efficient foragers). Evidence for an effect of methylmercury on foraging efficiency therefore was inconclusive because of unpredicted results and no interaction with time or habitat complexity. These data suggest a nonlinear dose-response relationship at low levels of methylmercury exposure ... This appears to be the first experimental demonstration of the effects of habitat complexity on foraging efficiency in long-legged wading birds.",

In an effort to understand the potential causal relationship between MeHg exposure and endocrine development, we established four dietary exposure groups (0 [control], 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg wet wt/day of MeHg) of postfledging white ibises (Eudocimus albus) in a divided, free-flight aviary that spanned the estimated range of environmental exposure for this species. Fecal samples were collected from individually identified ibises over six months in 2005 and processed for hormone evaluation. Significant sex-related differences in fecal estradiol concentrations, though unpredicted in direction, suggest that this steroid could be related to juvenile development in this species. Using repeated-measures general linear models, we tested a set of candidate models to explain variation in endocrine expression. We found that MeHg exposure led to significant differences in fecal estradiol concentrations between the control and medium-dose groups, whereas differences in fecal corticosterone concentrations were observed between the control and both the low- and high-dose groups. These results suggest highly nonlinear dose-response patterns for MeHg. Many endocrine-disrupting contaminants are theorized to affect multiple endpoints in a nonlinear manner, making results difficult to interpret using a traditional toxicological approach.",

Methylmercury /was injected/ into the air cells of eggs of 26 species of birds and ... the dose-response curves of embryo survival /were examined/. For 23 species /there was/ adequate data to calculate the median lethal concentration (LC(50)). Based on the dose-response curves and LC(50)s, ... species /were ranked/ according to their sensitivity to injected methylmercury. Although the previously published embryotoxic threshold of mercury in game farm mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) has been used as a default value to protect wild species of birds, ... relative to other species, mallard embryos are not very sensitive to injected methylmercury; their LC(50 )was 1.79 ug/g mercury on a wet-weight basis. Other species ... also exhibiting relatively low sensitivity to injected methylmercury (LC(50)s of 1 ug/g mercury or higher) were the hooded merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus), lesser scaup (Aythya affinis), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), and laughing gull (Larus atricilla). Species categorized as having medium sensitivity (LC(50)s greater than 0.25 ug/g mercury but less than 1 ug/g mercury) were the clapper rail (Rallus longirostris), sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), chicken (Gallus gallus), common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), herring gull (Larus argentatus), common tern (Sterna hirundo), royal tern (Sterna maxima), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), great egret (Ardea alba), brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis), and anhinga (Anhinga anhinga). Species categorized as exhibiting high sensitivity (LC(50)s less than 0.25 ug/g mercury) were the American kestrel (Falco sparverius), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), white ibis (Eudocimus albus), snowy egret (Egretta thula), and tri-colored heron (Egretta tricolor). ...  The dose-response curves and LC(50)s derived from the egg injections are useful for ranking the sensitivities of various species but are not identical to the LC(50)s that would be observed if the mother bird had put the same concentrations of mercury into her eggs; the LC(50)s of maternally deposited methylmercury would be higher.",

Groups of wild-caught, prefledgling white ibises (Eudocimus albus) were raised in a free-flight, open-air aviary on diets that approximated the measured range of methylmercury exposure in the Everglades ecosystem (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg/d). The effect of methylmercury exposure on group foraging efficiency was examined by allowing birds to forage on 200 fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) in artificial ponds for 15 min by straining the arenas' contents through a seine net and counting all remaining prey. Additionally, ... difficulty of foraging by these tactile feeding birds /was varied/ by adding multiple levels of structural complexity (e.g., increased vegetation and prey refugia) to the pond. Structural complexity affected both foraging efficiency and the rate of increase in efficiency over time (improvement). Methylmercury exposure affected foraging efficiency (p = 0.03). It did not affect foraging improvement in the face of increasingly challenging environments, however, and the dose-response relationship was nonlinear (e.g., the control and high-exposure groups were the least efficient foragers). Evidence for an effect of methylmercury on foraging efficiency therefore was inconclusive...",

Methylmercury ion is also formed in the environment from bacterial action on the metal which enters the environment via spills and effluent. Potential sources of mercury which may result in methylmercury formation are from release of inorganic mercury to the environment from disposal of municipal wastes in sanitary landfills and subsequent leaching from these sites, emissions from refuse incineration, non-ferrous metal production, iron and steel production, fossil fuel combustion, chlor-alkali industries, and atmospheric fallout. Its former production and use as a fungicide treatment for grains resulted in its direct release to the environment. Methylmercury ion arises largely, if not solely, from the methylation of inorganic mercury. Major non-commercial sources of which are degassing of the earth's crust, emissions from volcanoes, and evaporation from natural bodies of water. If released to the atmosphere, wet and dry deposition would probably be important fate processes. Methylmercury is part of the biogeochemical cycle of mercury. Where mercury is found in soil, methylmercury may also be found since it is both produced and destroyed by microbial processes involving mercury compounds. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected because methylmercury exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. In water, methylmercury is both produced and destroyed by microbial activity. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon its cationic state. Methylmercury ion is soluble at low concentrations. Methylmercury is rapidly taken up by fish and other organisms either directly through water or through the food chain, and accumulated in their tissues where it is retained for relatively long periods of time (depuration half-life 1-3 years). Rates of methylmercury production and bioaccumulation depend not only on the abundance of inorganic mercury but also on a complex assortment of environmental variables which affect the activities and species composition of the microflora and the availability of the inorganic mercury for methylation. Methylmercury ion can react with free S-H groups of biologically important molecules, leading to diseases that have been caused by mercury and its derivatives. Consumption of fish and shellfish is the main source of methylmercury exposure in the general population. (SRC)",

Methylmercury can be produced in bottom sediments, rotten fish and soil from inorganic mercury by biological activity(1,2). Experimental flooding of a 16 ha boreal forest wetland located in the Experimental Lakes Area, northwest Ontario, Canada resulted in increased levels of methylmercury ion in the water (exceeding 2 ng/L), brought about by an increase in microbial methylation of inorganic mercury activity(3). Prior to flooding, avg methylmercury concn was 0.1 ng/L; after flooding - 0.9 ng/L(3). During the winter and following the fall drawdown, the pond became completely anoxic and methylmercury levels were at 2.8 ng/L(3). The avg % of total mercury that was methylmercury increased from 4% to 32% after flooding(3). Concn of methylmercury in sediments, water and fish is probably influenced by several factors such as mercury concn, microbial activity, organic matter, presence of methyl group donors, pH, Eh, and O2(5,6). Sulfate, manganese, and iron concns influence methylation/demethylation as well(5). Mercuric ion is the most suitable form for methylation; therefore, mercury methylation may be limited by the rate of Hg(0) oxidation(6). Using estuarine sediments from Cheesaquake State Park, NJ (pH = 6.8), methylation of mercury to monomethylmercury was enhanced under anaerobic, low salinity conditions; aerobic, high-salinity environments were less conducive to monomethylmercury synthesis(7).",

Potential sources of methylmercury are from release of inorganic mercury to the environment from: disposal of municipal wastes in sanitary landfills and subsequent leaching from these sites(1,2), emissions from refuse incineration, non-ferrous metal production, iron and steel production, fossil fuel combustion, chlor-alkali industries, and atmospheric fallout(2). Methylmercury ion is also formed in the environment from bacterial action on the metal which enters the aquatic environment via activities resulting from gold mining(4). Methylmercury's former production and use as a fungicide-treatment for grains resulted in its direct release to the environment(5).",

Free Hg++ is gradually released from this pool of slightly soluble inorganic mercury and is then transformed by microbial activity into methylmercury ion. Methylmercury ion diffuses into the water column and is taken up by fish and other organisms (either directly through water or through the food chain), and accumulated in their tissue. Rates of methylmercury ion production and bioaccumulation depend not only on the abundance of inorganic mercury but also on a complex assortment of environmental variables which affect the activities and species composition of the microflora and the availability of inorganic mercury for methylation. Stimulation of microbial growth by nutrients such as readily metabolized organic matter tends to promote methylation of the available (free bivalent) fraction of the inorganic mercury, although this tendency is counteracted to a greater or lesser extent by other microbial processes such as microbial breakdown (demethylation) of methylmercury ion and the formation of sulfides. The effects of environmental variables are complex and mercury transformation processes are highly dependent upon the characteristics of the system(1). Methylmercury ion, added to a river water system containing sediment, was sorbed onto the sediments reaching a maximum in 7 days. At first no conversion of methylmercury ion occurred, but after 7 days 35% inorganic mercury was produced and in 28 days 55% was produced(2).",

Bioaccumulation occurs because mercury, when methylated, enters the food chain by rapid diffusion and tight binding to proteins in aquatic biota(2).

However, living but non-growing bacterial and algal cells cause the demethylation of methylmercury to inorganic mercury, and dead bacterial cells can lead to the methylation of inorganic mercury to methylmercury(1). Temperature, organic enrichment, and oxygen level also influence methylation activity. Low temperature has been found to limit methylation in sediment, although methylmercury production has been observed in river sediments at 4 \u00b0C. Methylation activity is stimulated by the addition of organics and directly correlates with the organic content of the environment. Reports of the effects of oxygen level on mercury methylation are conflicting although most investigators have observed higher methylation rates in anaerobic sediments than in aerobic sediments(2,3). Mercury freshly added and bound to river sediment was found to be available for methylation by microorganisms. Thus, adsorption of inorganic mercury compounds may not render it biologically inactive(2). The following methylation rates were observed: anaerobic sediments with 0.1-50 mg/L Hg added, 0-1.9 ug Hg/day-volatile suspended solids; anaerobic sediments with 10-100 ug/g added, 1.9-9.7 ug Hg/day-volatile suspended solids; aerobic sediments with 10-100 ug/g added, 0-5.2 ug Hg/day-volatile suspended solids(3).",

It is kinetically inert and not amenable to decomposition so once formed, methylmercury ion is not readily demethylated(1). The neutral methylmercury ion species are soluble at the low concentrations at which they are formed, and thus escape into the water by diffusion and is dispersed by turbulence and convective circulation(1). Methylmercury may be transformed into other organic and inorganic mercury compounds by microbial processes and possibly some chemical processes(2-4). Net methylmercury production depends on the balance between methylation and demethylation which is influenced in a complex and variable manner of biological and physicochemical processes such as pH, temperature, dissolved organic carbon, oxygen concentration, mercury and methylmercury concentration and availability(1). Sulfate, manganese, and iron concentrations influence methylation/demethylation as well(1). Methlmercury was shown to be susceptible to abiotic photodegradation in epilimnetic lake water samples from the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada(5). The rates were first order with respect to methylmercury concentrations and intensity of solar radiation; a photodegration rate constant of 0.43/day was estimated(5), corresponding to a half-life of 1.6 days(SRC).",

The change of speciation of mercury from inorganic to methylated is the first step in aquatic bioaccumulation(2). Fish readily bioconcentrate methylmercury either directly through water or through components of the food chain(3). Using an aquatic model of methylmercury uptake by Ottawa River (Canada) yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and combining results from field experiments, it was shown that 80% of the methylmercury present in food and 12% present in the water passing over the gills was accumulated by the fish(4). Another study determined that rainbow trout accumulated 10% of methylmercury via the gills and 70% via ingestion(4). Factors which affect the observed levels of mercury in plants and animals at different trophic levels include age, surface area, metabolism, habitat, and activity(5). Loss appears to occur in two stages: first, methylmercury is distributed throughout the tissues, over a period of a few weeks, and then is discharged very slowly from the established binding sites(5). The depurative half-life in fish varies between 1 and 3 years(5). In a 12-day bioaccumulation study using zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio), it was noted that when silver is present in the water jointly with methylmercury, it exerts a negative action on mercury bioaccumulation in the fish, at the whole organism level(6). Following direct contamination of Salmo gairdneri using HgCl2 and CH3HgCl for 30 days, it was noted that mercury accumulation was 6 times greater when methylmercury was used(7).",

Starfish, Leptasterias polaris, exposed for 48 hrs to seawater containing 0.35 nmol/cu dm of radiolabeled methylmercury accumulated 0.53 nmol, corresponding to a first-order uptake rate constant of 0.102/hr(2). Introduction of 0.2 and 1.0 ug/L methylmercury into a sediment/water aquarium with burrowing mayfly nymphs of Hexagenia rigida and a 15 day exposure resulted in a mercury concentration in the nymphs of 400 and 1150 ug/L at 15 \u00b0C and 400 and 750 ug/L at 25 \u00b0C, respectively(3). The effect of pH appears to be minimal at the lower concentration but substantial using the high concentration, e.g. 800 and 2000 ug/L at pH 5 and pH 7.5, respectively, temperature of 25 \u00b0C(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Using a 2X10-2 M concentration, four soils, Freehold sandy loam - A horizon, Freehold sandy loam - B horizon, Penn silt loam, and Rockaway stony loam collected from New Jersey - were used in assessing the effects of pH, chloride, and calcium on monomethylmercury adsorption(2). Maximum adsorption occurred at near pH 6 for all four soils and a larger silt plus clay content and a larger organic matter content resulted in greater adsorption(2). Methylmercury molecules are rapidly adsorbed on clay minerals through several mechanisms, which depend on the structure of the clays; from highest affinity to least are as follows: expandable clays (montmorillonite), Kf = 0.233, is greater than nonexpandable clays (kaolinite), Kf = 0.180, and with mineral oxides, goethite being greater than hausmanite(3). The watershed may be influential in introducing methylmercury to fast-flushing, high-DOC lakes, and once in the water column, dissolved organic carbon-bound methylmercury may be resistant to entering lake sediments(4).",

However, it has been shown that methylmercury was transported from a sludge-amended soil contaminated with inorganic and methylmercury to the environment by emission to the atmosphere(1). Using sediments from East Bay Lake in northwestern Ontario, Canada, experiments were performed to examine the effect of dissolved organic carbon on the partitioning of methylmercury between lake sediments and water(2). Approximately 80% of the methylmercury added in the partitioning experiment was lost either due to demethylation or volatilization(2). This occurred more slowly with increasing dissolved organic carbon concentration(2).",

Surface water samples were collected from Poplar Creek, Oak Ridge, TN, where, as a result of the lithium-isotope separation process used in the production of thermonuclear fusion weapons during the mid-1950s and early 1960s, 150 tons of mercury were released(2). These samples contained 0.08-0.7 ng/L and 0.05-0.3 ng/L methylmercury downstream and upstream from the East Fork Poplar Creek confluence, respectively(2). Concentrations increased with distance downstream from the source. High concentrations of methylmercury in surface water and sediment near the mouth of Poplar Creek appear to be the result of sediment deposition and resuspension, apparently caused by the stronger Clinch River current acting as a barrier and its backflow into the creek as a result of hydropower operations(2). Methylmercury concentrations in Okareka, Okaro, Tarawera, Rotorua, and Rotomahana Lakes, New Zealand were 0.09, 0.51, 0.21, 0.23, and 0.36 ng/L from samples taken summer and fall of 1993 and 1994(3).",

Methylmercury ion concentrations varied from about 2 to 28 ng Hg/g dry weight in sediments collected from the Carson River system in Nevada which is contaminated as a result of mercury mining(5). Sediment samples were collected from Poplar Creek, Oak Ridge, TN, where, as a result of the lithium-isotope separation process used in the production of thermonuclear fusion weapons during the mid-1950s and early 1960s, 150 tons of mercury were released(6). These samples contained 1.0-12 ng/g methylmercury downstream from the East Fork Poplar Creek confluence, and increased with distance downstream from the source(6). High concentrations of methylmercury in surface water and sediment near the mouth of Poplar Creek appear to be the result of sediment deposition and resuspension, apparently caused by the stronger Clinch River current acting as a barrier and its backflow into the creek as a result of hydropower operations(6). 1980-1984, sediments from Finnish lakes and reservoirs, 5 sites (organic mercury content), mean concentration range 0.09-0.21 mg/kg dry wt(2). The concentration in sediment from Lake 136 near the Laforge hydroelectric reservoir in northern Quebec, Canada ranged from 0.4-1.6 ng/g dry wt(3). Concentrations of methylmercury in the sedimenting section and sediment from stratified Finnish forest lakes ranged from 57.4-196 ng/g dry wt, and 134-254 ng/g dry wt, respectively(4). A median concentration of 4.0 ng/g dry wt was measured in suspended particulate matter collected from the Arctic region between June and October 1991(7). Sediments in the Kosseine River, Germany near a fungicide producing plant contained methylmercury ion concentrations of 180, 35, and 49 mg Hg/kg at 1, 3, and 4 km distance downstream from the discharge point(8).",

Mercury concentrations were typically greater than 1000 ug/g total mercury in sediments collected downstream from an abandoned mercury mine in the Kuskokwim River Basin, southwestern Alaska(2). A concentration of 5,500 ug/g total mercury was reported at the Red Devil Mine. Methylmercury concentrations in stream-sediment samples collected from Red Devil Creek and Cinnabar Creek were generally below 5.0 ng/g and those from the Red Top Mine were below 1.0 ng/g(2). Sediments from a flooded beaver pond 2 km downstream from the Cinnabar Creek mine contained 31 ng/g methylmercury(2).",

The natural or \"background\" mercury concentration for most freshwater fish species appear to range from 50-200 ug/kg and may be <10 ug/kg in short-lived herbivorous species(2). Mercury levels in the majority of commercially important species are <500 ug/kg with average levels usually 100-200 ug/kg except for the larger predatory species such as tuna and swordfish, and also for large slow-growing fish such as halibut(2). FDA fiscal year 1979 survey results (mean total mercury content in muscle tissue, ug/kg wet wt): bass, fresh water - 190; bass, salt water - 70; bluefish - 190; carp - 110; catfish - 100; cod - 150; halibut - 270; perch, fresh water - 130; perch, salt water - 170; pike, walleye - 260; pollack - 50; swordfish - 830; trout, fresh water - 130; trout, sea - 90; white fish - 60(3). Mean mercury levels in selected Great Lake fish as reported in an FDA 1970 survey (ug/kg wet wt) were as follows: Lake Erie: walleye - 580, perch - 240, white bass - 490, and smallmouth bass - 510; Lake St Clair: perch, 880, all other species - 480; Lake Michigan, all types - 110; Lake Ontario, all types - 300; Lake Huron, all types - 190; and Lake Superior, all types - 130(3). In a 1983-84 study, clams collected from the Pungo River in North Carolina contained a total mercury content of 25-32 ng/g wet wt; methylmercury was not detected, detection limit 25 ng/g wet wt(4).",

Organic mercury content in samples collected from 1980 to 1984 from Finnish lakes and reservoirs (5 sites) were as follows: fish, mean concentration range 290-1, 690 ug/kg wet wt; zoobenthos, mean concentration range 40-186 ug/kg wet wt; and zooplankton, mean concentration range 180-380 ug/kg dry wt(2). Samples of yellow eel from various locations in the Dutch Rhine Delta were analyzed. It was noted that accumulation rates and levels of mercury were much higher in the western Rhine delta (1993, 0.25-0.45 mg Hg/kg), which has continuously served as a sedimentation basin for contaminated suspended matter transported from upstream regions, than in the eastern delta (1993, 0.15-0.29 mg Hg/kg), and that mercury concentration also tends to increase with age and length(5). Methylmercury concentrations in 4 fish species from the Rhine River delta in the Netherlands were as follows (mg/kg Hg w/w): pike-perch, 0.24-0.32; yellow eel, 0.080-0.49; roach, 0.050-0.097; and smelt >0.13-0.280, representing 100-120, 85-107, 92-100, and >85-128% methylmercury to total Hg, respectively(5).

Methylmercury concentrations in samples from the Baltic Sea were as follows: fish, 12.5-40.3 ug/kg; mussels, 9.8-16.4 ug/kg; and algae, <0.003-1.4 ug/kg, with the percentage of total mercury attributable to methylmercury being 73.1-99% in fish, 20.1-55.6% in mussels, and <0.2-6.0% in algae(3).

It is assumed that nearly all mercury found in fish is in the form of methylmercury(1). Methylmercury levels in fish from the main gold mining area in the Tapajos river basin, Brazil, as well as from Tres Bocas facing the lake in Amapa state were up to 3.82 ppm, and most of the fish from upstream and some from downstream exceeded the allowable level of 0.5 ppm in Brazil(2). Levels greater than 1200 ug/kg have been found in the edible portions of shark, swordfish, and Mediterranean tuna. Similar levels have been found in pike, walleye, and bass taken from polluted fresh waters(3). Methylmercury content in muscles of the sedentary eel-pout from the North Sea (Jade Bay and Meldorf Bay) and the Baltic Sea (Darsser Ort) in 1994 and 1995 were 62 and 96 ug,g wet wt and 85 and 116 ug/g wet wt, and 35 and 38 ug/g wet wt, respectively(4). Samples of fish collected in June, 1993 near Neckargemuend on the Neckar River, contained the following methylmercury ion concentration ranges: 72-445, 96-290, 16-169, 60-432, and 812 ug/kg in eel, perch, roach, chub, and barbel, respectively, concentration being in proportion to fat content in the fish(5).",

In 1980, total mercury content of Hawaiian seabird eggs sampled was 0.122-0.359 ug/g wet wt(2). In 1978, total mercury content of Royal Tern eggs from the central Texas coast had a mean concentration range of 1.11-1.27 ppm(3). Liver, muscle, and kidney samples from nine species of seabirds were analyzed for methylmercury, with mean percentages of 35, 36, and 66% of total mercury, respectively(4). Methylmercury concentrations in livers from cormorant and duck from the Rhine River delta in the Netherlands were 2.92 and 0.19-0.42 mg/kg Hg wet wt, representing 98 and 79-100% methylmercury to total Hg, respectively(5). Methylmercury levels in tissues of two Risso's Dolphins (Grampus priseus) and one Cuvier's Beaked Whale (Ziphius cavirostris) stranded in Italy on the South Adriatic Sea between June and September 1996 were measured(6); mg/kg wet wt in muscle: 15.68, 14.96, and 7.00; in the lung: 5.84, 7.41, and 3.61; in the liver: 14.70; 7.35, and 9.85; and in the kidney: 5.80, 5.32, and 4.51, respectively(6). Levels of methylmercury in the muscle, liver, and kidney from 7 stranded sperm whales in the southern North Sea during the winter of 1994/95 ranged from (ug/g dry wt) 2.5-3-7, 0.8-3.0, and 0.2-1.4, respectively(7). These are lower than values reported for other toothed whales, possible due to their open ocean niche and diet of deep-sea cephalopods(7).",

Studies were conducted on 3 islands of the Canadian High Arctic, specifically Cornwallis, Devon, and Somerset, 74-76 deg N latitude in July and August of 2005 and 2006; seventeen lakes and five ponds were sampled. Chironomid larvae, pupae, and adults are distinct mercury sources for these landlocked fish, and evidence from nitrogen stable isotopes and published feeding studies suggest differential consumption of these stages may affect methylmercury uptake by Arctic char. Methylmercury concentrations (ng/g dry weight) were 5-100, 25-280, and 60-280 for larvae, pupae, and adults, respectively. It is concluded that biological and food web processes have a greater impact on methylmercury transfer to fish than atmospheric mercury deposition in High Arctic lakes(1).",

The ratio of mercury in breast milk to mercury in whole blood was approximately 1:20 in women exposed to methylmercury via contaminated grain in Iraq between 1971 and 1972 ... Evidence from the Iraqi poisoning incident also showed that lactation decreased blood mercury clearance halftimes from 75 days in males and nonlactating females to 42 days in lactating females; the faster clearance due to lactation was confirmed in mice ... In mice, of the total mercury in the breast milk, approximately 60% was estimated to be methylmercury. /It was/ found that 16% of mercury in human breast milk is methylmercury. Studies in animals indicate that the mercury content of breast milk is proportional to the mercury content of plasma.",

Biota play an important role in the transport of methylmercury(2). Routine application of municipal sewage sludge to crop land significantly increased the concentration methylmercury in surface soil from 0.3 to 8.3 ug/kg(3). Sludge amended soil emitted an average of 12 to 24 pg per cu meter hour of methylmercury ion; and may increase regional atmospheric concentration of methylmercury ion by approximately 5%(3).",

Hair from people in different Mediterranean areas: 9 controls (negligible to moderate fish consumption), methylmercury concentration range 0.01-0.55 ug/g, avg concentration 0.16 ug/g; 26 people, residents of a coastal areas, concentration range 0.39-36.0 ug/g, avg concentration 3.68 ug/g(3). Hair of a Papua New Guinean population, 114 samples, methymercury concentration range 3.2-50.5 ug/g, avg concentration 15.5 ug/g; a nearby control group who consumed a similar amount of fish, 51 samples, methylmercury concentration range 0.62-25.7 ug/g, avg concentration 6.4 ug/g; and a control group who consumed fish much less frequently, 45 samples, methylmercury concentration range 0.33-9.0 ug/g, avg concentration 2.4 ug/g(4). Peruvian population chronically exposed to methylmercury due to long-term, heavy consumption of fish (70% of dietary protein came from fish), mean methylmercury blood level - 82 ng/mL(5). Human placentae, Italy, 22 samples, mean total organic mercury content 0.076 ug/g dry wt(6). In fishermen from two south Atlantic coastal areas of Spain, mean methylmercury ion content in hair was 8.28 ug/g and 6.72 ug/g(7).

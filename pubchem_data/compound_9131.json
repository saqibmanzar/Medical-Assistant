By stopping the reaction at different stages, we discovered that IND was first transformed to IND-quinone and 2NO2-IND, which were then transformed to OH-IND. Mutation assays including Ames tests and cell transformation experiments showed enhancement of the mutagenicity after the activation by the peroxynitrite/Fe(III)porphyrin system. The results also showed that 2NO2-IND and IND-quinone played key roles in the mutagenicity of PAHs after metabolic activation.",

The major metabolites of indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene as formed in vivo in mouse skin have been identified. 8-Hydroxyindeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene is the most abundant metabolite identified. 9-Hydroxyindeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxyindeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene are also major in vivo metabolites in mouse skin. Several minor metabolites were also identified. Among these are trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2,8-trihydroxyindeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2,9-trihydroxyindeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene-1,2-dione, and 10-hydroxyindeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene. The tumor-initiating activity of several of the major in vivo metabolites of indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene has been investigated on mouse skin. Trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxyindeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and 1,2-dihydro-1,2-epoxyindeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene both produced an 80% incidence of tumor-bearing mice at a total initiating dose of 1.0 mg. The activity of this K-region dihydrodiol and K-region oxide was, however, less than that of the parent hydrocarbon. These data suggest that 1,2-dihydro-1,2-epoxyindeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, which is an ultimate mutagenic metabolite of indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, is not the ultimate tumorigenic metabolite on mouse skin. 8-Hydroxyindeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, which is mutagenic when assayed in the presence of a microsomal activation system, exhibited only weak tumor-initiating activity. These results indicate that the principal metabolic activation pathways associated with the mutagenic activity of indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene are not related to its tumor-initiating activity on mouse skin.",

Unlike benzo(a)pyrene, IP is a nonalternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon which is devoid of a bay region.

With a similar activation system, the major metabolites of IP were ... identified ... . trans-1,2-Dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-IP, 8-, 9-, and 10-hydroxy-IP, 8- and 9-hydroxy-trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-IP, and IP-1,2-quinone are among the metabolites formed in vitro. The 1,2-epoxide of indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene is a potent direct-acting mutagen. 8- and 9-hydroxy-IP and the trans-1,2-dihydrodiol had no significant mutagenic activity in S. typhimurium TA100 with metabolic activation. These data suggest that the K-region oxides of IP and of 8- and 9-hydroxy-IP are ultimately responsible for its mutagenic activity.",

There are more than 100 different PAHs. PAHs generally occur as complex mixtures (for example, as part of combustion products such as soot), not as single compounds. PAHs usually occur naturally, but they can be manufactured as individual compounds for research purposes; however, not as the mixtures found in combustion products. ... Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar. They are found throughout the environment in the air, water, and soil. They can occur in the air, either attached to dust particles or as solids in soil or sediment. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

Airborne PAHs may be present in gaseous or particle phases each of which has different human health impacts due to their ultimate fate in the body. Here we report on the simultaneous sampling of both phases of airborne PAHs for the first time in underground platinum mines in South Africa, which was made possible by employing small, portable denuder sampling devices consisting of two polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) multi-channel traps connected in series separated by a quartz fibre filter, which only require small, battery operated portable personal sampling pumps for air sampling. Thermal desorption coupled with comprehensive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GCxGC-TofMS) was used to analyze denuder samples taken in three different platinum mines. The samples from a range of underground environments revealed that PAHs were predominantly found in the gas phase with naphthalene and mono-methylated naphthalene derivatives being detected at the highest concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 18 ug/cu m. The particle bound PAHs were found in the highest concentrations at the idling load haul dump vehicle exhausts with a dominance of fluoranthene and pyrene. Particle associated PAH concentrations ranged from 0.47 to 260 ng/cu m and included benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene. ...",

The aim of this study was to develop a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) gas chromatography (GC)-isotope dilution mass spectrometry method for the quantification of 10 four- to six-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urine samples. Seven of the selected PAHs have been classified as carcinogenic. Under the final conditions, analytes were sampled with a 100-um polydimethylsiloxane SPME fibre for 60 min at 80 \u00b0C and desorbed in the injection port of the GC at 270 \u00b0C. Fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene were separated using a highly arylene-modified phase capillary column and quantified by MS using eight deuterated PAHs as surrogate internal standards. Limits of quantification (LOQ) were in the 0.5- to 2.2-ng/L range. Validation showed linear dynamic ranges up to 340 ng/L, inter- and intra-run precisions <20%, and accuracies within 20% of spiked concentrations. Matrix effect evaluation and the use of control charts to monitor process performances showed that the isotope dilution approach allowed for the control of bias sources. Urinary PAHs were above or equal to LOQ, depending on different compounds, in 58-100% (min-max), 40-100% and 5-39% of samples from coke oven workers (n=12), asphalt workers (n=10) and individuals not occupationally exposed to PAHs (n?=?18), respectively. Chrysene was the most abundant PAH determined with median levels of 62.6, 6.9 and <0.6 ng/L, respectively. These results show that the method is suitable for quantifying carcinogenic PAHs in specimens from individuals with different levels of PAH exposure.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

There is no known use of this compound, other than in research. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: The agent is possibly carcinogenic to humans. Child neuroblastoma risk was increased with higher maternal exposure to IP. ANIMAL STUDIES: In rats, intrapulmonary implantation of IP at doses of 0, 0.16, 0.83 or 4.15 mg induced dose-related increases in the incidence of pulmonary squamous-cell carcinomas and sarcomas. In studies with newborn male and female mice, intraperitoneal injection of IP on postnatal days 1, 8 and 15 induced lung adenomas in 1 out of 11 treated male mice. IP showed no cancer-inducing effects after topical application to mouse skin. IP induced mutations in Salmonella typhimurium in strain TA100 (his-/his+) at a concentration of 20 ug/plate and in strain TA98 at a concentration of 2 ug/plate in the presence of an exogenous metabolic system. Strong photomutagenic response was observed after concomitant exposure of Salmonella typhimurium bacteria strain TA102 to IP and light. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: IP induced 7-ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD) activity in the rainbow trout liver cell line.",

Dexamethasone (Dex) is a synthetic agonist of glucocorticoids. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands, BaP and IND, did not directly activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and Dex did not activate the AhR either. Whenever BaP and IND were added to Dex-treated cultures, they were present with Dex for longer periods, and higher enhancement of Dex-induced transactivation of the GR was found, which indicates that the freshly activated AhR is essential for synergistic interactions with the activated GR. The degree of enhancement of Dex-induced transactivation of the GR by PAHs, BaP /approximately equals/ IND>pyrene, paralleled the potency of PAHs in activating the AhR. This synergistic interaction was more distinct in ovarian granulosa cells (HO23) than in HepG2, 293T, or HeLa cells. In contrast, Dex suppressed AhR-mediated expressions, including AhR and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1 A1 expressions. Dex also counteracted the BaP-induced decrease in cell viability. Crosstalk between the AhR and GR was independent of their expression levels. We concluded that the AhR functionally cross-reacts with the GR, through which transactivation activity of the GR is further enhanced, and in contrast, transactivation activity of the AhR is inhibited. ...",

In this study, we evaluated how particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) modulated the formation of DNA damage induced by carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). Single strand breaks and alkali labile sites, as well as BPDE-N2-dGuo DNA adducts were measured in the competent HepG2 cells by Comet assay and HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. B[a]P, alone or in binary mixture with other PAHs (1 uM each), led to low amounts of strand breaks. In contrast, formation of BPDE-N2-dGuo adducts was significant and found to be enhanced in HepG2 co-treated for 14 h by B[a]P in the presence of either benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F), dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DB[a,h]A) or indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IP). Opposite results were obtained with benzo[k]fluoranthene (B[k]F). The same observations were made when cells were pre-incubated with PAH before incubation with B[a]P. These results show that the interactions between PAHs are not direct competition reactions. Emphasis was then placed on the modulation of B[a]P-induced DNA damage by B[b]F and B[k]F. No difference in the time-course formation of DNA damage was observed. However, dose-response relationship differed between these two PAHs with a concentration-dependent inhibition of BPDE-N2-dGuo DNA by B[k]F whereas a constant level of potentiation for B[b]F was observed for concentrations higher than 1 uM. Altogether, these results show that the genotoxicity of B[a]P in binary mixtures with other carcinogenic PAH may be modulated. In such cases, a potentiation of BPDE-N2-dGuo adduct formation is most often observed with exception of B[k]F. Several biological mechanisms may account for these observations, including binding of PAHs to the Ah receptor (AhR), their affinity toward CYP450 and competition for metabolism. ...",

The results showed that all three metals inhibited EROD activity, while BaP/IP significantly induced the enzyme. However, FL alone decreased EROD activity. Moreover, co-treatment with BaP/IP and heavy metals inhibited PAH-induced EROD activities, while combined exposure to FL and heavy metals induced FL-inhibited EROD activities.",

Concomitant exposing the Salmonella typhimurium bacteria strain TA102 to one of the PAHs and light (1.1 J/sq cm UVA+2.1 J/aq cm visible) without the activation enzyme S9, strong photomutagenic response is observed for anthracene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[ghi]perylene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, and pyrene. Under the same conditions, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, chrysene, and fluorene are weakly photomutagenic. Benzo[b]fluoranthene, fluoranthene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene are not photomutagenic. These results indicate that PAHs can be activated by light and become mutagenic in Salmonella TA102 bacteria. At the same time, the mutagenicity for all the 16 PAHs was examined with the standard mutagenicity test with 10% S9 as the activation system. Benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, chrysene, acenaphthylene, and fluorene are weakly mutagenic, while the rest of the PAHs are not. In general, the photomutagenicity of PAHs in TA102 does not correlate with their S9-activated mutagenicity in either TA102 or TA98/TA100 since they involve different activation mechanisms.",

The metabolites were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electro-spray ionization tandem mass spectrometry as OH-IND, IND-quinone and 2NO2-IND. By stopping the reaction at different stages, we discovered that IND was first transformed to IND-quinone and 2NO2-IND, which were then transformed to OH-IND. Mutation assays including Ames tests and cell transformation experiments showed enhancement of the mutagenicity after the activation by the peroxynitrite/Fe(III)porphyrin system. The results also showed that 2NO2-IND and IND-quinone played key roles in the mutagenicity of PAHs after metabolic activation.",

In this study, we examined maternal exposure to ambient air toxics in pregnancy in relation to neuroblastoma in the child. We ascertained all cases of neuroblastoma listed in the California Cancer Registry 1990-2007 that could be linked to a California birth certificate, and controls were selected at random from California birth records. Average air toxics exposures during pregnancy were determined based upon measures from community-based air pollution monitors. The study included 75 cases and 14,602 controls who lived with 5 km of an air pollution monitor, and we additionally examined results for those living within a smaller radius around the monitor (2.5 km). Logistic regression was used to determine the risk of neuroblastoma with one interquartile range increase in air toxic exposure. Neuroblastoma risk was increased with higher maternal exposure to carbon tetrachloride (OR=2.65, 95%CI 1.07, 6.53) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OR=1.39, 95%CI 1.05, 1.84), particularly indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and dibenz(a,h)anthracene. Hexavalent chromium was associated with neuroblastoma at the 5 km distance (OR=1.32, 95%CI 1.00, 1.74) but not at the 2.5 km distance. ...",

Time-course patterns of urinary 2-naphthol levels in coke-oven workers were examined. Also, the correlation between urinary 2-naphthol levels and PAHs from personal breathing zone samples was analyzed while examining and adjusting possible confounding factors, such as smoking alcohol consumption, and age of human subjects. A total of 8 spot urine samples were collected from each high-exposure group (topside-oven workers, n = 17) and low-exposure group (side-oven workers, n = 25) during the whole working cycle, which consists of six consecutive working days followed by 2 days off. Personal breathing zone samples were collected to quantify PAH intake. A questionnaire was distributed and collected from each worker for assessment of demographic parameters. Our results confirmed that the topside-oven area contained significantly higher PAH levels than the side-oven area. Urinary 2-naphthol levels correlated with the levels of PAH species, including pyrene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benezo[g,h,i]pyrene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, and total PAHs. During the working cycle, urinary 2-naphthol levels remained stable at around 46-97 ng/mg creatinine during the working days and dramatically increased during the off days. After stratification of data based on smoking status, smokers had significantly higher urinary 2-naphthol levels than non-smokers, and 2-naphthol levels positively correlated with smoking status. Coke-oven emissions are a source of exposure to naphthalene. Also, smoking is a significant source of exposure to naphthalene and served as a confounder factor. Due to its abundance, positive association with total PAHs and certain carcinogenic PAH compounds, and slower elimination kinetics, urinary 2-naphthol may have the potential to serve as a biomarker for PAH exposure, when smoking status is carefully adjusted.",

A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 2008-2009 with coke oven workers and steel-rolling workers as the exposed and control groups, respectively. Questionnaires on basic demographic information were administered. Personal breathing zone and urine samples were collected to quantify personal PAH intake and biological response doses. Immunological and cytokine parameters in serum were analyzed. Urinary malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were analyzed to determine oxidative stress induced by PAHs in relation to altered humoral immunological status. Mean levels of serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) and TNF-alpha were significantly increased in coke oven workers compared to steel-rolling workers who had no or minimal PAH exposure (p=0.0033 and p<0.0001, respectively). There were no significant differences in mean levels of IL-4 and IL-10 between coke oven workers and steel-rolling workers. Moderate activation of lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage as determined by plasma MDA and 8-OHdG levels were detected simultaneously with significant alterations in IgA and IgE levels. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that PAHs with high molecular weights >252 (dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene and/or indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene) correlated with IgA and IgE levels. This study showed that coke oven workers with chronic exposure to PAHs may develop immunological alteration. ...",

TCDD and 8 of the PAHs induced EROD activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Seven of these were previously shown to be acutely toxic to avian embryos, while the 10 congeners that did not produce an EROD response caused limited mortality. The rank order potency of the EROD-active congeners in all three species was as follows: TCDD>dibenz[ah]anthracene>benzo[k]fluoranthene>indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene>benzo[a]pyrene>chrysene /approximately equals/ benz[a]anthracene /approximately equals/ benz[ghi]perylene>benzo[b]naphtho[2,3-d]thiophene.

When the duration and cell density of exposure were increased, the EC(50) for EROD induction was relatively constant for TCDD, but increased for PAHs. Regardless of exposure conditions, EROD activity was not induced by 9 PAHs: naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, perylene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, and fluoranthene. Two PAHs, benzo[g,h,i]perylene and coronene, induced EROD activity inconsistently. The remaining 13 PAHs consistently induced EROD activity. The EC(50)s for induction exhibited approximately a 110-fold range. The order of potency, from most to least potent, was benzo[k]fluoranthene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, dibenzo [a,h]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, benzo [b]fluoranthene, pentacene, benzo[b]anthracene, benzo[b] fluorene, chrysene, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[e]pyrene, and triphenylene. When the induction potency was expressed relative to TCDD, the toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) ranged from 0.001 to 0.00001. When expressed relative to benzo[a]pyrene, the TEFs ranged from 3.44 to 0.03.",

The fold increases of EROD and GST activity were calculated and both increased in the order Fluoranthene < Fluorene < Benzo(b)fluoranthene < Benzo(g,h,i)perylene < Indeno(1,2,3-cd)-pyrene. The clear dose-response relationships were found for liver EROD and GST activity induced by PAHs. The enzyme EROD and GST in Carassius auratus were confirmed as useful biomarkers of exposure to both PAH and PAH-like compounds.",

Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene occurs ubiquitously as a product of incomplete combustion. It has been identified in mainstream cigarette smoke; gasoline engine exhaust; diesel engine exhaust; exhaust from burnt coal; lubricating oils and used motor oils; and gasolines. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.3X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.9X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.48X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation half-lives of 288 and 289 days were observed for indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene in Kidman and McLaurin sandy loam soils, respectively, suggesting that biodegradation is a slow process in soilIf released into water, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the log Koc values of 5.78-8.82. In shake flask studies, an initial indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene concentration of 1.9 ug/mL was reduced to 0.9 ug/mL following 2 weeks incubation in contaminated groundwater(9), suggesting that biodegradation may be a slow environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 12,000 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure may be through inhalation and dermal contact with indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene at workplaces where coal and petroleum derived substances are produced or used or where combustion processes are extensive. The general population may be exposed to indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene primarily through the smoking of tobacco, inhalation of polluted air and by ingestion of food. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon a reported Henry's Law constant of 3.48X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(4). Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 12,000(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 6.70(6) and a regression-derived equation(5), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(7). An elimination half-life of 16.2 days was measured in Mytilus edilus(8). In shake flask studies, an initial indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene concentration of 1.9 ug/mL was reduced to 0.9 ug/mL following 2 weeks incubation in contaminated groundwater(9), suggesting that biodegradation may be a slow environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Half-lives for indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene ranged from 730 days, using a synthetic mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons applied and incubated together in Kidman sandy loam soil, to 139 days in a mixture of oil refinery wastes applied to Kidman sandy loam soil(2). A half-life of 288 days was observed for indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene when applied and incubated as a single constituent in Kidman sandy loam soil(2). Biodegradation half-lives of 288 and 289 days were observed for indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene in Kidman and McLaurin sandy loam soils, respectively(3). In soil-water slurry systems, with actual town gas soil, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene was biodegraded approx. 33% after 5 weeks incubation using a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon- acclimated mixed culture(4). In bench-scale biotreatability studies using a solid-phase bioremediation process (land farming chambers containing sediment and soil collected from the American Creosote Works Superfund site, Pensacola, FL), the indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene concentration was reduced from 29.7 to 29.2 mg/land farming chamber in unamended surface soil; 29.7 to 24.3 mg/land farming chamber in nutrient-amended surface soil; 67.8 to 54.0 mg/land farming chamber in unamended sediment; and 67.8 to 47.4 mg/land farming chamber in nutrient-amended sediment following 12 weeks incubation(5). In shake flask studies, an initial indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene concentration of 1.9 ug/mL was reduced to 0.9 ug/mL following 2 weeks incubation in contaminated groundwater from the American Creosote Works Superfund site, Pensacola, FL(6). Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene was removed up to 95% over 36 days in an activated sludge pilot reactor, 40-65% was attributed to biodegradation(7).

Dark-corrected photolysis half-lives for indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene adsorbed onto fly ash and irradiated with a mercury vapor lamp ranged from 116 to 1000 hours for a light gray and a black fly ash, respectively; dark-corrected photolysis half-lives for indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene adsorbed onto carbon black, silica gel and alumina were 1000, 62.0 and 38.9 hours, respectively(3). Overall initial decay rates of indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene on wood soot particles exposed to midday sunlight were 0.0143, 0.0066, and 0.0007/min at 20.1, 11.7, and -7 \u00b0C, respectively(4). These correspond to respective half-lives of 48, 105, and 990 minutes(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene was detected in sewage sludge at 0.06-6.86 mg/kg (UK), <1.6 mg/kg (US) and 0.281-0.67 mg/kg (Germany)(3). Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene concentrations of 5-10 ug/L (0.06-0.12 ug/g) up to 160-240 ug/L (4.57-6.86 ug/g) were found in UK sewage sludge samples(4). Effluent from Norwegian sewage treatment plants contained <5 ng/L indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene(5). Average indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene concentrations associated with the solid phase in raw sewage, primary effluent and secondary effluent from the Hamilton Woodward plant, a conventional activated sludge treatment facility, were 12.1, 7.2 and 0.6 ug/g, respectively(6). Mean effluent and influent indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene concentrations were 0.011-0.019 and 0.11-0.37 ug/L, respectively in six municipal waste water treatment plants in the Netherlands(7). Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene was detected in an effluent channel from a coking plant(8). Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene was detected in scrubber waste water from aluminum smelters in Lista and Vefsnfjord, Norway in 1991 at 500 and 150 ng/L, respectively(9). Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene was reported at not detected to 48 ng/L in the raw wastewater, treated wastewater and streams of wastewater from treatment plants in Jordan(10). Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene was reported at 1017.40-2682.70 ug/kg in sewage sludge from 4 of 6 waste water treatment plants in Beijing, China; multiple samples were collected Feb 2004 to May 2005(11). At 13 of 14 sampling points across a sewage treatment network in Maresme, Spain, the concentration of indeno(1,2,3-indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene was below detection limit of 1.00 ng/L, it was detected in the influent sample at 9.00 ng/L(12). In the National Urban Runoff Program, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene was not detected (86 samples from 19 cities)(13). Samples of urban runoff collected in Madrid contained indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene at a mean annual concentration of 0.2 ug/L(14).",

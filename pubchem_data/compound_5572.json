It is one of the centrally acting muscarinic antagonists used for treatment of parkinsonian disorders and drug-induced extrapyramidal movement disorders and as an antispasmodic. Trihexyphenidyl is a selective M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. It is able to discriminate between the M1 (cortical or neuronal) and the peripheral muscarinic subtypes (cardiac and glandular). Trihexyphenidyl partially blocks cholinergic activity in the CNS, which is responsible for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It is also thought to increase the availability of dopamine, a brain chemical that is critical in the initiation and smooth control of voluntary muscle movement.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The maximum therapeutic response attainable with trihexyphenidyl is in the range of 20-30% symptomatic improvement in 50-75% of patients. Frequently, the maximum response requires empiric combination of trihexyphenidyl with other antimuscarinic drugs or with antihistaminic or dopaminergic agents. Some clinicians believe trihexyphenidyl to be of little value, but the majority have found it a useful adjunct in the multidimensional therapeutic approach to parkinsonian syndrome.

The oxime HI-6 when combined with centrally acting anticholinergic drug trihexyphenidyle seems to be more efficacious in the elimination of acute toxic effects of soman than its combination with atropine. The findings support the hypothesis that the choice of the anticholinergic drug is important for the effectiveness of antidotal mixture in the case of antidotal treatment of soman-induced acute poisoning.",

Adverse effects of trihexyphenidyl, which are experienced by 30-50% of patients receiving the drug, may include dryness of the mouth, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, and nervousness. Other adverse effects typical of those produced by antimuscarinic drugs include constipation, tachycardia, mydriasis, urinary hesitancy or retention, drowsiness, increased intraocular tension, weakness, vomiting, and headache. CNS stimulation, usually manifested by restlessness, agitation, confusion, delirium, and hallucination or euphoria may occur with high dosage, or in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to other drugs, or in patients with arteriosclerosis. Isolated instances of rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and suppurative parotitis secondary to dryness of the mouth have been reported. Angle-closure glaucoma has reportedly occurred in patients receiving prolonged therapy with trihexyphenidyl. Rarely, psychiatric disturbances such as delusion, amnesia, depersonalization, a sense of unreality, and one possible case of paranoia have been reported with trihexyphenidyl. The incidence and severity of adverse effects are generally dose related and adverse effects may occasionally be obviated by reduction in dosage. If a severe reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued for several days and then readministered at a lower dosage.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

The subcellular distribution of BP or TP used clinically conformed with that of QNB, a typical potent central muscarinic antagonist. The concentration-time courses of the brain subcellular fractions for these drugs were of two types which decreased slowly and in parallel to the plasma concentration. The subcellular distribution in the brain and heart was dependent on the protein amount of each fraction. The percent post-nuclear fraction (P2) of the total concentration in the lung was characteristically about 3-5 times larger than that in the heart. It was elucidated that the distribution in the lung differs from that in the brain and heart, with high affinity which is not dependent on the protein amount in the P2 fraction containing lysosomes. On the other hand, at a low dose (650 ng/kg) of 3H-QNB, each fraction as a percentage of the total concentration in the brain increased in synaptic membrane and synaptic vesicles and decreased in nuclei and cytosol as compared with the high dose. These results show that although the tissue concentration-time courses of anticholinergic drugs appear to decrease simply in parallel to plasma concentration, the subcellular distribution exhibits a variety of patterns among various tissues.",

The dosage regimens were (1) a 5-mg immediate release (IR) tablet given twice daily at time zero and 12 hr later, and (2) two 5-mg sustained-release (SR) capsule formulations given daily. The number of adverse experiences following the SR formulation were approximately 50% of those for the IR formulation, the peak concentration (Cmax) after the SR formulation was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than that after the first dose of the IR formulation, and the time to reach Cmax (tmax) was significantly longer after the SR formulation (p less than 0.05). The SR formulation maintained serum concentrations above 50, 60, and 70% of Cmax values for average time periods of 11.7, 9.4, and 5.9 hr, respectively, compared with values of 1.8, 1.2, and 0.9 hr after the IR formulation; the differences were all significant (p less than 0.05). The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) was similar (p greater than 0.05) after the SR (10.1 hr) and IR (8.7 hr) formulations. The statistical power of the study was 98.1% to detect a 20% difference in the area under the curve from time zero to time infinity (AUC0----infinity) between formulations. Although the AUC0----infinity after the SR formulation was statistically smaller (p less than 0.05) than after the IR tablet, the difference was less than 20%. Therefore, the SR formulation was bioequivalent to the IR tablet formulation of trihexyphenidyl. /Trihexylphenidyl hydrochloride/",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum. Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.",

The PET study and an assessment of the disability and cognitive impairment were performed before and after administration of 6 mg trihexyphenidyl for 5 to 11 weeks. All PD patients showed improvements in motor symptoms after the trihexyphenidyl treatment. Cognitive function did not significantly differ between before and after trihexyphenidyl treatment. However, after trihexyphenidyl treatment, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional oxygen metabolic rate (rCMRO2) decreased by 15% in the striatum and by 10% in all cortical areas contralateral to predominantly symptomatic limbs, and by 10% in the ipsilateral striatum and all cortical areas, significantly below the values of controls in most cerebral cortices and striatum.

In addition, trihexyphenidyl exhibits a direct spasmolytic action on smooth muscle and exhibits weak mydriatic, antisialagogue, and cardiovagal blocking effects. The exact mechanism of action of trihexyphenidyl in parkinsonian syndrome is not understood but may result from blockade of efferent impulses and from central inhibition of cerebral motor centers. In small doses, trihexyphenidyl depresses the CNS but larger doses cause cerebral excitement resembling the signs of atropine toxicity.",

In normal rats, continuous perfusion of trihexyphenidyl (1 mM) via the microdialysis probe induced a significant increase in striatal dopamine release, followed by a decrease to below baseline values. A similar effect was observed, though less pronounced, in denervated striatum of rats with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway. In these hemi-Parkinson rats, continuous striatal perfusion of trihexyphenidyl had no effect on the biotransformation of locally applied L-dopa (2 uM for 20 min) to dopamine in either intact or denervated striatum. However, systemic administration of trihexyphenidyl (1.5 mg/kg ip) produced an attenuation of the L- dopa-induced dopamine release in the intact striatum (contralateral to the lesion) of hemi-Parkinson rats. This effect was absent in the denervated striatum of these animals. We confirmed that L-dopa induces an increase in striatal dopamine output which is influenced by the severity of the dopaminergic denervation. The absence of an effect of trihexyphenidyl locally applied in the striatum, on biotransformation of L-dopa suggests that the site of action of antimuscarinic drugs may not be in the striatum and, therefore, remains unclear.",

In a group of 22 psychiatric patients receiving long-term antipsychotic medication concurrently with trihexyphenidyl the effects of trihexyphenidyl withdrawal were studied double-blind and placebo controlled. Anxiety, psychotic symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms and salivary flow were monitored. Blood pressure, pulse, sleep duration, weight and body temperature were recorded daily. The result was a recognizable withdrawal syndrome indicated by an increase in anxiety with various physical complaints, as well as evidence of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. A temporary deterioration was noted in psychotic symptomatology and extrapyramidal symptoms. The majority of the parameters regained baseline values, indicating the symptoms were related to the discontinuation of trihexyphenidyl and supporting the existence of a withdrawal syndrome.",

Both of these drugs (0.1-10 mg/kg, sc) showed dose-dependent amnesic effects in the acquisition and retrieval phases. However, the effect induced by trihexyphenidyl was transient, whereas that of biperiden was long-lasting. To clarify the reason for the different duration of the amnesic activity, binding to the muscarinic receptor was examined. In the Scatchard analysis, trihexyphenidyl competed with [(3)H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([(3)H]QNB) on the muscarinic receptor (showed increased K(d) and unchanged B(max) value), while biperiden decreased [(3)H]QNB binding (B(max) value) significantly. Furthermore, in an exchange assay for receptor inactivation, trihexyphenidyl binding to muscarinic receptors was exchanged by [(3)H]QNB completely, but biperiden decreased the exchangeable binding of [(3)H]QNB in a dose dependent manner (0.1-100 nM). ...",

The results showed that benactyzine, caramiphen, and trihexyphenidyl reduced rats' innate preference for novelty, whereas biperiden and procyclidine did not. When benactyzine, caramiphen, and trihexyphenidyl were combined with physostigmine the cognitive impairment disappeared. This counteracting effect, however, caused changes in locomotor and rearing activities not seen by each drug alone. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and anticholinergics used as prophylactics can offset each other, but exceptions are observed in a previous study when a very potent anticholinergic (scopolamine) or a high dose of procyclidine still results in cognitive deficits in spite of coadministration with physostigmine.",

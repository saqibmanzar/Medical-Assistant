Its main therapeutic use is in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease where it is used to increase cortical acetylcholine. It has an oral bioavailability of 100% and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Because it has a half life of about 70 hours, it can be taken once a day. Initial dose is 5 mg per day, which can be increased to 10 mg per day after an adjustment period of at least 4 weeks. Donepezil is a centrally acting reversible acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor. Its main therapeutic use is in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease where it is used to increase cortical acetylcholine. It is well absorbed in the gut with an oral bioavailability of 100% and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Because it has a half life of about 70 hours, it can be taken once a day. Currently, there is no definitive proof that use of donepezil or other similar agents alters the course or progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, 6-12 month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition and/or behavior. Pilot studies have reported that donepezil therapy may potentially have effects on markers of disease progression, such as hippocampal volume. Therefore, many neurologists, psychiatrists, and primary care physicians use donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In 2005, the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) withdrew its recommendation for use of the drug for mild-to-moderate AD, on the basis that there is no significant improvement in functional outcome; Currently, there is no definitive proof that use of donepezil or other similar agents alters the course or progression of Alzheimer's disease.

However, NICE revised its guidelines to suggest that donepezil be used in moderate stage patients for whom the evidence is strongest. While the drug is currently indicated for mild to moderate Alzheimer's, there is also evidence from 2 trials that it may be effective for moderate to severe disease. An example of this is a Karolinska Institute paper published in The Lancet in early 2006, which states that donepezil improves cognitive function even in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease symptoms. of quality of life or of behavioral symptoms.

An example of this is a Karolinska Institute paper published in The Lancet in early 2006, which states that donepezil improves cognitive function even in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease symptoms. Donepezil is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. If this proposed mechanism of action is correct, donepezil's effect may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. Donepezil has been tested in other cognitive disorders including Lewy body dementia and Vascular dementia, but it is not currently approved for these indications. Donepezil has also been studied in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, post-coronary bypass cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment associated with multiple sclerosis, and Down syndrome.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

A study of the pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled donepezil demonstrated that about 53% of plasma radioactivity appeared as donepezil in the unchanged form, and 11% was identified as the metabolite 6-O-desmethyl donepezil, which exerts similar potency inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme.

Unchanged donepezil accounted for the largest component of the recovered dose in each matrix. Three metabolic pathways were identified: (i) O-dealkylation and hydroxylation to metabolites M1 and M2, with subsequent glucuronidation to metabolites M11 and M12; (ii) hydrolysis to metabolite M4; and (iii) N-oxidation to metabolite M6. In plasma, the parent compound accounted for about 25% of the dose recovered during each sampling period, as well as of the cumulative dose recovered. The recovered residue showed higher levels of the hydroxylated metabolites M1 and M2 than of their glucuronide conjugates M11 and M12, respectively. In urine, the parent compound accounted for 17%, on average, of the dose recovered from each pooled sample, as well as of the total recovered dose. The major metabolite was the hydrolysis product M4, followed by the glucuronidated conjugates M11 and M12. In feces, the parent compound also predominated, although it accounted for only 1%, of the recovered dose. A large percentage of the radioactivity in feces consisted of unidentified very polar metabolites, which were retained at the TLC origin. Of the extracted metabolites, the hydroxylation products M1 and M2 were the most abundant, followed by the hydrolysis product M4 and the N-oxidation product M6. Donepezil is hepatically metabolized and the predominant route for the elimination of both parent drug and its metabolites is renal, as 79% of the recovered dose was found in the urine with the remaining 21% found in the feces. Moreover, the parent compound, donepezil, is the predominant elimination product in urine. The major metabolites of donepezil include M1 and M2 (via O-dealkylation and hydroxylation), M11 and M12 (via glucuronidation of M1 and M2, respectively), M4 (via hydrolysis) and M6 (via N-oxidation).",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Donepezil selectively and reversibly inhibits the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which normally breaks down acetylcholine. The main pharmacological actions of this drug are believed to occur as the result of this enzyme inhibition, enhancing cholinergic transmission, which relieves the symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia. In addition to the above, other mechanisms of action of donepezil are possible, including the opposition of glutamate-induced excitatory transmission via downregulation of NMDA receptors and the regulation of amyloid proteins, which have demonstrated significant effects on the disease process of Alzheimer's. Other possible targets for donepezil may also include the inhibition various inflammatory signaling pathways, exerting neuroprotective effects.",

As a result, the concentration of acetylcholine increases at cholinergic synapses. In vitro data and data in animals indicate that the anticholinesterase activity of donepezil is relatively specific for acetylcholinesterase in the brain compared with butyrylcholinesterase inhibition in peripheral tissues.",

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

During the procedure, succinylcholine-induced relaxation was prolonged and the effect of atracurium besylate was inadequate even at higher doses than those indicated for the patient's weight. Cholinesterase blood tests performed 10 months, 1 month and 10 days before surgery had demonstrated a gradual decrease in the duration of activity of the enzyme. Such an effect, which has been described for cholinesterase inhibitors like neostigmine and donepezil, would explain the prolonged effect of succinylcholine. After ruling out other causes for resistance to atracurium, we conclude that donepezil or its metabolites acted on muscle plaque, blocking acetylcholine hydrolysis and antagonizing atracurium.",

She was also hypertensive and receiving long term treatment with atenolol and doxazosin. On examination she was normotensive (140/80 mm Hg) and had moderate cognitive impairment (score in mini-mental state examination 15/30 and on the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale 46/75). Routine haematological and biochemical tests gave normal results (platelet count 146 X 10+9/L), and a computed tomogram of the brain was normal. Probable Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed according to published criteria,2 and treatment with donepezil 5 mg daily was started. After 4 days she developed diarrhea and vomiting. On review she had a purpuric rash on her trunk and her arms and legs. Donepezil treatment was stopped, with resolution of the gastrointestinal symptoms, which were thought to be a result of gastroenteritis as another family member was affected. The rash began to fade.After discussion with the patient and her carer we cautiously restarted donepezil treatment. On review 16 days later an obvious recurrence of the purpuric rash was noted on her trunk and legs, although she had not had a recurrence of the gastrointestinal symptoms. Donepezil treatment was stopped. Successive platelet counts were 119 X 10+9/L and 157 X 10+9/L, and the rash had almost resolved when she was reviewed six weeks after rechallenge with donepezil.  Donepezil was thought to be the cause of this rash because of the temporal association with treatment and its recurrence on rechallenge.",

A 79-year-old white nursing home patient with a history of Alzheimer disease and hypertension was inadvertently given 50 mg of donepezil instead of her usual 5-mg dose. She presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and persistent bradycardia (HR in the 40s). Routine laboratory studies were all within normal limits. Basilar rales were noted five hours after arrival. She was treated with atropine 0.2 mg as needed for bradycardia (HR <50 beats/min); a total of 3.0 mg was administered over 18 hours. Each bolus kept her HR >60 beats/min for one-half to two hours. No further vomiting or evidence of pulmonary edema occurred after her initial episodes. She returned to baseline by day 2 (HR in the 70s) and was returned to the nursing home. ...",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.8X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates donepezil will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase donepezil will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Donepezil does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, donepezil is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 4.0X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, donepezil ist expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 190 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to donepezil may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where donepezil is produced or used. Exposure to donepezil among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug Aricept, a nootropic. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

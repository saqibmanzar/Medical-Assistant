When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

Pentamidine-induced nephrotoxicity is manifested by an increase in serum creatinine concentration and/or BUN, usually developing gradually and appearing during the second week of therapy with the drug. Azotemia also has been reported. Renal insufficiency is usually mild to moderate in severity and reversible following discontinuance of pentamidine; however, acute renal failure (e.g., serum creatinine concentration greater than 6 mg/dL) or severe renal insufficiency requiring discontinuance of the drug may occur occasionally. Limited evidence suggests that nephrotoxicity and hyperkalemia both may occur more frequently in patients with AIDS than in other patients treated with parenteral pentamidine; hyperkalemia has been severe in some patients. Rarely, pentamidine-induced acute renal failure has been associated with myoglobinuria or gross hematuria. The risk and degree of pentamidine-induced renal impairment may be increased in the presence of dehydration or by concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs. Acute renal failure has been reported in at least 1 patient receiving pentamidine inhalation therapy; flank pain and nephritis also have been reported occasionally in patients receiving the aerosolized drug by oral inhalation via nebulizer.",

The risk of hypotensive reactions following IM or IV administration of pentamidine isethionate has not been directly compared, but some data suggest that there is no difference in the frequency of these reactions following either route of administration when IV infusions of the drug are administered over a period of at least 60 minutes. Hypotensive reactions may be particularly likely to occur following rapid IV injection or infusion. To minimize the risk of this adverse effect when pentamidine isethionate is administered IV, infusions of the drug should be given over a period of 60-120 minutes. However, hypotension, which was not ameliorated by adjustment of the infusion rate, persisted beyond completion of the infusion, and required volume expansion for correction, has been reported in some patients. Hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations, syncope, dizziness, light-headedness, diaphoresis, cerebrovascular accident, vasodilatation, and vasculitis have been reported occasionally in patients receiving orally inhaled pentamidine.",

As well, a seventh putative metabolite has been discovered and identified as para-hydroxybenzamidine, a fragment of the original drug. ... the cytochromes P-450 have been demonstrated as the enzyme system responsible for pentamidine metabolism ... the mixed-function oxidases readily convert pentamidine to hydroxylated metabolites, but exactly which isozyme(s) of cytochrome P-450 is responsible is not clear.",

With the synthesis and identification of 5-(4'-amidinophenoxy)pentanoic acid and 5-(4'-amidinophenoxy)-1-pentanol as the remaining two metabolites, the primary metabolism of pentamidine in rats appears fully characterized. ... Isolated, perfused rat livers were used with [14C]pentamidine to identify secondary metabolites. Only two novel radioactive peaks were detected by HPLC analysis of perfused liver samples. The treatment of liver samples with sulfatase or beta-glucuronidase resulted in the reduction or elimination of these peaks and gave rise to peaks identified as para-hydroxybenzamidine and 5-(4'-amidinophenoxy)pentanoic acid. It was concluded from these results that only these two primary metabolites were conjugated with sulfate or glucuronic acid.",

Up to now, it has been thought that therapeutic compounds causing QT prolongation are associated with direct block of the cardiac potassium channel human ether a-go-go-related gene (hERG), which encodes the alpha subunit of cardiac I(Kr) currents. /The authors/ show that pentamidine has no acute effects on currents produced by hERG, KvLQT1/mink, Kv4.3, or SCNA5. Cardiac calcium currents and the guinea pig cardiac action potential were also not affected. After overnight exposure, however, pentamidine reduced hERG currents and inhibited trafficking and maturation of hERG with IC(50) values of 5 to 8 uM similar to therapeutic concentrations. Surface expression determined in a chemiluminescence assay was reduced on exposure to 10, 30, and 100 uM pentamidine by about 30, 40, and 70%, respectively. These effects were specific for hERG since expression of hKv1.5, KvLQT1/minK, and Kv4.3 was not altered. In isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, 10 uM pentamidine prolonged action potential duration APD(90) from 374.3  or + or - 57.1 to 893.9 + or - 86.2 ms on overnight incubation. I(Kr) tail current density was reduced from 0.61 + or - 0.09 to 0.39 + or - 0.04 pA/pF. /The authors/ conclude that pentamidine prolongs the cardiac action potential by block of hERG trafficking and reduction of the number of functional hERG channels at the cell surface. /The authors/ propose that pentamidine, like arsenic trioxide, produces QT prolongation and torsades de pointes in patients by inhibition of hERG trafficking.",

The cytotoxic properties of pentamidine isethionate (2) towards the promastigotes of the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum /was determined/. The leishmanicidal activity of 2 was 60 times higher after 72 hr of incubation than that of cisplatin. The pentamidine salt 2 induced a higher amount of programmed cell death (PCD) than cisplatin, which is associated with inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell-cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Circular dichroism (CD) data indicate that binding of 2 to calf-thymus DNA (CT-DNA) induces conformational changes in the DNA double helix, consistent with a B-->A transition. Moreover, the interaction of 2 with ubiquitin led to a 6% increase in the beta-sheet content of the protein as observed by CD spectroscopy. Fluorescence-spectroscopy studies agreed with the CD data, showing that the pentamidine portion of 2 induces a significant decrease in the fluorescence of the Ub residues Phe4 and Phe45 located on the beta-cluster of the molecule, but not of Tyr59 on the alpha-cluster. These data indicate that pentamidine specifically modifies the beta-cluster, i.e., the 'basic face' of ubiquitin. ... /The/ results suggest that the biochemical mechanism of action of pentamidine may be a consequence of its dual binding to DNA and proteins.",

Maximal stimulation of respiration and ATPase activity was observed at a concentration of pentamidine of 200-300 microM. Higher concentrations had an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial respiration. As it happens with other cationic uncouplers, the uncoupling effect of pentamidine required inorganic phosphate. Pentamidine-induced uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation was accompanied by an efflux of Ca2+ from the mitochondria and partial collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential.",

The exhaust air from these units should pass through a HEPA filter before being released into the room or exhausted to the outside. These local exhaust ventilation systems capture the air contaminants at or near the source and remove them without exposing persons in the area. Local exhaust ventilation is preferable and more efficient than general ventilation, which involves the dilution and removal of contaminants in a much larger volume of air, such as a whole room. If local exhaust ventilation cannot be used, or during the interim period when controls are being implemented, efforts should be made to ensure that the pentamidine administration room is under negative pressure relative to adjacent areas and that a minimum of six air changes per hour are provided in accordance with guidelines for respiratory isolation rooms. Air should be exhausted directly to the outside, not recirculated to other areas within the facility. If this is not possible, room air must be passed through a HEPA filter before being recirculated back into the room or to other areas of the facility. Ideally, the pentamidine administration rooms should be set up to meet these guidelines even if local exhaust ventilation is used, to further reduce the potential for exposure to pentamidine and M. tuberculosis.",

Aseptic technique is important for protecting hazardous drugs from possible contamination. However, it is also important to consider worker protection and to assure that worker safety and health is not sacrificed. Therefore, when asepsis is required or recommended, use ventilated cabinets designed for both hazardous drug containment and aseptic processing. Aseptic requirements are generally regulated by individual State boards of pharmacy. When asepsis is not required, a Class I BSC or an isolator intended for containment applications (a containment isolator) may be sufficient. When aseptic technique is required, use one of the following ventilated cabinets: Class II BSC (Type B2 is preferred, but Types A2 and B1 are allowed under certain conditions); Class III BSC; Isolators intended for asepsis and containment (aseptic containment isolators). Air flow and exhaust: regardless of type, equip each ventilated cabinet with a continuous monitoring device to confirm adequate air flow before each use. Use a high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA filter) for the exhaust from these controls, and where feasible, exhaust 100% of the filtered air to the outside. Install the outside exhaust so that the exhausted air is not pulled back into the building by the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems or by the windows, doors, or other points of entry. Place fans downstream of the HEPA filter so that contaminated ducts are maintained under negative pressure. Do not use a ventilated cabinet that recirculates air inside the cabinet or exhausts air back into the room environment unless the hazardous drug(s) in use will not volatilize (evaporate) while they are being handled or after they are captured by the HEPA filter. Information about volatilization should be supplied by the drug manufacturer (possibly in the MSDS) or by air-sampling data. Seek additional information about placement of the cabinet, exhaust system, and stack design from NSF/ANSI 49-2002. Incorporate their recommendations regardless of the type of ventilated cabinet selected. /Hazardous drugs/"

Use of surgical masks by health-care personnel caring for pentamidine-treated patients probably is unlikely to provide an effective means for reducing environmental exposure to the drug; therefore, if a face mask is used, alternative, appropriately designed (e.g., for adequate particle-size filtration) and well-fitted face masks (e.g., 3M Company model 9970 or 9920) should be employed since they are more likely to substantially reduce respiratory exposure levels.",

In this study in a rat model, the nephrotoxicity was assessed by measuring urinary loss of tubular cells, malate dehydrogenase activity and creatinine clearance. In addition, we studied the influence of other nephrotoxins such as tobramycin, amphotericin B and cyclosporin on the pentamidine-associated nephrotoxicity and proved the possibilities of reducing this toxicity by coadministration with other drugs. The tubular toxicity of pentamidine (1, 10 or 20 mg/kg daily) is dose-related and reversible. The toxicity can be reduced by coadministration of fosfomycin (1 x 500 or 2 x 250 mg/kg daily) and D-glucaro-1,5-lactam (2 x 5 mg/kg daily) and enhanced by tobramycin (2 x 2.5 mg/kg daily), amphotericin B (1 mg/kg daily) and cyclosporin (10 mg/kg daily). Furthermore, an increase in the creatinine clearance in pentamidine-treated rats can be obtained with both verapamil (2 x 1.5 mg/kg daily) and enalapril (5 mg/kg daily).",

Predisposing risk factors for adverse drug reactions were identified. Adverse drug reactions were included if they occurred during or within 1 week following the discontinuation of pentamidine treatment. Nephrotoxicity, dysglycemia, hepatotoxicity, hyperkalemia, and hyperamylasemia accounted for 80% of adverse drug reactions (n = 174) that occurred in 76 (71.7%) of 106 patients during 84 treatment courses of pentamidine. A significant relationship between hypoglycemia and nephrotoxicity was observed (P = 0.002). Four factors were significantly associated with occurrence of an adverse drug reaction: number of concomitant medications (odds ratio (OR) = 1.36, P = 0.005), nonwhite ethnicity (OR = 5.00, P = 0.017), cumulative dosage of pentamidine (OR = 1.03, P = 0.030), and concurrent use of other nephrotoxic drugs (OR = 2.34, P = 0.047). Two factors, daily dosage and history of intravenous drug use, approached significance. Knowledge of and avoidance of potential risk factors might allow safer use of pentamidine and reduce the prevalence of adverse drug reactions.",

IV injection of pentamidine (and other diamidines) can be followed by alarming and sometimes dangerous reactions. These include breathlessness, tachycardia, dizziness or fainting, headache, and vomiting. These reactions probably relate to the sharp fall in blood pressure that follows too rapid iv admin of the drug, and they may be due in part to the release of histamine. If soln of pentamidine cannot be given slowly by the IV route, the drug is well tolerated after intramuscular injection. However, the latter route is associated with formation of sterile abscesses at the injection site. Pentamidine does not appear to cause late neuropathies. Pancreatitis and hypoglycemia and, paradoxically, hyperglycemia and insulin-dependent diabetes have been documented following its admin; the hypoglycemia may be life-threatening or even fatal if not recognized. Other adverse effects include skin rashes, thrombophlebitis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, elevation of liver enzymes, and nephrotoxicity. Impaired renal function has been seen in 24% of patients receiving the drug, but this is usually reversible.",

As a potential anti-inflammatory agent ... topically applied pentamidine reduces ear swelling in the contact hypersensitivity reaction to oxazolone in B6C3F1 mice. The application of pentamidine must occur within 1 hr, at the challenge site, to be effective. Topical application appears necessary, because IV injection had no effect on reduction of ear swelling. In dose-response studies, a 50% reduction in ear swelling was achieved with as little as 20 ug of pentamidine. Pentamidine did not affect Ag transport from the challenge site to the draining lymph nodes, as measured by FITC transport. However, there was a 30 to 40% reduction in epidermal cells expressing Ia Ag from pentamidine-treated mouse ears, compared with control. Ia expression is almost exclusively limited to Langerhans cells in the normal epidermis. This reduction in Ia expression was not due to simple depletion of Langerhans cells by pentamidine, because CD45 expression was unaffected. Concurrent with reduced Ia expression, Ag presentation by pentamidine-treated Langerhans cells was also reduced. ...",

In otherwise intact rats, 7.5 mg/day pentamidine was well tolerated whereas doses of 15 mg/day induced severe, relapsing and eventually lethal hypoglycaemia within a few days. Induction of a renal insufficiency of graded severity by treatment with gentamycin, subtotal nephrectomy and total bilateral nephrectomy resulted in repetitive, severe (sometimes lethal) hypoglycemia, alternating with hyperglycemia, glucosuria and ketonuria in pentamidine-treated rats (7.5 mg/d). No long-standing insulin-dependent diabetes was observed. In the dysglycemic animals, plasma insulin levels were inappropriate to the concomitant glycaemia; no stimulation was obtained by i.v. glucose. Glucagon levels were higher than normal, suppressible by i.v. glucose, responsive to i.v. arginine and to hypoglycemia. Dysglycemic events were more frequent and marked in the rats with the most severe renal functional derangement. They were more frequent in the rats treated with pentamidine mesylate than in those treated with the isethionate salt. Control uremic rats (free of pentamidine) remained euglycemic. The islets of Langerhans displayed severe vascular congestion and degranulation and necrosis of the B cells, while the non B cells (and particularly the A cells) were intact. Exocrine pancreatitis was occasionally observed in the most severely uremic rats. In contrast with uremic rats, neither surgical ligation of choledocus, nor treatment by P450 cytochrome inhibitors (particularly ketoconazole) precipitated dysglycemia in the pentamidine-treated rats. These experimental data: 1) strengthen the concept of inappropriate insulin release from pentamidine-lesioned islet B cells due to pentamidine accumulation; 2) indicate a predominant role for renal insufficiency in determining the accumulation of this drug; 3) emphasize the clinical importance of renal insufficiency as a risk factor for pentamidine-induced dysglycemia.",

Rats in the highest dose group in the subchronic evaluation exhibited decreased body weight gains and reduced lung-with-trachea-to-body weight ratios relative to controls. Hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis values were within normal ranges. Microscopic pulmonary tissue changes were similar to those found in acute exposure with certain lesions (e.g., mucous cell hyperplasia) suggestive of a more chronic process. In addition, lung fibrosis was seen at the highest dose. ...",

It has found increasing usefulness in the treatment of pneumocystosis. Pentamidine isethionate has been effective in treating AIDS patients for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. It is for this reason that it was selected for immunotoxicity studies. The objective of this study was to determine if pentamidine isethionate, administered subcutaneously, altered the immune status. NTP Tier I & selected Tier II assays were performed. Female C57Bl/6 mice were treated with 10, 17 or 25 mg/kg pentamidine isethionate for 5 days a week for four weeks by the subcutaneous route. Since pentamidine isethionate accumulates in the tissues and appears in the urine for six to eight weeks after cessation of therapy, the lymphoid organs were most likely to be continuously exposed to the drug. Since the immune system is targeted by the HIV virus and because antiviral therapy is being used after detection of antibody to HIV, detecting and understanding potential actions on the immune system is important. The objective of this study was to determine the potential of pentamidine isethionate to compromise the immune system. Pentamidine isethionate was administered by the subcutaneous injection daily for 5 days per week for 4 weeks. The studies were divided into standard toxicology studies, which provided the base against which to compare the immunology studies, and the immunology studies, which provided data on specific cellular targets of the drug. Executive Summary Table 1 (ES-1) shows a summary of the standard toxicology studies. Treatment with pentamidine isethionate in doses as high as 25 mg/kg/day for 22 days over a 30 day period were tolerated by adult female C57Bl/6 mice. There was less than 1% mortality from exposure and no overt signs of toxicity. There were no histopathologic findings in the lung, mesenteric lymph node, spleen, thymus, liver or kidney that could be attributed to pentamidine isethionate treatment. Body weight changes associated with pentamidine isethionate treatment were minimal. As expected, the comparative control, azathioprine, produced a significant weight loss from exposure to 10 mg/kg/day for 30 days. Two organs were affected by exposure to the high dose (25 mg/kg) of pentamidine isethionate. These included a 13% decrease in thymus weight and a 9% increase in kidney weight. Pentamidine isethionate treatment was associated with a decrease in the erythroid elements as seen in decreases in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. The leukocyte elements were not significantly affected by pentamidine isethionate treatment. Bone marrow cellularity, DNA synthetic ability, and the number of CFU-M and CFU-GM stem cells were unaffected by treatment with pentamidine isethionate. Azathioprine produced the expected decrease in cellularity and number of stem cells with a concomitant compensatory increase in DNA synthesis. The no effect level for the standard toxicological parameters was not reached. Pentamidine isethionate affected the erythrocyte number at the lowest dose (10 mg/kg) tested. Executive Summary Table 2 (ES-2) summarizes the immunology studies of mice treated with pentamidine isethionate. Treatment of mice with pentamidine isethionate produced no effects on indicators of humoral immunity, such as changes in B cell number, proliferative ability or ability to differentiate into antibody producing cells to a T-dependent antigen. T lymphocyte numbers were slightly decreased in pentamidine isethionate-treated mice but the decrease did not translate into functional changes. Spleen cell response to the T-dependent antigen was unaffected, indicating the regulatory T cells were similar to those from control mice. Proliferative capacity, as measured by response to T cell mitogens and to allogenic cells, was unaffected by pentamidine isethionate treatment. Differentiation and the killing mechanism of T cells were intact in mice treated with pentamidine isethionate as seen in a CTL response which did not differ from the control group. Macrophages, derived from the peritoneal cavity of mice treated with pentamidine isethionate, were more responsive to activation by gamma interferon than control mice which may be a response to the local granuloma produced at the injection site. Natural killer cell activity was unaffected by pentamidine isethionate treatment.  The no effect level for these studies was below 10 mg/kg and the erythroid elements were one of the most sensitive parameters. The immune system is not a target for toxicity by pentamidine isethionate.",

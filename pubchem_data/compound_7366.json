When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A structure/activity relation study shows the t-butyl group on the benzene ring as being the major determinant of ip 2-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenol toxicity. Contractile activity, elicited by field electrical stimulation, acetylcholine or Ba2+, of the ileum longitudinal muscle preparation from 2-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenol-treated rats was greatly reduced 30 min after ip injection, and almost absent during the subsequent 48 hr. Electron-microscope examination of ileum longitudinal muscle also showed partial destruction of cell membranes 4 hr after 2-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenol administration with subsequent mitochondrial swelling and destruction of cristae. myofibrillar fragmentation and cell necrosis. Comparable suppression of contractile activity and morphological damage were observed in 2-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenol or t-butylbenzene incubated ileum segments where longitudinal smooth muscle contractility was irreversibly depressed in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These convergent findings point to the toxic effect of ip 2-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenol on gut musculature with consequent impairment of intestinal transit.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.20 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates t-butylbenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase t-butylbenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 days. If released to soil, t-butylbenzene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1181. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.32X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. t-Butylbenzene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Biodegradation from soil may occur based on activated sludge study results. If released into water, t-butylbenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation from water may occur, although volatilzation could not be ruled out. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hr and 4 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 291 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to t-butylbenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where t-butylbenzene is produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase t-butylbenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.60X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3).",

An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that t-butylbenzene is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 1 hr(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is 8 days if adsorption is considered(4). t-Butylbenzene's estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of t-butylbenzene from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 2.20 mm Hg(1).",

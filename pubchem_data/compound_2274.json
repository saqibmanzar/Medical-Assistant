When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Aztreonam exhibits potent and specific activity in vitro against a wide spectrum of gram-negative aerobic pathogens including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. It has no useful activity against gram-positive bacteria or anaerobes, but has very broad spectrum against gram-negative aerobes, including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. This has given it the nickname \"the magic bullet for aerobic gram-negative bacteria\". Aztreonam, unlike the majority of beta-lactam antibiotics, does not induce beta-lactamase activity and its molecular structure confers a high degree of resistance to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases (such as penicillinases and cephalosporinases) produced by most gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens; it is, therefore, usually active against gram-negative aerobic microorganisms that are resistant to antibiotics hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases. It is active against many strains that are multiply-resistant to other antibiotics, such as certain cephalosporins, penicillin, and aminoglycosides. Aztreonam maintains its antimicrobial activity over a pH range of 6 to 8 in vitro, as well as in the presence of human serum and under anaerobic conditions.",

Asymptomatic serum aminotransferase elevations are common during high dose, intravenous aztreonam therapy (10% to 38%). The enzyme abnormalities are usually mild-to-moderate, asymptomatic, self-limited and not requiring drug discontinuation. Enzyme elevations occur slightly more commonly during aztreonam therapy than with other comparative antibiotics. Cases of frank liver injury and jaundice attributable to aztreonam must be extremely rare as no individual cases have been reported. For this reason, there is no data regarding the latency or pattern of the injury. Instances of marked aminotransferase elevations within 3 to 5 days of starting aztreonam have been reported, but these cases were without jaundice and resolved rapidly once the drug was stopped.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

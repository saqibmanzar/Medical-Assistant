When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3.

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Oral, esophageal, and stomach burns are common. Vomitus generally has a coffee-ground appearance. The potential for circulatory collapse is high following ingestion of trichloroethylsilane. Acute inhalation exposure may result in sneezing, choking, laryngitis, dyspnea (shortness of breath), respiratory tract irritation, and chest pain. Bleeding of nose and gums, ulceration of the nasal and oral mucosa, pulmonary edema, chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia may also occur. Renal toxicity has been observed in animals. If the eyes have come in contact with trichloroethylsilane, then irritation, pain (may be delayed in the case of vapor exposure), swelling, corneal erosion, and blindness may result. Severe burns, pain, shock, and dermatitis (red, inflamed skin) generally follow dermal exposure.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Higher exposure can cause pulmonary edema, a medical emergency that can be delayed for several hours. This can cause death. Bleeding of nose and gums, ulceration of the nasal and oral mucosa, pulmonary edema, chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia may also occur. If the eyes have come in contact with dimethyldichlorosilane, irritation, pain, swelling, corneal erosion, and blindness may result. Dermatitis (red, inflamed skin), severe burns, pain, and shock generally follow dermal exposure. Inhalation irritates mucous membranes. Severe gastrointestinal damage may occur. Vapors cause severe eye and lung injury. Upon short contact, second and third degree burns may occur. Signs and symptoms of acute ingestion of dimethyldichlorosilane may be severe and include increased salivation, intense thirst, difficulty swallowing, chills, pain, and shock. Oral, esophageal, and stomach burns are common. /Dimethyldichlorosilane/",

These data suggest that the acute toxicity of chlorosilanes is due to the hydrogen chloride hydrolysis product; acute toxicity of the chlorosilanes is both qualitatively (based on clinical signs) and quantitatively (based on molar equivalents of hydrogen chloride) similar to that of HCl. Complete hydrolysis of one mole of a monochlorosilane would yield a maximum of one mole of hydrogen chloride. Complete hydrolysis of a dichlorosilane would yield a maximum of two moles of hydrogen chloride, complete hydrolysis of a trichlorosilane would yield a maximum of three moles of hydrogen chloride, and complete hydrolysis of tetrachlorosilane would yield a maximum of four moles of hydrogen chloride. /Chorosilanes/",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this crystalline material may occur from its use as a chemical intermediate for the synthesis of riboflavin (vitamin B2). Contact with 3,4-xylidine may cause burns to the skin and eyes. Death is also a possible outcome from exposure. While the OSHA PEL is set at a TWA of 5 ppm, the ACGIH lists xylidine (mixed isomers) on its 1988-1989 Notice of Intended Changes with a proposed TLV of 0.5 ppm, and a designation of \"suspected human carcinogen\". In activities or situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus, and full chemical protective clothing which is specifically recommended by the shipper or manufacturer to prevent skin contact with xylidine. If contact should occur, immediately flush the affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. Do not eat or smoke in xylidine work areas. While xylidine does not ignite easily, it can burn with the production of irritating or poisonous gases. Also, containers may explode violently in the heat of a fire. Fires involving xylidine may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, or standard foam. Water spray if used, should be applied with caution because it may cause frothing. Fight the fire from a maximum distance and dike runoff from fire control water. Xylidine should be stored away from heat, strong oxidizers, and hypochlorite bleaches. Shipping regulations and other DOT regulatory requirements should be consulted before transport. If 3,4-xylidine should spill, carefully shovel the material into clean covered containers (solutions are first diked far ahead, then taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent) for later disposal. Incineration is a possible form of disposal for xylidine. Before implementing land disposal of waste 3,4-xylidine, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

If released to the atmosphere, 3,4-xylidine should exist mainly in the vapor phase based on a measured vapor pressure of 0.028 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 3,4-xylidine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 2 hours. An estimated Koc value of 240 suggests that 3,4-xylidine may have moderate mobility in soil. However, anilines are expected to bind stongly to humus or soil organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group; therefore, mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization of 3,4-xylidine may be important from moist soil surfaces given a measured Henry's Law constant of 1.77X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Based on limited aqueous screening data, 3,4-xylidine is expected to aerobically biodegrade in both soil and water. 3,4-Xylidine reached 7.1% of the theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum. In water, 3,4-xylidine may strongly adsorb to suspended organic matter in the water column based on its structure (an aromatic amine). 3,4-Xylidine is expected to volatilize from water surfaces given its measured Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 21 days, respectively, although this may be attenuated by adsorption to organic material. The potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is expected to be low based on BCF values ranging from 1.9 to <10, measured in carp. Exposure to 3,4-xylidine may occur occupationally during its production or subsequent use. The general population may be exposed through dermal contact with products containing this compound and inhalation of tobacco smoke. (SRC)",

However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or soil organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). Volatilization of 3,4-xylidine may be important from moist soil surfaces(SRC) given a measured Henry's Law constant of 1.85X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(2). Based on limited aqueous screening study data, 3,4-xylidine may biodegrade under aerobic conditions in soil(SRC); 3,4-xylidine, present at 30 mg/l, reached 7.1% of the theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(6).",

However, aromatic amine groups are recognized as having a strong affinity to organic carbon, suggesting that this compound may bind strongly to suspended organic material in water(3,4). 3,4-Xylidine may volatilize from water surfaces(1,SRC) based on a measured Henry's Law constant of 1.85X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(2). Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 21 days, respectively(1,SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), measured BCF values of 1.9-3.3 and <10(6), measured in carp, suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Based on limited aqueous screening study data, 3,4-xylidine may biodegrade slowly under aerobic conditions in water(SRC); 3,4-xylidine, present at 30 mg/l, reached 7.1% of the theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

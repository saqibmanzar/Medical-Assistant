PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

To better understand the species differences in the pharmacokinetics of macrolide antibiotics, the disposition of erythromycin, oleandomycin, and tylosin in several mammalian species was examined. Generally, the serum concentration versus time profiles of these drugs after intravenous administration were described by two-compartment kinetic models and were similar within each species. These drugs were rapidly cleared, resulting in terminal half-lives of less than 2 h. Comparison of their pharmacokinetics showed greater variation in antibiotic disposition among animal species than noted for the differences within a species. When the pharmacokinetic data was fitted to an allometric model, the logarithms of volume of distribution, clearance, and half-life were linearly related to the logarithms of body weight. From these relationships, the human pharmacokinetics of erythromycin and oleandomycin were extrapolated and found to approximate observed human pharmacokinetics.",

The grade of synergism was expressed by the synergistic ratio (SR), a ratio of experimentally determined potency of the combined drug over a hypothetical potency in which additive effect of the both drugs is assumed. With 3 out of the 4 strains of S. aureus synergism between TC and OM or triacetyloleandomycin (TAO) was demonstrated by the determination of the 50% effective dose and by statistical examination of the SR. The grade of synergistic protection by these drugs varied with the strains infected and it did not depend upon the sensitivity to antibiotics or grade of synergism in vitro. There was no synergistic enhancement of acute toxic action in the combined administration of TC and OM to mice.",

All the antibiotics, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, gentamicin, oleandomycin and phosphonomycin induced forward mutation to L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid resistance in Escherichia coli WP2. This response was closely correlated with the toxic effects and was inferred to be deletion mutation. In addition, chloramphenicol was weakly active in reversion of the frame-shift mutation in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, gentamicin caused petite induction in S. cerevisiae at pH 4.4--4.7 and tetracycline gave a significant response with gene conversion and petite induction also in S. cerevisiae but at pH 7.2. The results, particularly those with E. coli, cast doubts on the validity of testing specifically designed antibacterial agents in bacteria, and raise serious problems in the evaluation of such data in terms to human populations.",

Oleandomycin is produced by Streptomyces antibioticus. Oleandomycin absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm (UV max = 286-289 nm) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, oleandomycin is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. The pKa of oleandomycin is 8.84, indicating that this compound will exist primarily as a cation in the environment, and cations generally have lower mobility in soils than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because cations do not volatilize. Oleandomycin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available for oleandomycin. If released into water, oleandomycin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Adsorption may be stronger than this Koc value suggests since cations generally adsorb to sediments more strongly than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because cations do not volatilize. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Oleandomycin contains hydrolyzable functional groups and therefore may undergo hydrolysis in the environment; however, a rate constant could not be estimated for this structure. Occupational exposure to oleandomycin may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where oleandomycin is produced or used. Exposure to oleandomycin among the general population may be limited to those who administer this substance to animals. (SRC)",

A pKa of 8.84 (tertiary amine)(2) indicates that this compound will exist primarily as a cation in the environment and cations generally adsorb to sediment more strongly than their neutral counterparts(4). Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(SRC) because cations do not volatilize.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

All solvents were tested in their pure form and with 70% acetone. For all solvents tested the lag time was <2 hr, and for the majority of them was about 60 min. Flux at steady state ranged between 0.017 +/- 0.005 and 3.435 +/- 1.897 mg/sq cm/hr and permeation rate was from 0.0192 to 1.02 x 10-3 cm/hr.

Epidemiological studies of  semiconductor populations evaluated potential adverse reproductive outcomes. ...  In each of these studies, workers were exposed to mixtures including diglyme but not to diglyme alone. ...  Exposure to EGEs was determined using questionnaires from subjects about the work performed and an assessment of the work environment by industrial hygienists, but no measurements of personal or area exposures were made. Workers in the fabrication area were considered exposed to EGEs. For the retrospective study, information on pregnancy outcomes and potential confounders (age, smoking, ethnicity, education, income, year of pregnancy, and stress) was obtained through a comprehensive interviewer-administered interview of female employees. The prospective study of early fetal loss and fecundity (probability of conception per menstrual cycle) was conducted in a subset of female employees from five plants. Daily diaries and measurements of daily urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels for 6 months were collected in addition to the comprehensive interview. Of the 891 medically verified pregnancies identified for the retrospective study, 774 (86.9%) were live births, 113 (12.7%) were spontaneous abortions, and 4 (0.4%) were stillbirths. The overall unadjusted relative risk (RR) for spontaneous abortions was 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-2.05) and changed little after adjusting for confounders (adjusted RR =1.43; 95% CI = 0.95-2.09). When stratified by work group, the risk of spontaneous abortion was statistically significantly increased for female workers in the photolithography group (RR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.04-2.55) and in the etching group (RR = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.27-3.19). For women working with higher levels of EGE only in masking, the risk for spontaneous abortion was increased 3-fold (RR = 3.38; 95% CI = 1.61-5.73). In the prospective study, no statistically significant differences were detected in the overall rate of spontaneous abortions between fabrication and non-fabrication workers or when pregnancy outcomes were examined by work group. However, the ability to conceive was lower among female workers exposed to EGEs (fertility rate [FR] = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.11-1.19). /Ethylene glycol ethers/",

Diethylene glycol diethyl ether was administered daily in distilled water by gavage at 0, 300, 1,500, 3,000 and 4,500 mg/kg on gestational days (gd) 6 through 15. Maternal toxicity was evident in dams exposed to diethylene glycol diethyl ether at doses greater than or equal to 1,500 mg/kg/day . CNS function was highly sensitive to treatment as evidenced by ataxia, coma and lethargy in a majority of the dams dosed. Mortality among confirmed--pregnant animals occurred with incidences of 0% (0/29), 0% (0/24), 8.6% (3/35), 11.8% (4/34) and 100% (14/14) in the control through high-dose groups, respectively. Deaths occurred early during the dosing period (gd 6-9), and all deaths at the high dose were preceded by evidence of severe CNS depression. There were no effects of treatment on any of the parameters that indicate changes in the numbers of resorptions, nonlive implants, fetal deaths as well as live fetuses. Average fetal body weight per litter was significantly lower at 3,000 mg/kg diethylene glycol diethyl ether when compared with the control group. The incidence of major malformations was low in all groups and was dose independent. The 1,500 mg/kg/day dose was a no observed effect level (NOEL) for developmental toxicity. In conclusion, development of the CD-1 mouse is not sensitive to diethylene glycol diethyl ether administered by gavage at maternally nontoxic doses. A NOEL for diethylene glycol diethyl ether-induced developmental toxicity was 1,500 mg/kg/day, a dose which produced maternal CNS depression and lethality (8.6%). The lowest dose given, 300 mg/kg/day, represented a NOEL for diethylene glycol diethyl ether-induced maternal toxicity.",

Diethylene glycol diethyl ether was dissolved in distilled water to provide doses of 0, 50, 200 and 400 mg/kg, and subsequently administered daily by gavage from gestational days (gd) 6 through 19. DGDE treatment did not adversely influence maternal viability. The only exception was that one of the 27 confirmed pregnant dams (3.7%) in the 400 mg/kg group died on gd 15. Necropsy of that animal indicated that its death was related to diethylene glycol diethyl ether exposure. The pregnancy incidence was similar across dose groups and ranged from 85.7% to 88.6%. Clinical signs of toxicity were observed during treatment with the greatest occurrence in the high dose group. Ataxia, coma, dyspnea and postdosing vocalization predominated at 400 mg diethylene glycol diethyl ether/kg/day. Weight loss (greater than or equal to 150 g/day) occurred in both the control and treated animals. Maternal body weight was similar among dose groups on gd 0 as well as throughout the treatment and post-treatment periods. When weight gain was compared, however, dams exposed to 400 mg diethylene glycol diethyl ether/kg had significantly lower weight gain than controls during the treatment period. Liver and gravid uterine weights did not differ among dose groups. There was no effect of treatment on embryo viability. The incidences of resorptions and fetal deaths were similar among the treatment groups. In addition, the number of live fetuses per litter and average fetal body weight per litter (both sexes) were not affected by diethylene glycol diethyl ether treatment. Nonetheless. when fetal body weights were analyzed by sex, female weight manifested a significant decreasing trend which was related to the statistically nonsignificant, weight reduction in the 400 mg/kg/day dose group, In addition, embryo/fetal morphogenesis was not observably altered by diethylene glycol diethyl ether treatment, based on the findings of external, visceral and skeletal examinations of gd 30 fetuses. In conclusion, embryonic and fetal development of the NZW rabbit was not sensitive to diethylene glycol diethyl ether as tested in the present study at maternally toxic doses. Although clearcut developmental effects were not identified for diethylene glycol diethyl ether, the significant decreasing trend in body weight of female fetuses at 400 mg/kg/day is marginal evidence of diethylene glycol diethyl ether-induced developmental toxicity. Since maternal toxicity was also observed at the high dose, the 200 mg/kg/day dose represents a no observed effect level (NOEL) for both diethylene glycol diethyl ether induced developmental and maternal toxicities.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.52 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diethylene glycol diethyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diethylene glycol diethyl ether  will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 hours. If released to soil, diethylene glycol diethyl ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 39. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Diethylene glycol diethyl ether may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation of diethylene glycol diethyl ether is not expected to be an important fate process in soil or water based on biodegradation studies conducted with sewage seed. If released into water, diethylene glycol diethyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to diethylene glycol diethyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diethylene glycol diethyl ether is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to diethylene glycol diethyl ether via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing diethylene glycol diethyl ether.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

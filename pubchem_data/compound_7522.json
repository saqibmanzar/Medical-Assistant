The IR spectra tells you what types of vibrational mode (motion) responses occur in a molecule interacting with infrared light.  It is used to help determine the functional groups in a molecule.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-pyridinecarbonitrile will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-pyridinecarbonitrile will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 246 days. If released to soil, 2-pyridinecarbonitrile is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 42. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.89X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, 2-pyridinecarbonitrile is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The half-life for 2-pyridinecarbonitrile in an anoxic sediment slurry was 16.5 hrs based in a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 1.01 per day, which suggests that 2-pyridinecarbonitrile may biodegrade in the environment under anaerobic conditions. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Chemical hydrolysis is expected to occur slowly in the environment. Occupational exposure to 2-pyridinecarbonitrile may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-pyridinecarbonitrile is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of 2-pyridinecarbonitrile from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.89X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(4). 2-Pyridinecarbonitrile is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 0.5 mm Hg(SRC), determined from its estimated water solubility, 25,500 mg/l(5), and estimated Henry's law constant(4). In water, the half-life for 2-pyridinecarbonitrile in an anoxic sediment from the Tansui River (Taiwan) was 16.5 hrs based in a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 1.01 per day(6); this suggests that 2-pyridinecarbonitrile may biodegrade in soil under anaerobic conditions(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.89X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). The half-life for 2-pyridinecarbonitrile in an anoxic sediment from the Tansui River (Taiwan) was 16.5 hrs based in a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 1.01 per day(7), which suggests that 2-pyridinecarbonitrile may biodegrade in the environment under anaerobic conditions(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

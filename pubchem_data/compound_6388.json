PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Exposure to this colorless, nearly odorless gas may be occur to the general population through inhalation of freon 142b as a propellant in aerosol sprays, and to workers through inhalation or dermal contact during the manufacture, use, servicing, and disposal of refrigeration units, food processing, plastic foam blowing, and fire extinguishing, among others. Inhalation of freon 142b may cause dizziness and suffocation, while dermal contact may cause defatting of skin and frostbite. Sufficient exhaust and general ventilation should be provided to keep vapor concentration below recommended levels (a threshold limit of about 500 ppm for repeated workday exposure was suggested). Also, wear appropriate chemical protective gloves and goggles, and in emergency situations such as spills or fire fighting wear a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing. Freon 142b is extremely flammable. Atmospheres of freon in the range of 6.2% to 17.9% in air can ignite explosively when contacted by heat, sparks, or flames. Freon 142b may travel to a source of ignition and flash back. Also, freon vapor, in confined spaces presents an explosion hazard. When leaking containers of freon (including tank cars, tank trucks, and storage tanks) are on fire, let them burn unless the flow can be stopped. From as far a distance as possible, use water spray to knock down vapor and to cool fire-exposed containers. To fight small freon 142b fires, use dry chemical or CO2, and for large fires use water spray, fog, or foam. For uncontrollable fires or the pssibility of container eruption, consider evacuation of 1/2 mile radius and the use of unmanned hose holders. When heated to decomposition, this substance emits toxic fumes of fluoride and chloride as well as small amounts of phosgene. Fire fighters should wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing. Store and use freon 142b cylinders in well ventilated areas away from heat, all ignition sources, and all highly oxidizing and flammable materials. Freon 142b should be in DOT-approved, low pressure cylinders, equipped with brass valves. Containers may be shipped via road, and water (forbidden on passenger and aircraft or railcar), and should be affixed with labels stating, \"Flammable Gas\". Before transporting freon 142b, the regulatory requirements of the DOT should be consulted. If freon 142b spills or leaks, shut off ignition sources (eg, no flares or smoking), stop leak if it can be done without risk (do not touch the material), and isolate the area. Water spray may be used to reduce the vapor, but care is needed to prevent the material from entering water sources or sewers. Consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance on acceptable disposal practices.",

Explosive limits specify the concentration range of a material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an ignition source. There are two types of explosive limits: lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL). The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. CAUTION: For LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972), DO NOT apply water, regular or alcohol-resistant foam directly on spill. Use a high-expansion foam if available to reduce vapors. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2024)",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Inhalation of high concentrations induced signs of lung irritation and Central Nervous System depressing effects of anesthetic type in rats and cardiac sensitisation in dogs. Consequently, 1-chloro 1,1 -difloroethane may be hazardous to humans in case of accidental exposure to high concentrations occurring in confined area where replacement of air by the gas could at the same time reduce oxygen in the atmosphere. In repeated inhalation exposure studies, 1-chloro -1,1- difluoroethane did not induce specific chronic toxicity in rats and dogs exposed 6 hr/d, 5 d/week during several months (no target organs identified ; the no observed adverse effects were higher than 41,000 mg/cum (10,000 ppm) in dogs exposed during 3 months and higher than 82,000 mg/cum (20,000 ppm) in rats exposed for their lifetime). There was no carcinogenic effect in rats exposed for their life time (6hr/d, 5d/week at concentrations up to 82,000 mg/cum (20,000 ppm)). In genotoxicity studies, 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane was mutagenic in vitro on bacteria (Ames test) and gave equivocal results in a cell neoplastic transformation assay. However, in in vivo mutagenicity studies it was inactive (in a Dominant lethal assay and in a Bone Marrow cytogenetic assay in rats exposed by inhalation du ring 15 and 13 weeks respectively). Overall, these results suggest that 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane does not pose a significant genotoxic hazard to humans. In the reproduction field, 1-chloro 1,1-difluoroethane did not induce adverse effect on fertility of male mice exposed up to 82,000 mg/cum (20,000 ppm) (in a Dominant lethal assay) and did not induce male and female lesions of sexual organs in rats and dogs exposed for several months. Also the gas did not induce teratogenic or embryo/foetotoxicity effect and no maternal toxicity in two inhalation developmental toxicity studies where rats were exposed during pregnancy up to 41,000 mg/cum (10,000 ppm). Environment: Based on its physico-chemical properties, the air compartment is the preferred target one for 1-chloro -1,1- difluoroethane. The global atmospheric lifetime of 142b is 18.5 years corresponding to a 1/2 -lifetime of 12.8 years. The tropospheric lifetime due to removal by reaction with OH is 19.5 years. Atmospheric degradation products are essentially the aldehyde form of 142b which further degrade to form CF2(=O) which will hydrolyze in atmospheric water to form HF (also in the OECD HPV Chemicals Programme) and CO2. The ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 1-chloro -1,1-difluoroethane is the main concern of this substance. Due to its ODP value of 0.065, it is considered as an ozone depleting substance. The calculated Global Warming Potential of 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane is 1800 for an integration horizon of 100 years. Its contribution to the Greenhouse effect is small i.e. 0.00108 W/sq m. In water, 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane is not readily biodegradable under aerobic condition (about 5 % of biodegradation after 28 days). It is not expected to bioaccumulate (log Kow = 1.64 - 2.05). 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane has a low acute toxicity to fish and daphnia. The lowest available LC50 being higher than 100 mg/L. No acute toxicity tests are available for algae. Algae appear to be more sensitive than fish and daphnids to 1-chloro1,1-difluoroethane with a calculated 96h EC50 of 45 mg/L. Exposure: The expected production volume of 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane in year 2000 is 36,000 tonnes in Europe, 42,000 tonnes in the USA and an amount of 84,000 tonnes for the total world. Its main uses are as a chemical intermediate to produce fluoropolymers and as a blowing agent. A small portion is used as a component of refrigerant fluids. The production and consumption of 1-chloro1,1-difluoroethane are covered by the Montreal Protocol. In the case of developed countries, a phase-out of 1-chloro1,1-difluoroethane and other hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) is scheduled as follows: 35% in 2004, 65% in 2010, 90% in 2015, 99.5% in 2020. A total phase-out is scheduled in 2030. For developing countries, a freeze of the production is scheduled in 2016 and a total phase-out in 2040. In the European Union, the phase-out of ozone depleting substances is scheduled more rapidly than that required by the Montreal protocol. The total ban of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) is required on January 1, 2010, the use as blowing agent for expended polystyrene being prohibited from January 1, 2002.",

Inhaled fluorocarbons sensitize the myocardium to catecholamines, frequently resulting in lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Because they are gases heavier than air, fluorocarbons can displace atmospheric oxygen, thus resulting in asphyxiation. These compounds also have a central nervous system anesthetic effect analogous to a structurally similar general anesthetic, halothane. Pressurized refrigerant or liquid fluorocarbons with a low boiling point have a cryogenic effect on exposed tissues, causing frostbite, laryngeal or pulmonary edema, and gastrointestinal perforation. /Freons/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2,540 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 years. In the stratosphere, 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane may slowly photolyze, producing chlorine atoms which in turn would participate in the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone, or it may slowly react with singlet oxygen. If released to soil, 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 40. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.0588 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Chloro-1,1-difluoroethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 1-Chloro-1,1-difluoroethane is not expected to biodegrade in soil or water based upon studies with sewage sludge and pure cultures. If released into water, 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 10 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 1-Chloro-1,1-difluoroethane showed no alkaline reaction and a half-life of 16,000 years in neutral reactions; therefore, hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process. Occupational exposure to 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane via ambient air. (SRC)",

According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 10(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.05(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 1-Chloro-1,1-difluoroethane showed no alkaline reaction and a half-life of 16,000 years in neutral reactions(8). 1-Chloro-1,1-difluoroethane did not biodegrade in sewage sludge(9) nor in pure culture extracts(10).",

Gas-phase 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 years(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.06X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). In the stratosphere, 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane may slowly photolyze, producing chlorine atoms which in turn would participate in the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone, or it may slowly react with singlet oxygen(4). Removal of 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane in clouds due to hydrolysis is expected to be slow(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 14 years at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The alkaline hydrolysis rate constant in sodium hydroxide solutions ranging from 0.1 to 0.001 M and the neutral hydrolysis rate constant in solutions of 0.01 M hydrochloric acid were determined for 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane; results showed no alkaline reaction and a half-life of 16,000 years in neutral reactions(2). This suggests that hydrolysis will not be an important fate process(SRC). Removal of 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane in clouds due to hydrolysis is expected to be slow(3). In the stratosphere, 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane may slowly photolyze, producing chlorine atoms which in turn would participate in the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone, or it may slowly react with singlet oxygen(4). 1-Chloro-1,1-difluoroethane will partition predominantly to the atmosphere on release to the environment, provided it does not enter a confined ecosystem such as groundwater(5). 1-Chloro-1,1-difluoroethane has estimated atmospheric life-time of 215 to 220 years(6). Degradation products include chlorodifluoro acetaldehyde, carbonic difluoride, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide(7).",

Stored air samples collected at Cape Grim, Tasmania from 1978 to 1993 were analyzed to investigate the change in tropospheric concn of 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane. Using these data, a 2-dimensional model was utilized to generate an atmospheric lifetime for 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane of 15.5 years, a lifetime of 17.4 years due to reaction with hydroxyl radicals (OH concn of 6.5X10+5 molec/cu-m), and a stratospheric lifetime of 140 years(2). The ozone depletion potential for 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane, using a 1-dimensional and a 2-dimensional model and a methyl chloroform lifetime of 6.3 years, was determined to range from 0.047 to 0.062; the calculated model half-life of 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane was determined to range from 15.1 to 28 years(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

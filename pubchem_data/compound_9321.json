With 2,4-pentanedione, it condenses to give the 3,5-dimethylpyrazole. In the Einhorn-Brunner reaction hydrazines react with imides to give triazoles. Hydrazine is a convenient reductant because the by-products are typically nitrogen gas and water. Thus, it is used as an antioxidant, an oxygen scavenger, and a corrosion inhibitor in water boilers and heating systems. It is also used to reduce metal salts and oxides to the pure metals in electroless nickel plating and plutonium extraction from nuclear reactor waste. Hydrazine is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula N2H4. It is a colourless liquid with an ammonia-like odor and is derived from the same industrial chemistry processes that manufacture ammonia. However, hydrazine has physical properties that are more similar to those of water. The propanone azine is an intermediate in the Atofina-PCUK synthesis. Direct alkylation of hydrazines with alkyl halides in the presence of base affords alkyl-substituted hydrazines, but the reaction is typically inefficient due to poor control on level of substitution (same as in ordinary amines). The reduction of hydrazones to hydrazines present a clean way to produce 1,1-dialkylated hydrazines.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Once in the blood, they are probably carried to all the tissues of the body. Soon after exposure, the levels of hydrazines in the tissues fall since they are metabolised in several products such as acetyl-, diacetylhydrazine, pyruvate hydrazone, urea, and acyclic compound (1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxo-3-pyridazine carboxylic acid). However, these metabolites interacts with some important proteins and might be harmful to the body. Some studies showed that metabolites and unchanged hydrazine leave the body within one day. \nSmall amounts can also be found in the expired air. (L154, A112)",

A low temperature is used to prevent decomposition and chlorate formation, and the excess of sodium hydroxide is kept at a low level. The sodium hypochlorite solution is mixed with a threefold excess of ammonia at 5 \u00b0C to form chloramine, which is then rapidly added to a 30-fold molar excess of anhydrous ammonia under pressure (20-30 MPa) and heated to 130 \u00b0C. The reaction liquor containing 1-2% hydrazine hydrate, is treated as in the conventional Raschig process to give hydrazine hydrate. Anhydrous hydrazine is obtained by removing the water by azeotropic distillation with aniline in a column at atmospheric pressure. Condensation of the vapor yields a two-layer distillate; the aqueous phase is removed and the aniline phase refluxed to the top of the column. Anhydrous hydrazine is recovered as a mixture with aniline, from which it is separated by distillation.",

Sodium hypochlorite, acetone, and a 20% aqueous solution of ammonia (molar ratio 1:2:20, respectively) are fed simultaneously and continuously into a reactor at about 35 \u00b0C and 200 kPa. Excess ammonia is removed from the reaction mixture by stripping, quenched with water, and recycled to the reactor as an aqueous solution. The aqueous dimethyl ketazine solution, freed from ammonia but containing unreacted acetone, sodium chloride, and organic impurities, is fed into a distillation column where the dimethyl ketazine is recovered as an aqueous azeotrope (containing 55% dimethyl ketazine; by 95 \u00b0C at 101.3 kPa) at atmospheric pressure. The injection of acetone into the distillation column is claimed to prevent premature hydrolysis of the ketazine. The byproduct from the still is a solution of sodium chloride containing traces of hydrazine and organic compounds. The solution must be treated before disposal or recycling to electrolysis. The dimethyl ketazine is then hydrolyzed in a distillation column under pressure (0.8-1.2 Mpa), giving acetone, which is recycled to the reactor, and a 10% aqueous solution of hydrazine. The latter is then concentrated to a hydrazine content of 64%.",

The reaction is carried out in the presence of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) at atmospheric pressure and 50 \u00b0C. The ratio of H2O2:MEK:NH3 used is 1:2:4. The hydrogen peroxide is activated by acetamide and disodium hydrogen phosphate or by an arsenic compound. The overall reaction results in the formation of methyl ethyl ketazine in high yield. The mechanism requires the activation of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide as these two reactants, unlike ammonia and hypochlorite in the Bayer process, do not react together. The reaction pathway involves the formation of an oxaziridine intermediate that is able to oxidize ammonia to a hydrazine derivative. Since methyl ethyl ketazine is insoluble in the reaction mixture, it is easily separated by decantation; it is then purified by distillation. The purified ketazine is hydrolyzed under pressure (0.8-10 MPa) to give concentrated aqueous hydrazine and overhead methyl ethyl ketone, which is recycled. The aqueous layer containing the activator is concentrated to remove water and recycled to the reactors after a purge of water-soluble impurities.",

In the second step, application of the synthesis nanocomposite describes the preparation of carbon paste electrode modified with N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,5-dinitrobenzamide as a high sensitive and selective voltammetric sensor for determination of hydrazine and phenol in water and wastewater samples. The mediated oxidation of hydrazine at the modified electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Also, the values of catalytic rate constant (k) and diffusion coefficient (D) for hydrazine were calculated. Square wave voltammetry (SWV) of hydrazine at the modified electrode exhibited two linear dynamic ranges with a detection limit (3sigma) of 8.0 nmol/L. SWV was used for simultaneous determination of hydrazine and phenol at the modified electrode and quantitation of hydrazine and phenol in some real samples by the standard addition method.",

The derivatization reactions were easily realized by ultrasonic manipulation for 40min. Good separation of the derivatization products was achieved using a C18 column by gradient elution. The optimized mass transition ion-pairs (m/z) monitored for the two hydrazine derivatives were m/z 237.1 >>> 119.9 and m/z 176.9  >>> 117.8, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for hydrazine were 0.002 and 0.005 ng/mL separately. And they were 0.03 and 0.05 ng/mL for acetylhydrazine, respectively. The linear range was 0.005-50 ng/mL for hydrazine and 0.05-500 ng/mL for acetylhydrazine with R2 greater than 0.999. The recovery range was determined to be 95.38-108.12% with the relative standard deviation (RSD) in the range of 1.24-14.89%. The method was successfully applied to detect 30 clinical plasma samples of pulmonary tuberculosis patients treated with isoniazid. The concentrations were from 0.04-1.99 ng/mL for hydrazine and 0.06-142.43 ng/mL for acetylhydrazine. The results indicated that our developed method had the potential for the detection of hydrazine toxicology in complex biological samples. Furthermore, the method has an important significance to clinical treatment with drugs.",

Lower-level exposures occur in industrial workers or as a result of the use of some pharmaceuticals. A method was developed for the quantitation of hydrazine in human urine and can be extended by dilution with water to cover at least six orders of magnitude, allowing measurement at all clinically significant levels of potential exposure. Urine samples were processed by isotope dilution, filtered, derivatized and then quantified by HPLC-MS-MS. The analytical response ratio was linearly proportional to the urine concentration of hydrazine from 0.0493 to 12.3 ng/mL, with an average correlation coefficient R of 0.9985. Inter-run accuracy for 21 runs, expressed as percent relative error (% RE), was </= 14%, and the corresponding precision, expressed as percent relative standard deviation (% RSD), was </= 15%. Because this method can provide a quantitative measurement of clinical samples over six orders of magnitude, it can be used to monitor trace amounts of hydrazine exposure as well as industrial and environmental exposure levels.",

Selective, rapid, and sensitive detection of hydrazine thus becomes absolutely necessary in both biological and environmental sciences. Accordingly, fluorescence probes for hydrazine have been paid great attention in recent years. Disclosed here is the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probe with a turn-on fluorescent probe CyJ based on the structure-emission property relationships of the NIR dyes containing an acetyl group as the recognizing moiety. This new probe not only can be readily prepared, but also shows excellent sensing properties. First and most important of all, CyJ is highly selective for N2H4 over various anions, cations, and other amino compounds and has a low limit of detection (LOD) of hydrazine (5.4 ppb as fluorescence sensor and 6.1 ppb as UV sensor). Besides, CyJ exhibited a dramatic increase in fluorescence at (lambda)max = 706 nm in the presence of N2H4, and it offers a rapid, colorimetric and vapor sensing detection process for N2H4 in both aqueous solution and diluted human serum. Furthermore, CyJ has good cell-membrane permeability and low cytotoxicity. In addition, we have successfully applied the CyJ to visualize N2H4 in live mouse and, for the first time, in tissues such as the liver, lung, kidney, heart, and spleen.",

This OFF-ON fluorescent probe shows a large (117 nm) red-shifted absorption spectrum and the color changes from colorless to red upon addition of hydrazine in the aqueous solution, which can serve as a \"naked-eye\" probe for hydrazine. Moreover, this probe also shows a significant fluorescence increase (approximately 16 folds) and excellent linear relationship at physiological pH. Utilizing this sensitive and selective probe, we have successfully detected hydrazine in living cells.",

[Frazier, p. 341-2] Hydrazine and hydrazine sulfate are reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens. [NTP] Hydrazines antagonize GABA in the CNS causing excitation and seizures. Pyridoxine, vitamin B6, is a specific antidote for this effect. [AHLS, p. 426] See Carcinogenicity of some industrial chemicals, Volume 115. [IARC, News Release, 23 February 2016]",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Store separately in a corrosion-resistant location. Prior to working with this chemical you should be trained on its proper handling and storage. Before entering confined space where hydrazine may be present, check to make sure that an explosive concentration does not exist. Hydrazine must be stored to avoid contact with oxidizers (such as perchlorates, peroxides, permanganates, chlorates, and nitrates), strong acids (such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, and nitric); hydrogen peroxide, and metal oxides since violent reactions occur. Store in tightly closed containers in a cool, well-ventilated area away from heat. Sources of ignition, such as smoking and open flames, are prohibited where hydrazine is used, handled, or stored in a manner that could create a potential fire or explosion hazard. Wherever hydrazine is used, handled, manufactured, or stored, use explosion-proof electrical equipment and fittings. A regulated, marked area should be established where this chemical is handled, used, or stored in compliance with OSHA Standard 1910.1045.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Forms explosive metal hydrazides when mixed with alkali metals in presence of ammonia [Mellor 8, Supp. 2:95(1967)]. During the measurement of the shock sensitivity of a mixture containing hydrazine, a drop of the mixture fell on a tetryl explosive. The tetryl immediately burst into flames [ASESB 105].

It is used as an oxygen scavenger in boiler water treatment, as an electrodeless nickel coating reagent, and in rocket propellant. It is also used in a variety of other fields including pharmaceuticals, explosives, polymers and polymer additives, antioxidants, metal reductants, hydrogenation of organic groups, photography, xerography, and dyes. It has been tested as an experimental therapy. HUMAN STUDIES: Skin contact with anhydrous hydrazine leads to caustic-like burns and dissolves hair. Allergic contact dermatitis has been reported. Exposure to the eyes can produce temporary blindness. Liquid splashes to the eyes can produce corneal injury and burns. In cases of acute human poisoning, vomiting, severe irritation of the respiratory tract with the development of pulmonary edema, central nervous system depression, and hepatic and renal damage have been reported. Allergic contact dermatitis has been reported. Exposure to hydrazine increases the risk of incident lung cancers and colon cancers, based on a study in a cohort of aerospace workers. ANIMAL STUDIES: Hydrazine hydrate produced moderately severe irritation when 3 to 5 mL was applied to rabbit cornea, whereas 1 mL was much less irritating. Rabbit skin that was treated with 3 mL of anhydrous hydrazine for 1 min, followed by washing the treated area. Despite washing, mortality ensued 60 to 90 min after application. Acute toxicity has been characterized by liver damage consisting of fatty degeneration, red blood cell destruction and anemia, anorexia, weight loss, weakness, vomiting, excitability, hypoglycemia, and convulsions. Groups of dogs, monkeys, rats, and mice were exposed either 24 hr/day, 7 days/wk to 6.2 or 1 ppm, or 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk to 1 or 5 ppm hydrazine for 6 months. Mortality was seen in mice and dogs, but not in monkeys or rats. Dogs showed hematologic deficits and increased numbers of reticulocytes. Liver changes that consisted of moderate to severe fatty infiltration were marked in mice and dogs, were slight to moderate in monkeys, and were absent in the rat. Groups of rats were exposed orally during gestation to 8 mg/kg bw hydrazine. Maternal toxicity, including mortality and body weight loss, was seen, along with fetal toxicity that included reduced fetal weight and viability. Although some fetuses were pale and edematous, no major congenital malformations occurred. An increase in the number of lung tumors was observed in several strains of mice, but hydrazine did not increase the tumor yield in rats following either sc injection or intratracheal application. Hydrazine is positive in most standard assays for genetic toxicity endpoints. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Eggs of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) at the mid-cleavage stage were exposed to hydrazine for 24 or 48 hr. Embryos, exposed for 24 hr, to 0.1 mg/L, showed several defects, such as slightly or moderately subnormal heart beat, hemoglobin levels, body movement, and amount of eye pigment. Embryos exposed to a hydrazine concentration of 1.0 mg/L for 48 hr appeared to have little chance of survival. Surviving embryos showed severe deformities and larvae exhibited reduced growth.",

One involves the direct binding of those hydrazines with a free amino group (hydrazine and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine) to key cellular molecules. Hydrazine reacts with alpha-keto acids such as vitamin B6 to form hydrazoines compounds. By binding to keto acids and forming hydrazones, hydrazine inhibits oxygen consumption with mitochondrial substrates in vitro. A second mechanism involves the generation of reactive species such as free radical intermediates or methyldiazonium ions as a result of metabolism. (L154)",

This clastogenic adaptation was not observed when the alkylating agent triethylene melamine was used instead of maleic hydrazide. Thus, pretreatment with the hydrazines induces an error-free repair system which reduces maleic hydrazide-induced damage and both hydrazines and maleic hydrazide appear able to induce oxidative DNA lesions.",

The present study investigates the proposal that the methylation mechanism involves reaction of hydrazine with endogenous formaldehyde to yield formaldehyde hydrazone, which could be metabolized to the potent methylating agent diazomethane. Hamsters were pretreated with methanol, ethanol or cyanamide to alter the endogenous hepatic aldehyde levels prior to administration of hydrazine. Formaldehyde levels were refractory to the pretreatment; hepatic acetaldehyde levels were increased, but hydrazine administration under such conditions did not result in the formation of ethylated guanines in DNA. Methanol and ethanol inhibited hydrazine-induced methylaton of DNA. Hydrazine incubated with liver S9 fraction and calf thymus DNA induced the formation of 7-methylguanine and O6-methylguanine when formaldehyde was present in the incubation system; substitution of formaldehyde with acetaldehyde in the incubation medium did not result in any detectable alkylation of DNA. Both liver microsomal and cytosolic fractions demonstrated heat-labile activity in supporting the hydrazine-induced methylation process. Tetraformyltrisazine or a similar reaction product of hydrazine and formaldehyde, may be a more important intermediate than formaldehyde hydrazone in the hydrazine-induced methylation of DNA.",

The effect of pretreatment of rats with various inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome p450 on these dose-response relationships was investigated. Pretreatment with the inhibitor piperonyl butoxide increased triglyceride accumulation whereas pretreatment with the inducers phenobarbital and beta-naphthoflavone resulted in reduced triglyceride accumulation. Pretreatment with the inducers acetone and isoniazid also enhanced triglyceride accumulation. Only phenobarbital pretreatment also significantly reduced glutathione and ATP depletion. A linear correlation was found between hepatic glutathione and ATP levels in non-pretreated animals given various doses of hydrazine. However, exponential relationships were found between hepatic triglycerides and both hepatic ATP and glutathione. The results suggest that i) the hepatotoxicity of hydrazine can be modulated by inducing or inhibiting particular isoenzymes of cytochrome p450, ii) ATP and glutathione depletion may not be directly involved in the development of fatty liver.",

The direct biochemical effects of hydrazine in kidney, liver, and brain tissue were assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats using magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A single dose of hydrazine (90 mg/kg) resulted in changes to the biochemical composition of the liver after 24 hr including an increase in triglycerides and beta-alanine, together with a decrease in hepatic glycogen, glucose, choline, taurine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). From histopathology measurements of liver tissue, minimal to mild hepatocyte alteration was observed in all animals at 24 hr. The NMR spectra of the renal cortex at 24 hr after dosing were dominated by a marked increase in the tissue concentration of 2-aminoadipate (2-AA) and beta-alanine, concomitant with depletions in TMAO, myo-inositol, choline, taurine, glutamate, and lysine. No alteration to the NMR spectral profile of the substantia nigra was observed after hydrazine administration, but perturbations to the relative concentrations of creatine, aspartate, myo-inositol, and N-acetyl aspartate were apparent in the hippocampus of hydrazine-treated animals at 24 hr postdose. No overt signs of histopathological toxicity were observed in either the kidney or the brain regions examined. Elevated alanine levels were observed in all tissues indicative of a general inhibition of alanine transaminase activity. By 168 hr postdose, NMR spectral profiles of treated rats appeared similar to those of matched controls for all tissue types indicative of recovery from toxic insult.",

Genotypes of N-acetyl transferases, NAT2*, were determined using polymerase chain reaction for 297 male workers. Biological and exposure monitoring were also conducted. The rapid and intermediate acetylators accounted for 45% each, and the slow acetylators accounted for 10%. Biological half-lives were significantly different among the three acetylation phenotypes (analysis of variance, P < 0.05): 3.94+/-1.70 hours for slow acetylators, 2.25+/-0.37 hours for intermediate acetylators, and 1.86+/-0.67 hours for rapid acetylators. Among Japanese, rapid and intermediate acetylators are the major phenotypes, which is in sharp contrast with those among Caucasians./The authors/ conclude that biological monitoring should take genetic factors, which may vary dramatically among different populations, into account.",

Hydrazine is also produced naturally by the bacterium Azotobacter agile during nitrogen fixation. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 14.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates hydrazine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase hydrazine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.6 hours. Hydrazine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, hydrazine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 13. The pKa of hydrazine is 7.96, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form as a weak base in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the free base from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an environmental fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Hydrazine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Hydrazine appears to degrade more rapidly in soil than in water, with oxidation as the main removal processes. Biodegradation was a relatively minor fate process; in non-sterile soils, 20% of hydrazine loss was attributed to biodegradation. If released into water, hydrazine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Utilizing fresh water inoculm, 90% of a low concentration of hydrazine was reached in 2 hours indicating that biodegradation is an environmental fate process in water. However the compound is toxic to microorganisms at high concentrations. Volatilization of the free base from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. The pKa indicates hydrazine will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 34 and 250 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. In aqueous systems, the primary mechanism of hydrazine degradation is oxidation to N2 gas by oxygen. Hydrazine is degraded rapidly in water through abiotic processes. The half-life of hydrazine in pond water was about 8.3 days. Hard water and water rich in dissolved organic matter tend to degrade hydrazine more rapidly than water containing lower amounts of organic matter and calcium carbonate. Hydrazine solutions are inherently unstable in the presence of oxygen under alkaline or neutral conditions (the autoxidation rate was found to be higher at pH 7.0 than at pH 9.0); however, they are quite stable under strongly acidic conditions or in the absence of oxygen. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation or dermal contact at workplaces where hydrazine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to hydrazine through inhalation of cigarette smoke. (SRC)",

Hydrazine is a weak base with a pKa of 7.96(3), which indicates it will exist partially in the protonated form in moist soils, and this species may adsorb more than the free base(3). Volatilization of free-base hydrazine from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an environmental fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure, 14.4 mm Hg(4), and assigned value for water solubility of 1.0X10+6 mg/L (miscible)(5). Hydrazine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). Hydrazine appears to degrade more rapidly in soil than in water, with oxidation as the main removal processes. Comparison to degradation rates in sterile soils indicated that autoxidation appeared to be the major factor contributing to disappearance of the chemical with <3% recovered from sterile soil. Biodegradation was a relatively minor fate process; in non-sterile soils, 20% of hydrazine loss was attributed to biodegradation(6).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is  expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 14.4 mm Hg(4), and assigned value for water solubility of 1.0X10+6 mg/L (miscible)(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 34 and 250 days, respectively(SRC). A pKa of 7.92(6) indicates hydrazine will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its Kow of -2.07(8) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Utilizing fresh water inoculm, 90% of a low concentration of hydrazine was reached in 2 hours(9) indicating that biodegradation is an environmental fate process in water(SRC). However the compound is toxic to microorganisms at high concentrations(9).",

In pond water, 20%, 74%, 80%, and 81.6% of the added hydrazine, initially at 5 mg/L, was degraded after about 1 hr, 1 day, 2 days and 3 days, respectively(2). Hydrazine will react with dissolved oxygen at a rate inversely proportional to the concentration of hydrazine. After 4 days, 52%, 48%, 21.4% and 7.4% of the added hydrazine had degraded in hard water, moderately hard water, slightly hard water, and soft water samples, respectively. The addition of organic matter increased the amount of hydrazine degraded(2). Hydrazine solutions are inherently unstable in the presence of oxygen under alkaline or neutral conditions (the autoxidation rate was found to be higher at pH 7.0 than at pH 9.0); however, they are quite stable under strongly acidic conditions or in the absence of oxygen(3).",

Vapor-phase hydrazine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 6.6 hours, calculated from its rate constant of 3.7X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Vapor-phase hydrazine also reacts with ozone(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 9 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4). It was estimated that the half-life for the reaction of hydrazine with ozone would be <10 minutes during ozone pollution episodes and <2 hours in the 'natural' troposphere(5). Hydrazine will react rapidly with nitrogen oxides in the light and in the dark with a half-life of about 2 hours(6). Hydrazine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The degradation rate increased with increasing temperature, dissolved oxygen, and the presence of microorganisms at pH values of 6-8(2). Hydrazine at 500 mg/L, present in a wastewater mixture of other hydrazine compounds, was incubated with an inoculum prepared from a trickling filter plant; following a 24 hour lag period, this mixture of compounds was readily biodegraded as measured by oxygen uptake(3).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6.6 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the reaction of vapor-phase hydrazine with ozone, determined in a static system with an FT-IR detector, is 3X10-17 cu cm/molecule/sec at 298 K(2). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 9 hours(SRC) at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). Apparent degradation rates of about 0.2 ppm/min and about 0.3 ppm/min for the reaction between ozone and hydrazine were estimated from decay rates for the two species determined in the dark in a 30,000 L Teflon outdoor chamber at 21-24 and 44 \u00b0C(3). The major product of the reaction was hydrogen peroxide; N20 and NH3 were minor products(3). It was estimated that the half-life for the reaction of hydrazine with ozone would be <10 min during ozone pollution episodes and <2 hr in the 'natural' troposphere(3). In the absence of ozone, the hydrazine half-life at 15 \u00b0C and 16% relative humidity is 5 hr, and at 14 \u00b0C and 85% relative humidity is 1.8 hr(3). Ammonia was detected but accounted for only 5-10% of the hydrazine which decayed(3). Hydrazine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The level of nitrous oxide increased throughout the experiment. In the dark under similar conditions, 15% of the initial hydrazine degraded in 26 min and the half-life was about 2 hr(1). Decomposition of the hydrazine to nitrogen gas and water predominated and no evidence of a reaction between hydrazine and nitrogen oxides was observed(1). The half-life for the reaction between hydrazine in atmospheric aerosols with ozone is about 100 min(2). Nitrogen and water are products of the aqueous ozone oxidation of hydrazine(2). The relative contributions to ozone oxidation of hydrazine via aqueous and gas phase routes were estimated for both a moderately polluted and a remote environment; aqueous and gas phase oxidation rates, based on the total amounts of hydrazines present in all forms were slower in the polluted than in the remote environment(3). Aqueous aerosol from a polluted environment would have a much lower pH where 99% or more of the total particular hydrazine present is dissolved in the aerosol as the protonated form; this form oxidizes slowly, if at all(3).",

After 4 days, 10%, 100% and 40% of the added hydrazine had degraded in the city, county and laboratory waters, respectively(1). This result was attributed to the relatively high hardness of the county water(1). The contribution of water hardness to hydrazine degradation was confirmed in another experiment. Samples of hard water, moderately hard water, slightly hard water, and soft water were mixed with 5 mg/L hydrazine. After 4 days, 52%, 48%, 21.4% and 7.4% of the added hydrazine had degraded in the hard water, moderately hard water, lightly hard water, and soft water, respectively(1). After 4 days in hard water with and without fish excreta, 100% and 55% of the added hydrazine had degraded. After 4 days in soft water with and without fish excreta, 70% and 10% of the added hydrazine had degraded(1). Polluting material, rich in organic matter, was the leading contributor to hydrazine degradation(1); it was shown that dissolved organic matter in pond water reduces the effective concentration of added copper, decreasing the rate of hydrazine autoxidation(2). In aqueous systems, the primary mechanism of hydrazine degradation seems to be a four-electron oxidation to N2 gas by oxygen. The oxidation rate was very slow in distilled water but increased with the addition of catalysts such as Cu(II) and phosphate ions. Ammonia as well as N2 gas evolution was correlated with Cu(II) and phosphate ion concentration(3). Hydrazine solutions are inherently unstable in the presence of oxygen under alkaline or neutral conditions (the autoxidation rate was found to be higher at pH 7.0 than at pH 9.0); however, they are quite stable under strongly acidic conditions or in the absence of oxygen(3). After four hours, approximately 72%, 60%, 47%, and 39% of the hydrazine initially present at 0.047, 0.068, 0.158 and 0.195 ppm, respectively, reacted with oxygen in air-saturated distilled water at 20 \u00b0C and pH 9(4).",

Hydrazine applied to nonsterile Arredondo soil (fine sand; pH 5.7; OC 1.7%) at concentrations of 10, 100, and 500 ug/g was completely degraded in 1.5 hours, 1 day, and 8 days, respectively. In this study, comparison to degradation rates in sterile soils indicated that autoxidation appeared to be the major factor contributing to disappearance of the chemical with <3% recovered from sterile soil. Biodegradation was a relatively minor fate process; in non-sterile soils, 20% of hydrazine loss was attributed to biodegradation(1).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that hydrazine is expected to have very high mobility in soil. The pKa of hydrazine is 7.92(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). The nature and extent of hydrazine adsorption by clays and soils is very dependent on suspension pH and on the types of surface functional groups present on the solid matrix. Under acidic conditions, pH 4.0, 99.9% of the hydrazine is present as the protonated species and should be able to readily replace Na+ from exchange sites(3). Under alkaline conditions, pH 8.0, approximately 50% of the hydrazine is protonated and 50% is in neutral form. The primary mechanism of hydrazine adsorption in a montmorillonite clay suspension was cation exchange, both at pH 4 and 8; adsorption of hydrazine was lower at the higher pH value(3). The main mechanism for hydrazine retention at pH 4 and at low hydrazine concentrations in the upper Arrendondo soil horizon (fine sand) was also cation exchange. At higher concentrations more than 60% of the hydrazine interacted with a different type of binding site, possibly with organic-surface functional groups such as carbonyl groups(3). Under alkaline conditions, using upper horizon Arrendondo soil, (at pH 8.0) hydrazine was adsorbed more readily than at pH 4(3).",

Passage of water through columns containing cleaned sand, VAFB soil, organic soil and clay (10% clay soil plus 90% pure sand) treated with 10 ml of a 0.1 v/v solution of hydrazine resulted in 89.1%, 1.6%, 1.3% and 7.6% recovery of hydrazine, respectively(1). The adsorption of hydrazine to montmorillonite follows an L-2 type isotherm with an initial slope that is nonlinear and concave with respect to the abscissa(2). This indicates that hydrazine has a preferential sorption initially compared to the solvent or other solutes, with sorption decreasing as more hydrazine is sorbed(2).",

The Henry's Law constant for the neutral species of hydrazine is estimated as 6.07X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 14.4 mm Hg(2), and assigned value for water solubility of 1.0X10+6 mg/L (miscible)(3). This Henry's Law constant indicates that hydrazine is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water and moist soil surfaces(4). With an air velocity at the liquid surface of 63.5 cm/sec, the volatilization of hydrazine from petri dishes containing 25%, 50% and 75% hydrazine-water mixtures was 0.5 g after 6.66 hr, about 1 g after 5 hr, and about 3 g after 5 hr, respectively(5). At each concentration, the rate of volatilization decreased with time(5). Hydrazine's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of hydrazine from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

The report summarizes production and uses of hydrazine compounds, the toxic effects of such compounds, relevant exposure standards, sampling and analytical methods relevant to exposure assessment, and observations made during surveys conducted at eight facilities in the United States where these compounds were either prepared or used. The sites visited for the survey were of four basic types: those which used hydrazine compounds as propellants, those which manufactured the compounds, those which used hydrazine as an aircraft emergency power unit fuel, or sites where hydrazine was used in boiler water treatment. Personal exposures measured were generally within the range from below the limit of detection to 1.0 ppm as an 8 hour time weighted average. The OSHA permissible exposure limits for the hydrazine compounds of interest ranged from 0.5 to 5 ppm. The number of workers exposed was found to be low. Large scale propellant and emergency jet power unit usage was relatively new, and the manufacturing methods had not been used until recently. /Data indicated/ that the accumulated person years of exposure are relatively low; it is unlikely that suitable cohorts exist for retrospective exposure studies. /Hydrazine compounds/",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Regional brain distribution of 14C was determined 2 hr following single doses of TRCP to male and female rats, and 24 hr after a single dose and the last of 14 daily doses of TRCP to female rats. Results of these studies indicate that TRCP is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, distributed to all brain regions, and that metabolism and excretion are nearly complete in 72 hr. Most of the TRCP-derived radioactivity was excreted in urine (up to 85%), with feces, volatiles, and CO2 combined accounting for less than 10% of the dose. Predominant signs of toxicity associated with TRCP administration (350 and 700 mg/kg) were seizures within 2 hr of treatment, when most of the TRCP-derived radioactivity present in brain tissue was in the form of the parent compound. Traces of inextractable 14C were detected at later times, but this material was not concentrated in brain relative to other tissues.",

This lesion is more common and more severe in female F344 rats than in male F344 rats, and is not observed in B6C3F1 mice. The present investigation of the metabolism of TRCP was designed to detect sex and species variations that might account for differences in toxicity. Elimination of TRCP-derived radioactivity was more rapid in mice, which excreted greater than 70% of an oral dose of 175 mg/kg in urine in 8 hr vs approximately 40% for male or female rats. However, the metabolic profile of TRCP-derived radioactivity in urine was similar for both species. The major metabolite in female rat urine was identified as bis(2-chloroethyl) carboxymethyl phosphate. This metabolite co-chromatographed with the major metabolite found in both male rat and mouse urine. Two additional metabolites identified in female rat urine were bis(2-chloroethyl) hydrogen phosphate and the glucuronide of bis(2-chloroethyl) 2-hydroxyethyl phosphate. These metabolites also cochromatographed with metabolites found in male rat and mouse urine. TRCP metabolism in rats was not induced or inhibited by nine daily 175 mg/kg doses. Toxicity, as evidenced by seizures, was potentiated in male rats pretreated with inhibitors of aldehyde dehydrogenase.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.89X10-2 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 hours. Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 98-103% of the theoretical BOD was reached over a 4 week incubation period using an activated sludge, indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 300 and 30 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively, suggest that hydrolysis is only expected to be an important process under alkaline conditions. Occupational exposure to diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate via dermal contact with products containing diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 9.89X10-2 mm Hg(4), and assigned value for water solubility(2). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 300 and 30 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively(8), suggest that hydrolysis is only expected to be an important process under alkaline conditions(SRC). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 98-103% of the theoretical BOD was reached over a 4 week incubation period using an activated sludge and an initial chemical concentration of 100 mg/L(9), indicating that biodegradation in soil is an important environmental fate process(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

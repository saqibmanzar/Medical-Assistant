Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Without diisopropylphosphofluoridate, about 96% of the total penetrated amount appeared as metabolized p-hydroxybenzoic acid in the receptor fluid after application of butylparaben, whereas about 30% penetrated as intact form after application of propylparaben. On the other hand, metabolized p-hydroxybenzoic acid was not detected in the receptor fluid under pretreatment with DFP. DFP significantly decreased the total amount that penetrated after application of butylparaben, but it did not significantly affect that of propylparaben. It was concluded that skin metabolism directly affected the total amount that penetrated in the case of highly lipophilic drugs, and that the higher the metabolic rate to hydrophilic drugs, the greater the amount that penetrated the skin.",

Tremors, chewing movements and hind-limb abduction induced by DFP incr in a steeply dose-dependent manner. Tremor occurred in a complex spectrum of slow to intense fast types. Except for chewing, tolerance developed for these parameters, but at different rates. After acute treatment striatal dopamine (DA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels were altered and the DOPAC/DA ratios were consistently incr within about the first 2 hr, suggesting an incr turnover of DA. It is suggested that the changes in DA metab arose secondarily to an elevation of brain acetylcholine following cholinesterase inhibition. A prolonged change in the levels or turnover of DA could be responsible for incr of postsynaptic DA receptor density previously found, which might then partly mediate the behavioral tolerance to DFP.",

Combinations of these agents with 2-pyridine aldoxime methochloride (2-PAM) (50 mg/kg) improved prophylactic action even further even further.

Drugs tested were ketamine, phenobarbital, lidocaine, morphine, prednisolone, and lithium. All mice were injected with DFP (7.6 mg/kg) plus atropine; the treatment groups were simultaneously injected with the test drug, while controls received an equal volume of physiological saline. All the test drugs, at one or more doses, revealed protection, not only in terms of prolonging symptom onset but also in terms of mortality. The reduction in mortality was quantitatively similar for each drug. Although the various drugs could have protected by many different, coincidental mechanisms, a more parsimonious explanation is that the effect could have been due to one property which all had in common; namely, sodium-channel blockade.",

This test may be useful for identification of the compound in cases of severe exposure, although documented tests for measurement of specific organophosphate pesticides in blood are very limited. Blood Reference Ranges: Normal - None detected; Exposed - Not detected; Toxic - Not established. Serum or Plasma Reference Ranges: Normal - Not established; Exposed - Not established; Toxic - Not established. Urine: The assessment of organophosphate pesticide exposure can be accomplished through measurement of the following alkyl phosphate metabolites: dimethylphosphate, diethylphosphate, dimethylthiophosphate, diethylthiophosphate, dimethyldithiophosphate, and diethyldithiophosphate. ... The one limitation to measurement of urinary alkyl metabolites is that this test is only useful for assessing recent exposure, due to the short half-life of organophosphate pesticides.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.54 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diisopropyl fluorophosphate will exist solely in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase diisopropyl fluorophosphate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hrs. If released to soil, diisopropyl fluorophosphate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 31. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, diisopropyl fluorophosphate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 250 hrs and 120 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate does undergo hydrolysis to HF and diisopropyl phosphate; half-lives range from 16.7 hrs to 2.2 days at temperatures of 37 to 25 \u00b0C and 72 hrs to several days at temperatures of 15 to 30 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to diisopropyl fluorophosphate may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diisopropyl fluorophosphate is produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase diisopropyl fluorophosphate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3) determined using a structure estimation method(3).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Diisopropyl fluorophosphate does undergo hydrolysis. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate in a 0.03 m bicarbonate buffer with a pH of 7.4 at a temperature of 37 \u00b0C had a half-life of 16.7 hours(2). Extrapolation of these data to 25 \u00b0C(3) gives a half-life of approximately 2.2 days. Other researchers report a half-life of several days at 30 \u00b0C and pH 7.6 and that in dilute solutions (pH not indicated) hydrolysis goes to completion in 72 hr at 15 \u00b0C(4,5). A kinetic study of the hydrolysis of diisopropyl fluorophosphate in neutral and acid aqueous solutions found the reaction to be autocatalytic and catalyzed by hydrogen ions for an initial rate of 0.6%/hr that was independent of the initial concentration of diisopropyl fluorophosphate and produced diisopropyl phosphate and HF(5). Cupric ions are extremely effective at catalyzing the hydrolysis of diisopropyl fluorophosphate although other ions are less effective or without effect(4). This suggests that some soils may catalyze hydrolysis but experimental data are lacking.",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

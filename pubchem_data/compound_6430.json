Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Inhaled fluorocarbons sensitized the myocardium to catecholamines, frequently resulting in lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Because they are gases heavier than air, fluorocarbons can displace atmospheric oxygen, thus resulting in asphyxiation. These compounds also have a central nervous system (CNS) anesthetic effect analogous to a structurally similar general anesthetic, halothane. Pressurized refrigerant or liquid fluorocarbons with a low boiling point have a cyrogenic effect on exposed tissues, causing frostbite, laryngeal or pulmonary edema, and gastrointestinal perforation. Certain fluorocarbons degrade at high temperatures into toxic products of chlorine, hydrofluoric acid, or phosgene gases. /Freons/",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /CFCs and HCFCs/",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The original Montreal Protocol was agreed on 16 September 1987 and entered into force on 1 January 1989. The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(v) and 2.125(e)(4)(iv) is effective December 31, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(iii) is effective June 30, 2011. Removal of 2.125(e)(2)(iv) and Part 2.125(e)(4)(viii) is effective December 31, 2013. /Ozone-Depleting Substances/",

Patients must be removed from the exposure environment, & high flow supplemental oxygen should be utilized. The respiratory system should be evaluated for injury, aspiration, or pulmonary edema & treated appropriately. CNS findings should be treated supportively. A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin & countershock may be effective. Cryogenic dermal injuries should be treated by water bath rewarming at 40-42 \u00b0C until vasodilatory flush has returned. Elevation of the limb & standard frostbite management with late surgical debridement should be utilized. Ocular exposure requires irrigation & slit lamp evaluation for injury. /Freons/",

Freezing of airway soft tissues can probably be eliminated as a cause of death except in cases where the product was sprayed directly into the mouth from its container or from a balloon containing some liquid. Laryngeal spasm or edema, oxygen displacement, or sensitization of myocardium to endogenous catecholamines with subsequent ventricular fibrillation appear to be reasonable possibilities. /Fluorocarbon refrigerants & propellants/",

The exposure of the upper respiratory tract to aerosol propellants produces apnea, bradycardia, and biphasic fall and rise in aortic blood pressure in anesthetized dogs. This response represents the irritation of sensory receptors in the nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa and is not elicited with aerosol propellants administered via a tracheal cannula bypassing the upper respiratory tract. When this is done, a different response is elicited, consisting of tachycardia that is mediated by the thoracic sympathetic nerves. There is either bronchodilation or bronchoconstriction depending on the type of propellant. I, II, and III, widely used as aerosols, when inspired in large doses elicit both bradycardia and tachycardia and induce bronchoconstriction or bronchodilation. Two additional fluorocarbons, IV and V, which are not ordinarily used to dispense bronchodilator drugs, do not elicit any change in heart rate and produce only bronchodilation. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6860 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chloropentafluoroethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase chloropentafluoroethane is essentially inert in the troposphere. Chlorpentafluoroethane will gradually diffuse into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will slowly degrade due to direct photolysis from UV-C radiation and contribute to the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone. The atmospheric lifetime of this compound has been estimated at 330 years. If released to soil, chloropentafluoroethane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.6 atm-cu m/mole. Chloropentafluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Highly chlorinated/fluorinated compounds such as chloropentafluoroethane are not expected to biodegrade rapidly. If released into water, chloropentafluoroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 20 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure should be low or non-existent since chloropentafluoroethane is no longer produced or used in the US. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to chloropentafluoroethane via inhalation of ambient air, mostly due to its long atmospheric residence time. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

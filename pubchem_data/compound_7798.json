When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The method involved a single ether extraction of a water-diluted honey sample followed by gas chromatographic analysis. The bee repellent residues detected in the honey for each repellent included: butyric acid from butyric anhydride (Bee Go); propionic acid from propionic anhydride; phenol from applied phenol, and benzoic acid from benzaldehyde. Quantification of benzoic acid in honey samples was hindered by the varying amounts of natural benzoic acid in honey. From field trials, it seemed that the use of phenol and propionic anhydride left considerably larger amounts of residue (averaging 6.6 ppm for phenol and 7.9 ppm for propionic anhydride) in honey than the use of butyric anhydride or benzaldehyde (most samples containing trace levels, < 0.05 ppm).",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates butyric anhydride will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase butyric anhydride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.8 days. If released to soil, butyric anhydride is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Due to hydrolysis, volatilization and leaching in wet soils are not expected to be important fate processes. Volatilization from dry surfaces is possible based upon the vapor pressure and butyric anhydride's existence as a liquid at ambient temperatures. If released to water, hydrolysis will be dominant fate process. Based on analogy to similar anhydrides, the neutral hydrolysis half-life of butyric anhydride at 25 \u00b0C is about 4.3 minutes. An estimated base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 3440 L/mole-sec corresponds to half-lives of 17 and 1.7 minutes at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to butyric anhydride may occur through inhalation of vapor and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where butyric anhydride is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

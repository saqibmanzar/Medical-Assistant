It is a phenoxymethyl analog of Penicillin G, or [benzylpenicillin]. An orally active naturally penicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin is used to treat mild to moderate infections in the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissues caused by penicillin G\u00ad-sensitive microorganisms. Phenoxymethylpenicillin has also be used in some cases as prophylaxis against susceptible organisms. While there have been no controlled clinical efficacy studies that were conducted, phenoxymethylpenicillin has been suggested by the American Heart Association and the American Dental Association for use as an oral regimen for prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis in patients with congenital heart disease or rheumatic or other acquired valvular heart disease when they undergo dental procedures and surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract, except for those who are at an elevated risk for endocarditis.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The bioavailability of phenoxymethylpenicillin ranges from 25 to 60%.

It is reported that fasting state enhances the drug absorption. The peak plasma concentrations of 200 to 700 ng/mL are achieved in 2 hours following an oral dose of 125 mg. Following an oral dose of 500 mg, the peak plasma concentrations of 3 to 5 \u03bcg/mL are reached in 30 to 60 minutes post-dose.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

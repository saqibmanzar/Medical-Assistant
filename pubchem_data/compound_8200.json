ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It is used as a solvent for nitrocellulose, plasticizer, lacquers, coating compositions.  It is also used in ceramic paste/printing ink binder; as a lubricant (metalworking fluids/textile spin finishes), softening agent (paper tissue), and fragrance ingredient and viscosity decreasing agent in cosmetic formulations.   HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: TetraEG caused minimal skin irritation and was not a skin sensitizer when tested in humans.  ANIMAL STUDIES:  TetraEG did not cause any adverse events when rats were exposed to vapors of this material for 8 hrs.  Instillation of 0.1 mL of sample into rabbit eyes produced minor, transient irritation which did not involve the cornea.  TetraEG exhibited no potential to produce dermal sensitization in the guinea pig.  No treatment-related effects of toxicological significance were noted in rats administered TetraEG in the drinking water to provide up to 2000 mg/kg/d for 4 weeks.  TetraEG  did not produce significant mutagenic effect in the CHO gene mutation assay in the tests with and without metabolic activation and was negative in Ames (Salmonella) gene mutation test. However, it produced statistically significant increases of SCEs in tests with and without metabolic activation, but the increases did not occur with a dose-related trend characteristic of genotoxic agents. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: For fish, snail, copepod, protozoan and fungi LC50 values of DMSO, ethlyene glycol, triethylene glycolmonomethyl ether and tetraethylene glycol were more than 30000 ppm. These solvents exhibit the lowest toxicity compared to other surfactants and their acceptable concentration was estimated at about 300 ppm.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.65X10-5 mm Hg at 26 \u00b0C indicates tetraethylene glycol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tetraethylene glycol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.6 hours. Particulate-phase tetraethylene glycol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Tetraethylene glycol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tetraethylene glycol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Tetraethylene glycol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Tetraethylene glycol is expected to biodegrade in soil and water based upon a 4% degradation in 5 days under unacclimated conditions to an 88% degradation in 20 days after acclimation, both using a wastewater inoculum. If released into water, tetraethylene glycol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to tetraethylene glycol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tetraethylene glycol is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to tetraethylene glycol via dermal contact with consumer products containing tetraethylene glycol. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase tetraethylene glycol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.6 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase tetraethylene glycol may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Tetraethylene glycol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

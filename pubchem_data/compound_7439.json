Volatiles produced were sampled by means of headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and the compounds were analyzed and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Yields (expressed as % of biotransformation) varied in dependence of the strain. The reduction of both (4R)-(-)-carvone and (1R)-(-)-myrtenal were catalyzed by some ene-reductases (ERs) and/or carbonyl reductases (CRs), which determined the formation of (1R,4R)-dihydrocarvone and (1R)-myrtenol respectively, as main flavoring products. The potential of NCYs as novel whole-cell biocatalysts for selective biotransformation of electron-poor alkenes for producing flavors and fragrances of industrial interest is discussed.",

No toxicokinetic data on carvone in animals are available. The evidence from in vivo, in vitro, and in silico assessments has shown that carvone metabolism is likely to be different in humans and rats - with further possible differences between metabolism in male and female rats. It is also evident that when compared with carvone itself, the metabolites are not likely to be different in terms of GI uptake or half-life in the body. Toxicokinetic data on other monoterpenes in the rat such as menthol suggest that metabolism involves conjugation to a glucuronide for which enterohepatic recirculation occurs in the rat but not in humans. Considering the molecular weight of glucuronidated carvone metabolites, they may undergo enterohepatic recirculation in rats but not in humans, making the rat more sensitive than humans for these compounds. /D-Carvone and L-Carvone/",

Chemical structures of the metabolites were elucidated using mass spectral analysis in combination with metabolite syntheses and NMR analysis. For this, the urinary samples were treated with sulphatase and glucuronidase, assuming conjugation of phase I metabolites. However, no quantitative data on excretion of conjugated forms of the metabolites were reported. The study identified three side-chain oxidation products as the main primary unconjugated metabolites of D- and L-carvone: dihydrocarvonic acid, carvonic acid, and uroterpenolone, with 10-hydroxycarvone as the proposed intermediate metabolic step. However, unlike other species, the presence of 10-hydroxycarvone was not detected in humans and /it was/ suggested this was due to more efficient oxidation of 10-hydroxycarvone leading to carvonic acid. According to /the study/, there were no differences in the metabolism of D- and L-carvone. However, the results presented only refer to \"after carvone ingestion\", although apparently both carvone enantiomers were ingested by the volunteers in independent trials. According to the author, all metabolites were identical after the application of either D- or L-carvone. However, the configurations of metabolites were not identified and the chromatographic analyses were only performed on a nonchiral stationary phase. This experimental set-up does not allow differentiation of the stereospecific metabolism of D- and L-carvone. /D-Carvone and L-Carvone/",

L-Carvone (spearmint oil) is authorised as plant growth regulator for post-harvest treatment of potatoes. Feed additive: D-Carvone is used in a commercial product claimed to improve the growth rate of weaned piglets. Veterinary use: Carvi aetheroleum (containing D-carvone) is used in veterinary medicinal products to facilitate breathing in new-borne animals, and to treat flatulence and disturbances of the stomach and the gut in farmed animals. Flavoring substance and natural food occurrence: both D- and L-carvone are broadly used as flavoring substances in various food categories. In addition, foods containing carvone as naturally occurring constituent are used as ingredients with flavoring properties; for example, caraway seeds are used to flavor bread (e.g. rye bread), cheese, sauerkraut, candies, meat products, sauces and alcoholic liqueurs (e.g German Kummel). Personal care products: D- and L-Carvone are used in a variety of non-food consumer products, including cosmetics and personal care products. Some of these, such as toothpaste and mouthwash may result in oral intake of carvone. Medicinal use: Carvi aetheroleum and carvi fructus are registered as herbal medicinal products by the European Medicines Agency. Uses as a laxative, in colic treatment, as a breath freshener, or to help digestion in young children have been reported. Other properties claimed for caraway seeds include antispasmodic, carminative /reduces flatulence/, emmenagogue /stimulates menstrual flow/, expectorant, galactagogue /increases breast milk/, stimulant, stomachic, and tonic properties. Alternative use: natural insect repellent.",

However, these carvones are now prepared synthetically, preferably from (+)- and (-)-limonenes. The conventional industrial method of carvone synthesis utilizes the selective addition of nitrosyl chloride to the endocyclic double bond of limonene. An alternative commercial process for the production of (-)-carvone starts from (+)-limonene 1,2-epoxide, a regioselective rearrangement of which leads to (-)-carveol ... (-)-Carveol is subsequently oxidized to (-)-carvone, possibly in a one-pot reaction",

The following uses have been identified for carvone: pesticide, feed additive, veterinary medicine use, flavoring substance and natural food occurrence, personal care products: D- and L-carvone are used in a variety of non-food consumer products, including cosmetics and personal care products. Some of these, such as toothpaste and mouthwash may result in oral intake of carvone. It is also used as natural insect repellent. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: The sensitizing potential of l-carvone has been considered low, but it has occasionally caused contact allergy in users of spearmint toothpaste and chewing gum. L-Carvone inhibited proliferation of MCF 7 and MDA MB 231 cells and inhibited the migration of breast cancer cell lines. L-carvone induced apoptosis as observed by nuclei fragmentation and the presence of apoptotic bodies in DAPI, AnnexinV/propidium iodide, and TUNEL assays. l-carvone exposure arrested MCF 7 cells in S phase of the cell cycle. DNA damage caused by L-carvone was apparent from the increased tail moment in comet assay, which could be induced by an increase in ROS that was measured using a fluorescence probe. ANIMAL STUDIES: Clinical signs after acute exposure in mice and rats were different depending on the route of exposure. After acute oral administration, these included hunched posture and lethargy and occasional body tremor with no abnormalities at necropsy. After acute dermal exposure no systemic or skin effects were observed whereas after inhalation of carvone, respiratory effects were noted as well as alopecia and impairment of body weight gain. Carvone caused transient depression of central nervous system activity in mice. In developmental study rats were given 0, 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg/day of D-carvone (95%) for 10 weeks prior to mating until termination. There were no differences between treated and control animals in any of the indices of reproductive performance or in the results of the sperm morphology and motility measurements. Males of the F0 generation given 30 mg/kg bw/day had increased relative kidney weights. Histopathology of the male kidneys showed changes typical of alpha2u-globulin nephropathy at all doses. No other histopathological changes were reported and no similar changes were observed in females. Males of the F1 generation given 30 and 90 mg/kg bw/day had increased mean relative liver and kidney weights. Histopathology of the male kidneys showed changes typical of alpha2u-globulin nephropathy at all doses. No differences were seen in females and no other histopathological changes were reported. Carvone showed equivocal results for mutagenicity in a sister chromatid exchange study and a chromosomal aberration study with Chinese hamster ovary cells. Results from an in vivo UDS assay in liver and an in vivo micronucleus test were negative while those of an in vitro test for chromosome aberrations were not clear-cut. It was concluded that carvone should not be considered genotoxic. Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were administered 0, 375, or 750 mg/kg D-carvone in corn oil by gavage, 5 days/wk for 103 weeks. Under the conditions of these two yr gavage studies, there was no evidence for the carcinogenic activity of D-carvone for male or female mice.",

In vitro permeation studies were carried out across neonatal rat epidermis from 2% w/v HPMC (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) gel containing 4% w/v of nicorandil (a model drug) and a selected concentration (12% w/v) of either R-carvone, S-carvone, or RS-carvone against a control. The stratum corneum (SC) of rats was treated with vehicle (70 %v/v ethanol-water) or ethanolic solutions of 12% w/v R-carvone, S-carvone or RS-carvone. The enhancement ratio (ER) of R-carvone, S-carvone, and RS-carvone when compared to control was about 37.1, 31.2, and 29.9, respectively, indicating enantioselective penetration enhancing effect of carvone enantiomers. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in the lag time required to produce a steady-state flux of nicorandil with S-carvone when compared to R-carvone and RS-carvone. DSC and FT-IR studies indicate that the investigated enantiomers of carvone exhibit a difference in their ability to affect the cellular organization of SC lipids and proteins thereby showing enantioselective transdermal drug permeation. It was concluded that R-carvone exhibited a higher penetration enhancing activity on transdermal permeation of nicorandil when compared to its S-isomer or racemic mixture.",

One group consists of organosulfur compounds found in Allium species, including garlic, onions, leeks, and shallots, and the other, two monoterpenes, i.e., D-limonene and D-carvone. In these experiments D-limonene and D-carvone were tested and reduced forestomach tumor formation by slightly over 60% and pulmonary adenoma formation by about 35%. The results of these studies provide evidence of an increasing diversity of naturally occurring compounds having the capacity to inhibit nitrosamine carcinogenesis.",

Considering that some anticonvulsants that blocked voltage-gated sodium channels (e.g., sodium valproate and carbamazepine) exert clinical antimanic effects, the aim of the present study was to evaluate (R)-(-)-carvone and (S)-(+)-carvone in animal models of mania (i.e., hyperlocomotion induced by methylphenidate and sleep deprivation). Mice that were treated with methylphenidate (5 mg/kg) or sleep-deprived for 24 hr using a multiple-platform protocol exhibited an increase in locomotor activity in an automated activity box. This effect was blocked by pretreatment with acute (R)-(-)-carvone (50-100 mg/kg), (S)-(+)-carvone (50-100 mg/kg), and lithium (100 mg/kg, positive control). These doses did not alter spontaneous locomotor activity in the methylphenidate-induced experiments while (S)-(+)-carvone decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in sleep deprivation experiment, indicating a sedative effect. Chronic 21-day treatment with (R)-(-)-carvone (100 mg/kg), (S)-(+)-carvone (100 mg/kg), and lithium also prevented methylphenidate-induced hyperactivity. The present results suggest that carvone may have an antimanic-like effect.",

The sensitizing potential of L-carvone has been considered low, but it has occasionally caused contact allergy in users of spearmint toothpaste and chewing gum. L-Carvone is also an oxidation product of D-limonene that occurs in solvents used increasingly in industry. We included L-carvone 5% pet. in the standard patch test series. In the 1st year, 541 patients were tested and 15 (2.77%) had positive, and 12 doubtful positive (?+) reactions to L-carvone. The strongest reactions were observed in 9 patients with concomitant Compositae sensitivity. The key clinical features and other contact allergies of the patients are presented. When re-testing with L-carvone in the same or lower concentrations, only 2 out of 8 patients had positive reactions. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed in terms of cross-reactions, concomitant sensitization, excited skin syndrome, irritancy and facilitated immunological response. /L-Carvone/",

Rats were monitored daily for condition and behavior; body weight and food consumption were recorded weekly. At the end of the study blood samples were taken from the retro-orbital sinus and examined for red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscle volume, mean cospuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, red cell distribution width, white blood cell count (WBC), differential WBC, prothrombin time, and partial prothrombin time. Serum separated from the same samples was examined for alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, Bilirubin, creatinine, glucose, urea, total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, sodium, potassium, chlorine, calcium, and phosphorous. At the end of the study all rats were subject to a necropsy including gross examination and weighing of adrenals, heart, kidneys, spleen and testes. Samples of these together with stomach and any abnormal tissues were preserved for microscopic examination but no examination was performed. At the highest dose (1000 mg/kg bw/day) all animals were killed in extremis on days 5-7, after displaying clinical signs, including reduced body weight and food consumption. Macroscopic examination at necropsy showed evidence of gastric irritation (thickening of the limiting ridge and alterations in forestomach epithelium). These animals showed signs of lethargy, hunched posture, uncoordinated movements, piloerection, emaciation, abnormal posture, recumbency, quick breathing, and diarrhea from day 4 onwards. No hematology or clinical chemistry data were obtained for the highest (1000 mg/kg bw/day) dose group. Prothrombin time was significantly reduced in males at the 200 mg/kg bw/day dose, otherwise there was no indication of any treatment-related effects on hematology or clinical chemistry. Mean relative kidney weight and heart weight of males was significantly increased compared to controls but there was no sign of a similar difference in females. /D-Carvone/",

Rats were monitored daily for condition and behavior; body weight and food consumption were recorded weekly. Ophthalmoscopy was carried out prior to treatment and at the end of the study on all rats. At the end of the study blood samples were taken from the retro-orbital sinus and examined for RBC, Hb, HCT, MCV, MCHb, MCHC, platelet count, red cell distribution width, WBC, differential WBC, PT and PTT. Serum separated from the same samples was examined for ALAT, ASAT, bilirubin, creatinine, glucose, urea, total protein, albumin, ALP, Na, K, Cl, Ca, and P. At the end of the study all rats were subject to a necropsy including gross examination and weighing of adrenals, brain, heart, kidneys, liver, ovaries, prostate, spleen, testes, and thymus. Samples of a full range of tissues were preserved for microscopic examination. Slides were prepared from all tissues of the control and high dose groups and examined microscopically. Based on the findings of this examination kidneys were examined from the remaining two treatment groups. There were no clinical observations that were considered to be related to treatment and no abnormalities observed in the ophthalmoscopic examination. Slightly reduced body weight gain of males at the highest dose (180 mg/kg bw/day) was matched by a reduced food intake. There were no treatment-related effects on the hematological results apart from reduction of prothrombin time (PT) of 180 mg/kg bw/day males (since a similar difference was present in the results of the 14-day study this may not be a chance finding) and a significant increase in partial thromboplastin time (PTT) for 180 mg/kg bw/day females. Clinical chemistry results are mostly similar for treated and control groups but high dose males had a significant reduction in ASAT and a reduction was also seen in females at the same dose but the difference was not significant. Apart from a non-dose-related reduction (approx 10%) in serum calcium in all treated female groups there were no treatment-related differences between the groups in the results of clinical chemistry analyses. Organ weights and weights expressed relative to body weight were similar for treated and control groups apart from those for liver and kidney. The relative liver weights of both sexes were significantly higher than those of controls at the highest dose and in females also at the intermediate dose. Mean relative kidney weights were significantly increased compared with controls for both sexes at the highest and intermediate dose. Although some statistically significant differences were seen between controls and treated animals in thymus and spleen weights these were confined to females and were not dose-related and are thus considered unlikely to be due to treatment. Microscopic examination revealed no histopathological changes related to treatment apart from those in the kidney which consisted of tubular necrosis, exclusively in male rats, and basophilic tubules in both sexes. /D-Carvone/",

Based on comparison of the lethal doses, thymol and p-cymene were selected as the most effective (LD50 = 18 and 21 mg/L, respectively, and LD90 = 25 and 30 mg/L, respectively). Although the LD50 for terpinolene and trans-anethole was also estimated at 21 mg/L), their LD90 was significantly higher compared to the substances above (245 and 34 mg/L, respectively). In total, 435 binary combinations were tested, of which 249 combinations showed a significant synergistic effect, while 74 combinations showed a significant antagonistic effect on mortality. Only nine substances were identified as being able to create a synergistic effect with more than 20 substances: limonene, trans-anethole, 4-allylanisole, carvacrol, isoeugenol, menthone, carvone, borneol, and camphor. The highest synergistic effect on larval mortality was achieved for the combinations: eugenol and isoeugenol, carvone and carvacrol, carvone and 4-allylanisole, carvone and a-terpineol, carvone and menthone, limonene and trans-anethole, limonene and menthone, a-pinene and menthone, beta-citronellol and menthone, carvacrol and 4-allylanisole, carvacrol and terpineol, a-terpinene and trans-anethole, camphor and menthone, camphene and menthone, and 4-allylanisole and menthone. Significant differences between achieved mortality and the mutual mixing ratio were found for the five selected binary mixtures that had shown the most significant synergistic effect in the previous tests. The mixture of limonene and trans-anethole showed the highest mortality, with the mixing ratio 1:1; the mixture of eugenol and isoeugenol caused 90.2% mortality, with the mixing ratio 1:3. One hundred percent mortality was achieved if carvacrol was contained in a mixture with carvone in a ratio >2. After a comparison of all our results, based on our experiments, we can choose two pairs that caused mortality higher than 90% in concentrations lower than 20 mg/L: limonene and trans-anethole (with the mixing ratio 1:1), and carvone and carvacrol (with the mixing ratio 1:2-3). The information gained can thus be used in the development of new botanical insecticides based on essential oils (EOs) and particularly in the creation of formulations.",

The optically active form L-carvone's use as an active ingredient in pesticides will result in its direct release to the environment. Carvone is found naturally in caraway and dill seed oils, mandarin seed oil, spearmint oil, and gingergrass oil. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.115 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates carvone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase carvone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 hours. Vapor-phase carvone may also react with ozone, the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 3 hours. Carvone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, carvone is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 140. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.73X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Carvone has an estimated vapor pressure of 0.115 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, carvone may volatilize from dry soil. Using the optically active form L-carvone in the Manometric Respirometry test, 90% biodegradation of L-carvone was reached in 4 weeks suggesting that biodegradation of carvone may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, carvone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 11 hours and 9 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 30 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to carvone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where carvone is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to carvone via ingestion of food and dermal contact with consumer products containing carvone. (SRC)",

Optically active form L-carvone is found in spearmint and kuromoji oils(1). The most significant natural sources of carvone are spearmint, dill, and caraway. The term spearmint is applied to various Mentha species including M. cardiaca, M. gracilis, M. spicata, and M. viridis and these usually contain 55-75% of the (R)-(-)-enantiomer. The (S)-(+)-enantiomer is found in dill (Anethum graveolens) at levels of 30-65% and at 50-75% in caraway (Carum carvi)(3).",

Carvone has an estimated vapor pressure of 0.115 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2), and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, carvone may volatilize from dry soil(SRC).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.73X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 11 hours and 9 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 30(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 3.07(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Using the optically active form L-carvone in the Manometric Respirometry test, 90% biodegradation of L-carvone was reached in 4 weeks(6) suggesting that biodegradation of carvone may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).[(1) Swann RL et al; Res Rev 85: 17-28 (1983) (2) US EPA; Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite.

Vapor-phase carvone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.41X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

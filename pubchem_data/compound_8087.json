PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Effects from exposure may include liver and kidney damage, and CNS depression. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus.  1,1'-Oxydi-2-propanol is only slightly flammable and must be preheated before ignition can occur. For fires involving this substance, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, alcohol foam, or water spray (applied gently to the surface).",

Commercial dipropylene glycol is composed of 3 isomers and is typically 98% pure. The commercial product is typically composed of up to 48% of the isomer 1,1'-oxydi-2-propanol.  1,1'-Oxydi-2-propanol is registered for use as an approved pesticide in the USA but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses.  It is also used as a solvent and in the production of  polyester and alkyd resins, reinforced plastics, and plasticizers.  Uses for dipropylene glycol include in printing industry, in antifreeze, and air sanitation, since its vapor is highly germicidal.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: There is no human toxicity data reported for 1,1'-oxydi-2-propanol.  ANIMAL STUDIES:  All toxicity data reported is for the related chemical dipropylene glycol. Although more acutely depressant to the central nervous system than ethylene, diethylene or propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol is still low in toxicity to animals, especially to the liver. It is not irritating to the skin and is not absorbed in toxic amounts through intact skin. Dipropylene glycol did cause death from kidney injury when administered at 10%.  Chronic administration to rats caused degeneration of tubular epithelium in the kidneys and  liver degeneration of parenchyma.  In dogs,  repeated gastric dosage of dipropylene glycol resulted in moderate degenerative changes in kidney and only minimal evidence of liver damage.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.3X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,2'-dihydroxydi-n-propyl ester will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,2'-dihydroxydi-n-propyl ester will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours. 2,2'-Dihydroxydi-n-propyl ester does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,2'-dihydroxydi-n-propyl ester is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.6X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. 2,2'-Dihydroxydi-n-propyl ester is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 1% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, 2,2'-dihydroxydi-n-propyl ester is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. BCFs of <2.2-4.6 and 0.3-1.4 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2,2'-dihydroxydi-n-propyl ester may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,2'-dihydroxydi-n-propyl ester is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,2'-dihydroxydi-n-propyl ester via ingestion of contaminated drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 2,2'-dihydroxydi-n-propyl ester.

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Corrosive chemicals will destroy the membranes of the mouth, throat, and esophagus and volatile chemicals have a high risk of being aspirated into the victim's lungs during vomiting. Thus, the risk of increasing the medical problems by inducing vomiting of a volatile corrosive chemical is very high. If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It has been detected in river water, sediments, and in industrial effluent discharge. If released to soil, benzotrifluoride will have low mobility. Volatilization of benzotrifluoride may be important from moist and dry soil surfaces. Benzotrifluoride will not be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil or water surfaces based upon its lack of absorption of light at wavelengths >290 nm. Biodegradation of benzotriflouride will not be an important fate process in soil or water according to a biodegradation study. If released to water, benzotrifluoride may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Benzotrifluoride may volatilize from water surfaces with estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake of about 3.6 hours and 4.8 days, respectively. Experimental BCF values of 26-54 and 31-58 suggest that benzotrifluoride will bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. If released to the atmosphere, benzotrifluoride will exist in the vapor phase. Vapor-phase benzotrifluoride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 35 days. Vapor-phase benzotrifluoride is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone with an estimated half-life of about 6.3 years. Particulate-phase benzotrifluoride may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. (SRC)",

Benzotrifluoride may volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.017 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values of vapor pressure(4) and water solubility(5). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.6 hours and 4.8 days, respectively(3,SRC). Experimental BCF values of 26-54 and 31-58(7) suggest that benzotrifluoride will bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC) according to a classification scheme(6). Benzotrifluoride will not be susceptible to direct photolysis on water surfaces based upon its lack of absorption of light at wavelengths >290 nm(8). Biodegradation will not be an important fate process in water based on two biodegradation tests(9).",

Vapor-phase benzotrifluoride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals(3); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 35 days(3,SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 4.8 days(3,SRC). Benzotrifluoride's high vapor pressure(1) and high Henry's Law constant(1,2,SRC) indicate that volatilization from dry and moist soil may occur(SRC).",

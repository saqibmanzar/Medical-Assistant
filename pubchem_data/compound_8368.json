PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Exposure to 2,6-dichlorotoluene may be via inhalation or dermal routes, primarily resulting from occupational activities, including those associated with production and use as a high boiling solvent, and its production and use as a chemical intermediate in the manufacture of dyestuffs and herbicides. Because it is a strong irritant, personnel involved with 2,6-dichlorotoluene should wear boots, protective gloves, and goggles. Avoid breathing vapor, or, before entering a contaminated area, wear a full-face mask self-contained breathing apparatus which provides eye protection. Broken packages containing 2,6-dichlorotoluene should not be handled without protective equipment. Wash away any material which may have contacted the body with copious amounts of water or soap and water. While this substance must be moderately heated before ignition occurs, 2,6-dichlorotoluene is nevertheless considered a combustion hazard. For fires involving 2,6-dichlorotoluene, extinguish with alcohol foam, carbon dioxide, dry chemical, or water in flooding quantities as fog (solid streams of water may be ineffective). This substance should be stored away from sparks, flames, and other sources of ignition, even though it is considered normally stable even under fire exposure conditions. Shipping regulations and other DOT regulatory requirements should be consulted before transport. If a 2,6-dichlorotoluene spill occurs, keep material out of water sources and sewers by building dikes to contain the flow, as necessary. Use water spray to knock down vapor. Prior to implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

Extraction with hexane and ethyl ether-hexane (1 + 1) was followed by concentration over steam, and gas chromatographic analysis with an electron capture detector. Volatile compounds were analyzed in a glass column coated with 6% SP-2100 plus 4% OV-ll on Chromosorb W. Semivolatile compounds, chlorinated compounds and pesticides were analyzed in a 70 m glass capillary column coated with 5 OV-101. Phenols were analyzed in a glass column packed with 1% SP-1240 DA on Supelcoport. The most efficient means of separation was to use the same glass column for volatile compounds, a DB-5 fused silica capillary column for semivolatile compounds, pesticides and phenols, and the same 1% SP-1240 DA glass column for separation of beta-BHC and pentachlorophenol. Recoveries ranged from 86.3 + or - 9.1% (mean + or - SD) to 105 + or - 10.4%. Sensitivities for semivolatile chlorinated compounds, pesticides and phenols were 4 ng/g for fat, 1 ng/g for tissue and 0.2 ng/ml for blood. Sensitivities for volatile compounds were 4-fold higher (16, 4 and 0.8, respectively). Sensitivities for dichlorobenzenes and dichlorotoluenes were 8 ng/g for fat, 2 ng/g for tissue and 0.4 ng/ml for blood.",

If released to the atmosphere, 2,6-dichlorotoluene will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere based on an estimated vapor pressure of 0.36 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 2,6-dichlorotoluene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 12 days. An estimated Koc value of 5,100 indicates that 2,6-dichlorotoluene may be immobile in soil. Volatilization from moist and dry soil surfaces may occur based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-3 atm-cu m/mole and 2,6-dichlorotoluene's estimated vapor pressure, respectively. Based on limited data, 2,6-dichlorotoluene may be resistant to anaerobic biodegradation. 2,6-Dichlorotoluene, at 1000 uM, was not readily biodegraded in an anoxic soil slurry; 30-35% biodegradation was reached after 150 days. 2,6-Dichlorotoluene should adsorb to suspended matter and sediment in water based on its estimated Koc value. This compound is expected to volatilize from water surfaces given its Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively, although adsorption to sediment and particulate matter in the water may attenuate this rate. An estimated BCF value of 1,100 indicates that 2,6-dichlorotoluene may bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms.(SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

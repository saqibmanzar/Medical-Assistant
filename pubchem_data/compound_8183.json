When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It is also released to the environment in the exhaust of gasoline powered vehicles, during the combustion of plastics, and from natural plant species such as chamise, whitethorn, and valley oak. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.0159 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-dodecene will exist solely in the vapor phase. Vapor-phase 1-dodecene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 23 hr. If released to soil, 1-dodecene is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 5900. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.3 atm-cu m/mole but this maybe attenuated by adsorption. 1-Dodecene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 1-dodecene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.8 and 120 hr, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediments in the water column. An estimated BCF of 310 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Occupational exposure to 1-dodecene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-dodecene is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 1-dodecene via inhalation of ambient air, by ingestion of contaminated drinking water, and exposure to natural products and some agricultural food products.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.25 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.3 hr and 120 hr, respectively, but these rates are expected to be attenuated by adsorption(SRC). The half-life for volatilization from a model pond, which takes into account adsorptive processes, is 17 months(8,SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 310(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 6.10(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Pure culture studies indicate that 1-dodecene has the potential to biodegrade under aerobic conditions in water(9-11), but the rate of biodegradation is unknown.",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 1-dodecene is expected to volatilize rapidly from moist soil and water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 1.324 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 120 hours(SRC). However, the volatilization half-life does not take into account the effects of adsorption. An estimated Koc of 5900 (SRC), from a log Kow of 6.10 (SRC) and a regression-derived equation (3), suggests that volatilization could be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediments in water (SRC). This is apparent from the results of two EXAMS model runs, one in which the effect of adsorption was considered, yielding an estimated half-life of 39 days in a model pond 2 m deep, and one in which the effect of adsorption was ignored, yielding an estimated half-life of 45 hr in a model pond 2 m deep (4). 1-Dodecene's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces will occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 1-dodecene from dry soil surfaces is not expected(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 0.0159 mm Hg 25 \u00b0C(SRC).",

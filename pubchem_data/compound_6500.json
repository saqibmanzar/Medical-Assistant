The toxicokinetics of the enantiomers of tabun were investigated in anesthetized swine after intravenous administration of 3xLD50 (161.4 ug/kg) tabun. Blood samples were taken for gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric determination of the tabun enantiomers and for measurement of the activity of red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The tabun enantiomers could be quantified in swine blood to a minimum concentration of 3.0 pg/mL (18.5pM) and could be detected to a minimum concentration of 1.0 pg/mL (6.2pM). The concentration-time profiles of both tabun enantiomers were best described by a bi-exponential equation. The elimination of (+)-tabun and (-)-tabun were comparable in the initial phase. In the terminal phase a remarkable difference was found, with terminal half lives of 11.5 min for (+)-tabun and 23.1 min for (-)-tabun. (+)-Tabun showed a markedly longer persistence in vivo than (+)-enantiomers of other G-type nerve agents and could be detected in all swine at least up to 30 min post-injection, (-)-tabun at least up to 90 min post-injection. These results demonstrate a rather rapid elimination of tabun enantiomers in vivo and may provide a toxicokinetic basis for the further development and optimization of medical countermeasures against this nerve agent.",

                        "Description": "In medicine, the term \"mechanism of action\" (also called MOA) is used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The rate of spontaneous reactivation of AChE is variable, which partly accounts for differences in acute toxicity between the nerve agents. With soman in particular, an additional reaction occurs known as 'aging'. This consists of monodealkylation of the dialkylphosphonyl enzyme, which is then resistant to spontaneous hydrolysis and reactivation by oximes. Monodealkylation occurs to some extent with all dialkylphosphonylated AChE complexes; however, in general, is only of clinical importance in relation to the treatment of soman poisoning, where it is a very serious problem. With soman, aging occurs so fast that no clinically relevant spontaneous reactivation of AChE occurs before aging has taken place. Hence, recovery of function depends on resynthesis of AChE. As a result, it is important that an oxime is administered as soon after soman exposure as possible so that some reactivation of AChE occurs before all the enzyme becomes aged. Even though aging occurs more slowly and reactivation occurs relatively rapidly in the case of nerve agents other than soman, early oxime administration is still clinically important in patients poisoned with these agents.",

By a mechanism of phosphorylation, nerve agents act as substrates for the enzyme thereby preventing deactivation of acetylcholine. The organophosphate-inhibited enzyme can be reactivated by dephosphorylation, but this occurs at a rate that is slower than the rate of reactivation of acetylcholine (deactivated by acetylcholinesterase). Consequently, there is a depletion of acetylcholinesterase and a buildup of acetylcholine. In addition, the nerve agent-enzyme complex can also undergo an 'aging' process (thought to be due to a loss of an alkyl or alkoxy group), whereby it becomes resistant to dephosphorylation... . Differences in rates of aging and reactivation may be important in evaluating toxicity data especially when extrapolating from animal studies to humans. In vitro tests ... indicate that both GA and GB combine with cholinesterase almost irreversibly during the first hour of their reaction. .... The GB-ChE complex ages very rapidly in vivo, with 45 to 70% completion by 5 hours after infusion. In contrast, the complex formed between ChE and the nerve agent VX does not age significantly, and the rate of spontaneous reactivation can be as fast as 1%/hr in humans.",

Nerve agents are part of a class known as organophosphorus compounds, and were first synthesized in 1854, but their development as warfare agents did not occur until 80 years later. The first military nerve agent, ethyl phosphorodimethylamidocyanidate, known as tabun, or chemical agent symbol GA, was synthesized in 1936 by Schrader while searching for more effective agricultural organophosphorate insecticides at the German chemical firm of IG Farbenindustrie. Two years later, he synthesized a second nerve agent, isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate, now known as Sarin or GB. In 1944, a third nerve agent, pinacolyl methylphosphonofuoridate, now known as Soman or GD, was synthesized.",

Source temp had a dramatic effect on the chemical ionization mass spectra acquired. Abundant (M + NH4)+ and (or) (M + H)+ quasimolecular ions were usually observed at lower source temps. for the selected cmpd under pos ion chemical ionization conditions, along with a number of characteristic fragmentation ions.

The CIRCLE CELL used a modified micro, high pressure, flow through sampling accessory fitted with a ZnSe internal reflection element. Peak heights were evaluated with the Nicolet SUPER QUANT programs after spectral subtraction of the solvent. The P:O stretching absorption band, centered around 1240/cm, produced good quantification in the concn range 0.5 to 2.0 mg/mL. In this concn range the intra-daily precision had a percent coefficient of variation of <3.0%, while the inter-daily precision yielded a percent coefficient of variation of <6.0%. The detection limit was 0.3 mg/mL for tabun and 0.2 mg/mL for sarin and soman.",

The time course of the reaction, monitored spectrophotometrically at 410 nm with and without various concentrations of the agent, is used to calculate the concentration of agent in the sample.",

OPC adducts of butyrylcholinesterase and albumin are considered to be valuable biomarkers for retrospective verification of OPC exposure. Therefore, we have detected and identified novel adducts of human serum albumin (HSA) by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Pure albumin and plasma were incubated with numerous pesticides and NA of the V- and G-type in different molar ratios. Samples were prepared either by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by in-gel enzymatic cleavage using endoproteinase Glu-C (Glu-C) or by combining highly albumin-selective affinity extraction with ultrafiltration followed by reduction, carbamidomethylation, and enzymatic cleavage (Glu-C) prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Characteristic mass shifts for phosphylation revealed tyrosine adducts at Y(411) (Y(401)KFQNALLVRY(411)TKKVPQVSTPTLVE(425)), Y(148) and Y(150) (I(142)ARRHPY(148)FY(150)APE(153), single and double labeled), and Y(161) (L(154)LFFAKRY(161)KAAFTE(167)) produced by original NA (tabun, sarin, soman, cyclosarin, VX, Chinese VX, and Russian VX) as well as by chlorpyrifos-oxon, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), paraoxon-ethyl (POE), and profenofos. MALDI-MS/MS of the single-labeled (142)I-E(153) peptide demonstrated that Y(150) was phosphylated with preference to Y(148). Aged albumin adducts were not detected. The procedure described was reproducible and feasible for detection of adducts at the most reactive Y(411)-residue (S/N > or = 3) when at least 1% of total albumin was labeled. This was achieved by incubating plasma with molar HSA/OPC ratios ranging from approximately 1:0.03 (all G-type NA, DFP, and POE) to 1:3 (V-type NA, profenofos). Relative signal intensity of the Y(411) adduct correlated well with the spotted relative molar amount underlining the usefulness for quantitative adduct determination. In conclusion, the current analytical design exhibits potential as a verification tool for high-dose exposure.",

These adducts may offer relatively long-lived biological markers of nerve agent exposure that do not 'age' rapidly, and which are not degraded by therapy with oximes. Sensitive methods for the detection of these adducts have been developed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Adducts of all four nerve agents were detected in the blood of exposed guinea pigs being used in studies to improve medical countermeasures. The tyrosine adducts with soman and tabun were detected in guinea pigs receiving therapy 7 days following subcutaneous administration of five times the LD50 dose of the respective nerve agent. VX also forms a tyrosine adduct in human blood in vitro but only at high concentrations.",

In addition, sarin, cyclosarin, soman and tabun have been shown to phosphylate a tyrosine residue in albumin. Therapies against nerve agent poisoning include the use of oximes to reactivate inhibited cholinesterases by displacement of the phosphyl moiety and hence detectable levels of adducts with cholinesterases may be reduced. Adducts with tyrosine have been shown to be persistent in the guinea pig in the presence of oxime therapy. Plasma samples obtained from an animal study aimed at improving therapy against nerve agent poisoning were used to compare the suitability of tyrosine and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) adducts as biomarkers of nerve agent exposure after treatment with therapeutic oximes. Under the terms of the project licence, these samples could be collected only on death of the animal, which occurred within hours of exposure or when culled at 23 or 24 days. Tyrosine adducts were detected in all samples collected following intra-muscular administration of twice the LD50 dose of the respective nerve agent. Aged BuChE adducts were detected in samples collected within a few hours after administration of soman and tabun, but not after 23 or 24 days. No BuChE adducts were detected in animals exposed to sarin and cyclosarin where samples were collected only after 23 or 24 days.",

Storage containers and parts of containers may rocket great distances, in many directions. If material or contaminated runoff enters waterways, notify downstream users of potentially contaminated waters. Notify local health and fire officials and pollution control agencies. From a secure, explosion-proof location, use water spray to cool exposed containers. If cooling streams are ineffective (venting sound increases in volume and pitch, tank discolors, or shows any signs of deforming), withdraw immediately to a secure position.

Two approaches to decontamination are feasible: the \"bucket and sponge\" method taking one patient at a time, or the mass decontamination approach with attendants supervising the passage of a queue of people through some communal shower unit. Patients who have been injured or are unable to help themselves should be decontaminated by trained attendants using a system in which a stretcher is placed on a table equipped with rollers that allows transfer of the decontaminated patient to a clean stretcher, and ambulance and to hospital. Some authorities have argued for the addition of liquid soap to the water used in automated decontamination units. This will speed the process of material but the interaction of water and soap leading to foaming when passed through a jet should be considered. Whatever means of decontamination are used it should be thorough. This means that each patient will need some minutes of attention: up to 15 or so minutes may be needed to deal with an incapacitated patient. Whatever system is used, plans for dealing with waste water and any decontaminants used should be devised and practiced in advance of an incident occurring. Waste water may be collected inside an area protected by inflatable \"bunds\". ...If waste water is to be allowed to run into drains, the local water company should be informed. ...Suitable towels and clothing must be provided, modesty should be preserved and consideration given to how people are to make their way home. /Chemical warfare agents/",

Respirators chosen initially for responders into a known release area should be a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with a Level A protective suit until monitoring results allow for other decisions. OSHA would generally require these respirators to be NIOSH-certified CBRN SCBA respirators for use by employees. Some chemical warfare agents have been shown to seriously degrade and damage some respirators. Respiratory protection specifically approved by NIOSH for CBRN exposures is highly desirable but where not available, the incident commander may allow alternative suitable respirators during emergency operations. These are, depending on exposure levels, other NIOSH approved SCBAs or full-face air purifying respirators, which have been specifically tested by the manufacturer as effective against chemical warfare agents. Respirators other than SCBAs may be selected based upon accurate monitoring results with appropriate limits of detection for the subject agent. When conditions have been determined to be appropriate for the use of air purifying respirators, a NIOSH-approved CBRN APR Full Facepiece Air Purifying Respirator (APR) with a CBRN Canister, or a Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA) tested full facepiece APR with a combination organic vapor/acid gas/particulate canister may be used.

The year 1925 saw the founding of I.G. Farben (Interessen-Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie AG), a conglomerate of companies that would monopolize the country's chemical production and come to own all its major pharmaceutical industries. During the World War II, I.G. Farben participated in numerous operations associated with the criminal activities of the Nazi executive, including the use of slave labor in plants built close to concentration camps, such as that at Auschwitz. With regard to medical and pharmacological research projects, I.G. Farben became involved in experimental programs using patients from the Nazi regime's euthanasia programs and healthy subjects recruited without their consent from concentration camps, on whom various pharmacological substances were tested, including sulfamide and arsenical derivatives and other preparations whose composition is not precisely known (B-1012, B-1034, 3382 or Rutenol, 3582 or Acridine), generally in relation to the treatment of infectious diseases, such as typhus, erysipelas, scarlet fever or paratyphoid diarrea. Furthermore, I.G. Farben played a decisive role in the German army's chemical warfare program, contributing to the development of the first two neurotoxic substances, later known as 'nerve agents', tabun and sarin. Some of these activities came to light as a result of the one the famous Nuremberg Trials in 1947, which saw 24 executives and scientists from I.G. Farben brought to justice for, among other offences, the use of slave labor in the concentration camps and forced experimentation with drugs on prisoners.",

To ensure that chemical contamination is reduced to safe concentrations at stockpile and NSCM sites before they are used for residential, occupational, or wildlife purposes, the U.S. Army requested that health-based exposure limits for GA, GB, GD, VX, sulfur mustard, and lewisite be developed to protect the public and the environment. The National Research Council subcommittee determined that the Army's interim RfDs for GA, GB, GD, and sulfur mustard were scientifically valid but concluded that the RfDs for VX and lewisite and the SF for sulfur mustard were too high.[Available from, as of July 3, 2007: http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=9644]",

The oximes HI-6, obidoxime, trimedoxime, K203 and KR-22836 were used as representative compounds of commonly available and new AChE reactivators. Besides the positive effect of the administered reactivators on blood AChE activity, the sizable modulation of low molecular weight antioxidant (LMWA) levels was also determined. The LMWA levels in the the animals treated with the oxime reactivators were decreased in comparison with the animals treated by atropine alone. It was found that the levels of LMWA returned to the level found in the control animals when either trimedoxime, K203 or KR-22836 were administered. ...",

Animals instrumented for electroencephalogram recording were pretreated with pyridostigmine bromide (0.026 mg/kg im) 30 min before challenge with 2 x LD50 (s.c.) of a nerve agent. In model A, atropine sulfate (2.0 mg/kg im) and pyridine-2-aldoxime methylchloride (2-PAM; 25.0 mg/kg im) were given 1 min after nerve agent challenge, and the tested anticonvulsant was given (im) 5 min after seizure onset. In model B, a lower dose of atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg im) was given along with 2-PAM 1 min after nerve agent challenge, and the anticonvulsant was given at seizure onset. With the lower dose of atropine, seizure occurrence increased to virtually 100% for all agents; the time to seizure onset decreased for sarin, cyclosarin, and VX; the signs of nerve agent intoxication were more severe; and coma resulted frequently with cyclosarin. The anticonvulsant ED50 doses for scopolamine or diazepam were, in general, not different between the two models, whereas the anticonvulsant ED50 values of midazolam increased 3- to 17-fold with the lower atropine dose. Seizure termination times were not systematically effected by the different doses of atropine. The order of anticonvulsant effectiveness within each model was scopolamine > or = midazolam > diazepam. The findings indicate that the dose of atropine given as antidotal therapy can significantly influence measures of nerve agent toxicity and responsiveness to anticonvulsant therapy.",

After baseline measurements the animals received tabun, 60, 180 or 300 ug/kg, and 2 min later the antidotes (all iv): obidoxine, HLo 7, or HI 6 (30 or 100 umol/kg, each) or atropine 10 mg/kg or a combination of atropine and one of the oximes. Respiratory and circulatory parameters were recorded for 60 min or until the death of the animal. Erythrocyte, brain and diaphragm AChE activity was determined in every animal after the experiment. Poisoning by tabun resulted in a rapid deterioration of respiratory function and respiratory arrest within 5 min. Atropine treatment was very effective in improving the respiratory function after tabun 60 ug/kg but was ineffective after tabun 300 ug/kg. However, circulatory parameters were restored almost completely in all atropine therapy groups. Therapy of tabun 300 ug/kg poisoned animals with atropine plus oxime (30 umol/kg) improved respiration to a variable extent and restored circulation.",

The trachea, a carotid artery and jugular vein were cannulated in female urethane-anesthetised Pirbright-white guinea-pigs. After baseline measurements the animals received pyridostigmine (0.05 umol/kg) and 30 min later atropine (29.5 umol/kg) plus obidoxime, HI 6 or HLo 7 (30 or 100 umol/kg) or tabun (1.85 umol/kg  = 5 x LD50) followed by oxime + atropine treatment (all iv). Erythrocyte, brain and diaphragm acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were determined. Similar groups without pretreatment were included for comparison. Pyridostigmine aggravated the oxime + atropine induced hypotension and prevented the increase in heart rate but not the respiratory stimulation. The pyridostigmine inhibited AChE recovered only in the 100 umol/kg oxime groups at the end of the experiment. In tabun poisoning, pyridostigmine reduced the oxime + atropine induced circulatory recovery and decreased the survival time and rate. It did not affect the therapeutic oxime + atropine effect on respiratory function. These results suggest that pyridostigmine enhances oxime + atropine related circulatory depression which may be the reason for the reduced efficacy of oxime + atropine treatment in tabun poisoning...",

Rescue and drug administration should be undertaken by trained staff that are protected by personal protective equipment and equipped with pressure demand, self contained breathing apparatus .... In addition, the use of small portable gas powered ventilators can assure a high quality of essential ventilatory care at the scene. The priority is to remove the casualty from further nerve agent exposure and to establish and maintain a clear airway; supplemental oxygen should be given as required. If possible, the victim's contaminated clothing should be removed to reduce further nerve agent absorption. ... Civilian casualties who have been exposed substantially to a nerve agent should receive antidotal treatment as soon as possible after exposure; the rapid parenteral administration of atropine to patients presenting with rhinorrhea and bronchorrhea may be life-saving. It is also recommended that casualties requiring atropine should also receive immediately whichever oxime is available. ... Severely intoxicated adult casualties may require the administration of the contents of three /autopen injections/ at 5-10 min intervals prior to admission to hospital. Casualties receiving antidotes should be moved to hospital as soon a possible. Casualties who do not develop the features of systemic toxicity, notably rhinorrhea and bronchorrhea, should be triaged but not given atropine or oxime. /Nerve agents/",

In the military context or with mass casualties, this can be done most conveniently by means of autoinjectors containing a cholinolytic such as atropine and an oxime. In addition a benzodiazepine may be administered separately or with the atropine/oxime combination. Sarin, cyclosarin and VX poisoning respond favorably to HI 6; tabun is notorious for producing poisoning which is quite resistant to oxime reactivation at the usual doses. Here, HI 6 is practically ineffective while trimedoxime and obidoxime may be of some value. The treatments of soman poisoning is particularly fraught with problems because of the rapid aging of human enzyme, and all oximes are therefore presumed to be of little value.",

Dial urethane anesthetized cats were infused with the nerve agents soman, sarin, tabun, or VX). Dose dependent alterations were noted in the activity of medullary respiratory related units, and were among the first indications of respiratory distress. Changes in phrenic nerve activity, diaphragm electromyography, diaphragm contraction, and airflow followed. Immediately after spontaneous respiration stopped, the phrenic nerve was stimulated with 2 millisec pulses of 500 msec duration at 10 Hertz and at 100 Hertz in order to test the diaphragm. A frequency following contraction was consistently produced by stimulation at 10 Hertz. A tetanic contraction followed stimulation at 100 Hertz. Since the diaphragm muscle still contracts tetanically on 100 Hertz challenge, the authors conclude that loss of central respiratory drive is the prime contributing factor to respiratory arrest.",

The LD50 was 0.287 mg/kg. Recovery of acetylcholinesterase activity in whole mouse brain after sub LD50 doses was slow and did not reach control values by 14 days after intravenous administration. Acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited in a dose dependent manner in whole mouse brain as well as in six brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain, medulla/pons, and cerebellum). None of these brain areas were particularly sensitive to acetylcholinesterase inhibition by the organophosphate compound. The EC50 was 0.188 mg/kg or 66% of the LD50.",

The inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, which is responsible for breaking down acetylcholine (ACh) at the synapse and neuromuscular junction, leads to a build-up of extracellular ACh and a series of toxic consequences including hypersecretion, tremor, convulsion/seizure, respiratory distress, coma, and death. This study employed simultaneous and continuous electroencephalographic recording and striatal microdialysis collection for quantification of ACh changes (via subsequent HPLC analysis) during acute exposure to a 1.0xLD50 subcutaneous dose of either cyclosarin or tabun to investigate differences in cholinergic and behavioral effects. Information about the unique mechanisms and consequences of different nerve agents is intended to aid in the development of broad-spectrum medical countermeasures for nerve agents. At the dose administered, non-seizure and sustained seizure responses were observed in both agent groups and in the tabun-exposed group some subjects experienced an unsustained seizure response. Significant extracellular ACh increases were only observed in seizure groups. Cyclosarin and tabun were found to exhibit some unique cholinergic and ictogenic characteristics. Lethality only occurred in subjects experiencing sustained seizure, and there was no difference in lethality between agent groups that progressed to sustained seizure.",

Enzyme activity of AChE was studied in selected structures of brain and in motor endplates in the diaphragm. Histochemical detection of AChE ...  with simultaneous histochemical detection of alkaline phosphatase in ...  brain sections was used. The highest activity of AChE in the control group was found in the striatum, amygdaloid nuclei, substantia nigra, superior colliculi, and motor nuclei of cranial nerves V, X a XII. LD50 /doses/ of both nerve agents dramatically decreased the activity of AChE in the structures studied--both brain and diaphragm. After intoxication by either agent, activity in above mentioned nuclei was characterized as low or focally moderate. Very low activity was seen in some structures (CA3 field of hippocampus, some nuclei of the tegmentum and cerebellar cortex). /The investigators/ found minimal differences in the histochemical picture of soman or tabun intoxication, apart from the striatum and the superior colliculi which showed stronger inhibition by tabun.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.07 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tabun will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tabun will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hours. The UV absorption spectrum of tabun does not exhibit absorption above 295 nm; therefore, tabun is not expected to degrade through direct photolysis in the environment. If released to soil, tabun is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 39. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-7 atm-cu m/mole and tabun's susceptibility to hydrolysis. Persistence depends on moisture and weather conditions. Liquid tabun may persist for 1 to 2 days under ambient weather conditions and it evaporates about 20 times more slowly than water. Field studies measuring the evaporation rate of tabun from soil found that 50% of applied tabun evaporated in 1.71 hr and that 90% evaporated in 4.66 hr. Several species of bacteria, such as Alteromonas sp. and Flavobacterium sp., are capable of degrading G-type nerve agents, but data are not available to assess the environmental importance of biodegradation. If released into water, tabun is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Tabun hydrolyzes in water at neutral or slightly acidic pH and more rapidly under strong acidic or alkaline conditions. The rate of hydrolysis also increases with increasing temperature. At neutral pH and 25 \u00b0C, tabun persists in water for 14 to 28 hours; the half-life at 20 \u00b0C and pH 7.4 is approximately 8 hours. The half-life in seawater at 20 \u00b0C is shorter (4.5 hours) than in  freshwater. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant and its hydrolysis in water. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to tabun may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tabun is produced or used. Exposure to tabun occurs through vapor contact which is readily absorbable through not only the lungs and eyes but also through the skin and intestinal tract. The general population will not be exposed to tabun unless it is used as a weapon; exposure to tabun, if used as a weapon, will be via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact. (SRC)",

Volatilization of tabun from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.07 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 9.8X10+4 mg/L(5). Hydrolysis in moist soil will attenuate the importance of volatilization under wet conditions(SRC). Persistence depends on moisture and weather conditions. Liquid tabun may persist for 1 to 2 days under average weather conditions and it evaporates about 20 times more slowly than water(2). In a Norwegian study, tabun was found to volatilize from snow slowly; tabun was present 2 weeks after being sprayed on snow, but was not measurable after 4 weeks(2). In another field study, the disappearance of tabun applied to snow found that <0.1% remained after 14 days(6). Tabun hydrolyzes in water at neutral or slightly acid pH and more rapidly under strong acid or alkaline conditions(7). Field studies measuring the evaporation rate of tabun at ambient temperatures from soil found that 50% of applied tabun evaporated in 1.71 hr and that 90% evaporated in 4.66 hr(8). Several species of bacteria, such as Alteromonas sp. and Flavobacterium sp. are capable of degrading G-type agents(9), but data are not available to assess the environmental importance of biodegradation(SRC).",

Tabun hydrolyzes in water at neutral or slightly acid pH and more rapidly under strong acid or alkaline conditions(2). The rate of hydrolysis also increases with increasing temperature(2). At neutral pH and 25 \u00b0C, tabun persists in water for 14 to 28 hours; the half-life at 20 \u00b0C and pH 7.4 is approximately 8 hours. The half-life in seawater at 20 \u00b0C is shorter (4.5 hours) than in freshwater(2). Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.07 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 9.8X10+4 mg/L(5) and tabun's susceptibility to hydrolysis. According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Several species of bacteria, such as Alteromonas sp. and Flavobacterium sp. are capable of degrading G-type agents(7), but data are not available to assess the environmental importance of biodegradation(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 8 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Tabun hydrolyzes in water at neutral or slightly acid pH and more rapidly under strong acid or alkaline conditions(2). The rate of hydrolysis also increases with increasing temperature(3). At neutral pH and 25 \u00b0C, tabun persists in water for 14 to 28 hours; the half-life at 20 \u00b0C and pH 7.4 is approximately 8 hours. The half-life in seawater at 20 \u00b0C is shorter (4.5 hours) than in freshwater(3). The aqueous hydrolysis half-life of tabun in seawater has been experimentally measured to be 475 min at 15 \u00b0C, 267 min at 20 \u00b0C, and 175 min at 25 \u00b0C(4). The decomposition time required for 99.9% decomposition in seawater is 213 hr at 5 \u00b0C, 79 hr at 15 \u00b0C, 45 hr at 20 \u00b0C, and 29 hr at 25 \u00b0C(4). The decomposition time required for 99.9% decomposition in distilled water is estimated to be 140 hr at 5 \u00b0C, 42 hr at 15 \u00b0C, 22 hr at 20 \u00b0C, and 14 hr at 25 \u00b0C(4); the solution of tabun in water is rapid, hence, the controlling factor in aqueous contact is the hydrolysis rate(4). The splitting off of the cyanogen group(5) and an attack on the P-N bond(6) causes a great decrease in toxicity of aqueous solutions of tabun(5,6). Hydrolysis products under neutral conditions are O-ethyl N,N-dimethylamido phosphoric acid and hydrogen cyanide(3). The initial reaction of O-ethyl N,N-dimethylamido phosphoric acid to dimethyl phosphoramidate is faster than to phosphoric acid(3). The UV absorption spectra of tabun in cyclohexane solution does not exhibit any absorption above 295 nm(7); therefore, tabun is not expected to degrade through direct photolysis in the environment(SRC).",

Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that tabun is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water surfaces(3). Tabun's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to occur(SRC). In addition, any volatilization from moist soil would be attenuated by hydrolysis(SRC) since tabun hydrolyzes in water(1). Liquid tabun may persist for 1 to 2 days under average weather conditions and evaporates about 20 times more slowly than water(1). In a Norwegian study, tabun was found to volatilize from snow slowly; tabun was present 2 weeks after being sprayed on snow, but was not measurable after 4 weeks(1). Field studies measuring the evaporation rate of tabun from soil found that 50% of applied tabun evaporated in 1.71 hr and that 90% evaporated in 4.66 hr(4).",

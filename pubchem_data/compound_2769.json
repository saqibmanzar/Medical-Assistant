PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Cisapride stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. Cisapride increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder. Cisapride does not induce muscarinic or nicotinic receptor stimulation, nor does it inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The pharmacokinetics of cisapride were studied in the lamb, the pregnant ewe, and the fetus by obtaining blood samples from chronically implanted arterial catheters. Comparable pharmacokinetic parameters were found in the lamb and the adult sheep: half-life, 1.39-1.83 hr; total plasma clearance, 1998-2160 ml/kg/hr; AUC, 92.6-100.1 ng.hr/ml. Cisapride plasma concentrations after continuous infusion were predicted correctly based on the parameters obtained after IV bolus. There was a materno-fetal transfer of cisapride following a single IV bolus administered to the mother. Cisapride crossed the placenta within 5 min and equilibrated with maternal plasma within 20 to 30 min after dosing. The average fetal-to-maternal plasma concentration ratio was 0.71. The amniotic fluid also contained measurable amounts of cisapride. The protein binding of cisapride in maternal and fetal plasma is 89.0% and 88.4%, respectively; the free fraction is 4 times larger than in humans. Cisapride crosses the ovine placental barrier. The sheep placenta is less permeable than the human placenta, but the higher free fraction of cisapride facilitates placental transfer.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

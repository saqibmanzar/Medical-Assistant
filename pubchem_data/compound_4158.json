                                            "String": "Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant used most commonly in the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and for narcolepsy. Also known as the marketed products Ritalin, Concerta, or Biphentin, methylphenidate is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD: moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, [DB01576], and [DB01255] are considered the most effective and widely used treatment for ADHD, and are considered first-line options for children, adolescents, and adults as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance). CADDRA recommends the use of methylphenidate due to long term studies, of over twenty years in duration, which show methylphenidate is safe and effective.    While its exact mechanism is unclear, methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to act as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), thereby increasing the presence of these neurotransmitters in the extraneuronal space and prolonging their action. There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation, where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DA neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects. The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory. Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity. Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action.  When provided as Biphentin\u00ae, methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect for 10-12 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD impairment might occur (such as school, homework periods, during the work day, etc).  When provided as Concerta\u00ae, methylphenidate is released through the patented Osmotic Controlled-Release Oral Delivery (OROS) system where 22% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 78% is provided through a gradual release. OROS is comprised of an osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. Within an aqueous environment, such as the stomach, the drug overcoat, which consists of 22% of the dose, dissolves within one hour, providing an initial immediate-release formulation of methylphenidate. Water then permeates through the membrane into the tablet core where the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, allowing methylphenidate to release slowly through the orifice over a period of 6-7 hours. Concerta also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect, allowing for once-daily dosing.  Methylphenidate contains a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. This abuse potential is likely related to the effects associated with higher doses of methylphenidate, which induce surface expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT). In particular, increased dopamine in key brain areas is associated with the reinforcing and addictive properties of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects. Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DAT and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including [DB00289] and [DB01018].",

It is a central nervous system stimulant used most commonly in the treatment of attention-deficit disorders in children and for narcolepsy. Its mechanisms appear to be similar to those of dextroamphetamine. Methylphenidate blocks dopamine uptake in central adrenergic neurons by blocking dopamine transport or carrier proteins. Methylphenidate acts at the brain stem arousal system and the cerebral cortex and causes increased sympathomimetic activity in the central nervous system. Alteration of serotonergic pathways via changes in dopamine transport may result.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Following oral administration of Concerta, plasma methylhphenidate concentrations reach an initial maximum at about 1 hour followed by gradual ascending concentrations over the next 5-9 hours. Mean times to reach peak plasma concentrations across all doses of Concerta occurred between 6-10 hours. Once daily dosing minimizes the fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with multiple doses of immediate-release methylphenidate treatments. Depending on the doses provided, Cmax was found to range from 6.0-15.0ng/mL, Tmax ranged from 8.1-9.4h, and AUC ranged from 50.4-121.5 ng\u00b7h/mL in children.  When provided as Concerta\u00ae, methylphenidate is released through the patented Osmotic Controlled-Release Oral Delivery (OROS) system where 22% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 78% is provided through a gradual release. OROS is comprised of an osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. Within an aqueous environment, such as the stomach, the drug overcoat, which consists of 22% of the dose, dissolves within one hour, providing an initial immediate-release formulation of methylphenidate. Water then permeates through the membrane into the tablet core where the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, allowing methylphenidate to release slowly through the orifice over a period of 6-7 hours. Concerta also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect, allowing for once-daily dosing.  Biphentin\u00ae: Methylphenidate is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration, with peak blood levels obtained in 1-3 hours.  When provided as Biphentin\u00ae, methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect for 10-12 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD impairment might occur (such as school, homework periods, during the workday, etc).  Methylphenidate (immediate release): Methylphenidate hydrochloride is rapidly and extensively absorbed from the tablets following oral administration; however, owing to extensive first-pass metabolism, bioavailability is low (approx. 30%) and large individual differences exist (11-52%). In one study, the administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride with food accelerated absorption but had no effect on the amount absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations of 10.8 and 7.8 ng/mL were observed, on average, 2 hours after administration of 0.30 mg/kg in children and adults, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations showed marked variability between subjects. Both the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) showed dose-proportionality.",

Maximal methylphenidate concentrations in plasma were found to occur 2.2 hours after administration of either dose. The mean maximal concentration in plasma for methylphenidate was 3.5 ng/mL after 0.15 mg/kg, and 7.8 ng/mL after 0.3 mg/kg. Methylphenidate clearances were high (10.1 L/hour/kg) and variable (range: 3.6-23.2) for the 0.3 mg/kg dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters for children receiving 0.3 mg/kg were essentially the same as for the adults. Ritalinic acid plasma levels were 50-100 times greater than methylphenidate levels in normal adults. The clearance of ritalinic acid is less than that of methylphenidate. When admin to the rat, the absolute bioavailability of methylphenidate was found to be 0.19 in the rat and 0.22 in the monkey, suggesting substantial presystemic elimination of methylphenidate.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation, where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DE neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects. The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory. Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity.  Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action.",

Myocardial ischemia, infarction and ventricular dysfunction are described. CNS effects include: stimulation of CNS, tremor, restlessness, agitation, insomnia, increased motor activity, headache, convulsions, coma and hyperreflexia.  Stroke and cerebral vasculitis have been observed. Gastrointestinal effects include: vomiting, diarrhea and cramps.  Genitourinary effects include: increased bladder sphincter tone which may cause dysuria, hesitancy and acute urinary retention. Renal failure can occur secondary to dehydration or rhabdomyolysis. Renal ischemia may be noted. Transient hyperthyroxinemia may be noted. Increased metabolic and muscular activity may result in hyperventilation and hyperthermia. Weight loss is common with chronic use. Hypo- and hyperkalemia have been reported. Dehydration is common. Fasciculations and rigidity may be noted. Rhabdomyolysis is an important consequence of severe poisoning. Agitation, confusion, mood elevation, increased wakefulness, talkativeness, irritability and panic attacks are typical. Chronic abuse can cause delusions and paranoia. A withdrawal syndrome occurs after abrupt cessation following chronic use. Appears to exert most or all of its effect in the CNS by causing release of biogenic amines, especially norepinephrine and dopamine, from storage sites in nerve terminals. It may also slow down catecholamine metabolism by inhibiting monoamine oxidase. Does not appear to be a human teratogen. Mild withdrawal symptoms may be observed in the newborn, but the few studies of infant follow-up have not shown long-term sequelae, although more studies of this nature are needed.  Illicit maternal use or abuse presents a significant risk to the fetus and newborn, including intrauterine growth retardation, premature delivery and the potential for increased maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity. Cerebral injuries occurring in newborns exposed in utero appear to be directly related to the vasoconstrictive properties of the drug. ANIMAL STUDIES:  In 2 years feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of methylphenidate hydrochloride in male or female rats receiving 100, 500 or 1,000 ppm. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of methylphenidate hydrochloride in male or female mice based on the occurrence of hepatocellular neoplasms. In the squirrel monkey methylphenidate produced modest increases in masked auditory thresholds.",

In addition, there have been several case reports of marked serum enzyme elevations with jaundice and clinically apparent acute liver injury attributed to methylphenidate given intravenously. These cases occurred largely after illicit intravenous use of methylphenidate and frequently in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis C. The onset was generally soon after initiation of therapy. The pattern of liver enzyme elevations was hepatocellular and the clinical phenotype typical of acute hepatic necrosis with rapid onset and rapid recovery. Immunoallergic features were uncommon. A single case associated with low levels of autoantibodies has been published. Some cases have been severe and at least one fatality after intravenous abuse has been reported. Recurrence upon rechallenge was been documented in one instance (Case 1).",

Sertraline was started for depression at 50 mg daily and increased to 100 mg daily along with haloperidol 0.5 mg daily. After 12 weeks of therapy, inattentiveness at school and headaches prompted a change from the OROS product to a modified-release methylphenidate product (brand not specified) at 30 mg daily, then increasing to 50 mg daily. Three days after the increase in dosage, the girl had spontaneous milk flow from both breasts and subsequently had an elevated serum prolactin of 67.7 mcg/L. Methylphenidate and haloperidol were discontinued, but sertraline was continued. One week later, galactorrhea resolved completely. Fifteen days after drug discontinuation, the girl's prolactin level was in the normal range at 19.4 mcg/L.",

A transdermal (skin) patch called Daytrana\u00ae is approved for children and adolescents.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take your medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.",

However, ADHD persists into adulthood in 45.7% of cases. The global prevalence of adult ADHD is estimated to 5.3%, with no difference between Europe and North America. ADHD is often comorbid with substance use disorder (SUD), with Odds Ratio ranges from 1.5 to 7.9, depending on the substance and the dependence level. Conversely, the prevalence of ADHD among patients with SUD is 10.8%, versus 3.8% for patients without SUD. Methylphenidate (MPH) alleviates ADHD symptoms and, as such, is currently considered as a first choice medication. MPH blocks the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters leading to an increase in extracellular dopamine. It should be noted that its subjective effects are highly dependent on the pharmacokinetic and especially on the rate of input, which highlights the importance of choosing a sustained-release formulation. Meanwhile, prescribing MPH to patients with comorbid SUD has always been challenging for clinicians. The aim of this review is to address the benefits and pitfalls of using MPH in adults with ADHD comorbid SUD, depending on each of the following types of SUD: amphetamine, cocaine, nicotine, alcohol, cannabis and opiates. Overall, due to the prevalence of ADHD in SUD and to the benefits of MPH observed in this population, and considering the mild or low side effects observed, the response to MPH treatment should be evaluated individually in adults with comorbid ADHD and SUD. The choice of the formulation should favor sustained- release MPH over immediate release MPH. Cardiovascular parameters also have to be monitored during long-term use.",

This dose is approximately 30 times and 2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, respectively. Hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare rodent malignant tumor type. There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors. The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors, and the significance of these results to humans is unknown.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.9X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methylphenidate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases phase in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase methylphenidate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be one hour. Particulate-phase methylphenidate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Methylphenidate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methylphenidate is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1600. The pKa of methylphenidate is 8.9, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.9X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Methylphenidate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, methylphenidate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant half-lives of 23 and 2.3 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively, suggest that hydrolysis may be a slow environmental fate process. Occupational exposure to methylphenidate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methylphenidate is produced or used. The general public is not likely to be exposed to methylphenidate unless by direct medical treatment and via ingestion from abuse of this drug. (SRC)",

Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). A pKa of 8.9(5) indicates methylphenidate will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 0.20(7) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant half-lives of 23 and 2.3 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(2), suggest that hydrolysis may be a slow environmental fate process.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

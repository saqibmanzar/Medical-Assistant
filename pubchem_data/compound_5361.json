PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

An activator of both the rabbit skeletal muscle RyR1 and sheep cardiac RyR2 isoform ryanodine receptor channels, it has been used for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis for over 100 years. It has a role as a ryanodine receptor agonist, a GABA-gated chloride channel antagonist, a GABA antagonist, an apoptosis inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, an angiogenesis inhibitor, a purinergic receptor P2 antagonist, an EC 2.7.11.13 (protein kinase C) inhibitor, an antinematodal drug and a trypanocidal drug. It is a member of phenylureas, a secondary carboxamide and a naphthalenesulfonic acid. It is functionally related to a naphthalene-1,3,5-trisulfonic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a suramin(6-).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

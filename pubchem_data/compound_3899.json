When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Its mechanism of action in suppressing inflammation is based in its inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme responsible for de novo synthesis of pyrimidine containing ribonucleotides. It is the first disease-modifying antirheumatic drug approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with an indication for retardation of joint damage by radiography. Side effects are generally mild and include diarrhea, rashes, reversible alopecia, and elevation of hepatic transaminases. Despite the concern about hepatotoxicity, combination use with methotrexate in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis has been shown to be safe. Other autoimmune diseases in which leflunomide has been used successfully include Felty syndrome, vasculitis, Sjogren syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, and bullous pemphigoid.",

We used leflunomide in four consenting renal allograft recipients with symptomatic CMV disease, who were unable to afford ganciclovir and would otherwise remain untreated. This is the first report of efficacy of leflunomide in humans with CMV disease. They received loading dose of 100 mg of leflunomide once daily on days 1-3 and then 20 mg once daily for 3 months. All four patients were followed up three times weekly with physical examination, total leukocyte counts, blood urea and serum creatinine for a minimum period of 6 weeks. None of the patients showed drug related adverse events, alteration in cyclosporine levels, or decreased graft function, except one who developed leucopenia. Preliminary data presented suggests that leflunomide therapy for CMV disease is effective and could be used with careful monitoring in allograft recipients who cannot afford intravenous ganciclovir therapy. The duration of treatment and the role of leflunomide in secondary prophylaxis and in situations of ganciclovir resistance need to be studied further.",

Fifteen days later she developed diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes. A liver biopsy showed a pattern of acute hepatitis. The patient was homozygous for the rare CYP2C9*3 allele, which determines the slowest metabolic rate for CYP2C9 enzymatic activity, that is probably involved in the metabolism of leflunomide. Liver damage subsided in few weeks. This case illustrates the risk of hepatotoxicity by leflunomide and suggests that it is possibly related to CYP2C9 polymorphism.",

RA is an auto-immune disease characterized by high T-cell activity. T cells have two pathways to synthesize pyrimidines: the salvage pathways and the de novo synthesis. At rest, T lymphocytes meet their metabolic requirements by the salvage pathway. Activated lymphocytes need to expand their pyrimidine pool 7- to 8-fold, while the purine pool is expanded only 2- to 3-fold. To meet the need for more pyrimidines, activated T cells use the de novo pathway for pyrimidine synthesis. Therefore, activated T cells, which are dependent on de novo pyrimidine synthesis, will be more affected by leflunomide's inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase than other cell types that use the salvage pathway of pyrimidine synthesis.",

In vitro studies were conducted to characterize drug-metabolizing enzyme(s) responsible for ring opening and to gain insight into the mechanism of ring opening. ...  Although A771726 formation in human liver microsomes or recombinant p4501A2 required NADPH, its formation was greatly reduced by oxygen or carbon monoxide, suggesting that the isoxazole ring opening was catalyzed by the p450Fe(II) form of the enzyme. A mechanism for the p450-mediated ring scission is proposed in which the isoxazole ring nitrogen or oxygen coordinates to the reduced form of the heme followed by charge transfer from p450Fe(II) to the C=N bond or deprotonation of the C3-H, which results in a cleavage of the N-O bond.",

This metabolite is responsible for essentially all of the drug's activity in-vivo. The mechanism of action of leflunomide has not been fully determined, but appears to primarily involve regulation of autoimmune lymphocytes. It has been suggested that leflunomide exerts its immunomodulating effects by preventing the expansion of activated autoimmune lymphocytes via interferences with cell cycle progression. In-vitro data indicates that leflunomide interferes with cell cycle progression by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (a mitochondrial enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate (rUMP)synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity. Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase consists of 2 domains: an \u03b1/\u03b2-barrel domain containing the active site and an \u03b1-helical domain that forms a tunnel leading to the active site. A77 1726 binds to the hydrophobic tunnel at a site near the flavin mononucleotide. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by A77 1726 prevents production of rUMP by the de novo pathway; such inhibition leads to decreased rUMP levels, decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and G1 cell cycle arrest. It is through this action that leflunomide inhibits autoimmune T-cell proliferation and production of autoantibodies by B cells. Since salvage pathways are expected to sustain cells arrested in the G1 phase, the activity of leflunomide is cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. Other effects that result from reduced rUMP levels include interference with adhesion of activated lymphocytes to the synovial vascular endothelial cells, and increased synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). Leflunomide is also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases activate signalling pathways leading to DNA repair, apoptosis and cell proliferation. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases can help to treating cancer by preventing repair of tumor cells.",

In this study, we examined the effect of A771726 /active metabolite of leflunomide/ on osteoclast formation and bone-resorbing activity in vitro, using cultures of bone marrow-derived osteoclast progenitors and purified functionally mature osteoclasts, and then we elucidated the molecular mechanism of action of the effect of A771726 on osteoclasts. A771726 inhibited osteoclast formation from macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-dependent osteoclast progenitors in the presence of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) ligand (RANKL), without any other types of cells present, in a dose-related manner, similar to the inhibition in cultures of unfractionated bone marrow cells. In addition, A771726 suppressed bone resorption by isolated mature osteoclasts. These results indicate that A771726 directly and intrinsically inhibited the differentiation and function of osteoclast lineage cells without any mediation by other cells. The inhibition by A771726 was not restored by the simultaneous addition of uridine, and may be independent of the blockade of NF-kappaB activation and the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. Thus, leflunomide, through its active metabolite, has the potential to prevent bone loss by directly inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function. This inhibition suggests a novel mechanism for leflunomide in the retardation of the joint destruction observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients.",

This is called the background risk.Animal studies have suggested that leflunomide can increase the chance of birth defects. Case reports and studies on leflunomide exposure in pregnancy in humans have not found an increased chance of birth defects. Most people in these studies and reports stopped taking leflunomide very early in pregnancy once they found out they were pregnant and received washout treatment to remove the medication from the body more quickly. It is hard to know from these studies and reports how leflunomide might affect a pregnancy that is exposed to the medication for a longer period. Case reports and two small studies of people with longer exposures to leflunomide in pregnancy have not suggested an increased chance of birth defects.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.25X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates leflunomide will exist in the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor phase leflunomide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.2 days. Particulate-phase leflunomide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, leflunomide is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2,300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.23X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, leflunomide is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Biodegradation data were not available. An estimated BCF of 15 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to leflunomide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where leflunomide is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to leflunomide via ingestion of pharmaceutical products containing leflunomide. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

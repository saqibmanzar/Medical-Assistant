An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Myelosuppression, especially thrombocytopenia, was the major systemic toxicity and limited the infusion period to nine to 14 days. However, bone marrow recovery occurred within seven to ten days, allowing for a second infusion in most patients. Local toxicity (within the radiation field) was minimal, with the exception of one of four patients, who underwent abdominal irradiation. Pharmacology studies revealed a steady-state arterial plasma level of 6 X 10-7 mol/L and 1 X 10-6 mol/L during infusion of 650 and 1,000 mg/sq m/d, respectively. In vivo BUdR uptake into normal bone marrow was evaluated in two patients by comparison of preinfusion and postinfusion in vitro radiation survival curves of marrow CFUc with enhancement ratios (D0-pre/D0-post) of 1.8 (with 650 mg/sq m/d) and 2.5 (with 1,000 mg/sq m/d). In vivo BUdR incorporation into normal skin and tumor cells using an anti-BUdR monoclonal antibody and immunohistochemistry was demonstrated in biopsies from three patients revealing substantially less cellular incorporation into normal skin (less than 10%) compared with tumor (up to 50% to 70%). We conclude that local and systemic toxicity of continuous infusion of BUdR at 1,000 mg/sq m/d for approximately two weeks is tolerable. The observed normal tissue toxicity is comparable with our previous clinical experience with intermittent (12 hours every day for two weeks) infusions of BUdR. Theoretically, a constant infusion should allow for greater incorporation of BUdR into cycling tumor cells and thus, for further enhancement of radiosensitization.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

This effect was dramatically potentiated by AT-binding ligands such as distamycin A, netropsin, and Hoechst 33258. The genes most remarkably affected by these ligands include the widely used senescence-associated genes and were located on or nearby Giemsa-dark bands of human chromosomes. /The authors/ hypothesize that AT-rich scaffold/nuclear matrix attachment region sequences are involved in this phenomenon. In fact, upon substitution of thymine with 5-bromouracil, a rat S/MAR sequence reduced its degree of bending and became insensitive to cancellation of the bending by distamycin A. The S/MAR sequence containing 5-bromouracil also bound more tightly to nuclear scaffold proteins in vitro and this binding was not inhibited by distamycin A. Under the same conditions, the S/MAR sequence containing thymine easily dissociated from the nuclear scaffold proteins. Taken together, the synergistic induction of the genes may be explained not only by opening of condensed chromatin by distamycin A but also by increase in the binding of 5-bromouracil-containing S/MAR sequences to the nuclear scaffolds.",

The transgene was also activated to various degrees by inhibitors of histone deacetylase, DNA topoisomerases, or DNA methyltransferase. The peptide antibiotic distamycin A potentiated markedly the effect of 5-bromodeoxyuridine. Transient expression of an artificial AT-hook protein termed MATH20 also potentiated its effect although significantly activated the transgene alone. Since distamycin A and MATH20 are able to displace histone H1 and other DNA-binding proteins bound to specific AT-rich sequences by a dominant, mutually exclusive fashion, these results suggest that 5-bromodeoxyuridine targets such an AT-rich sequence located adjacent to the silenced transgene, resulting in chromatin accessibility.",

To assess this phenomenon at the level of gene expression, /the authors/ constructed a PCR-based subtractive cDNA library enriched for mRNA species that immediately increase by administration of BrdU to HeLa cells. Candidate cDNA clones were isolated by differential colony hybridization, and then positive clones were identified by Northern blot analysis. Sequencing analysis revealed that the identified cDNA species were classified into three groups: widely used senescence-markers, known species whose relevance to senescence is yet to be reported, and known or novel ESTs.

These results suggest that similar mechanisms operate in the regulation of BrdU-induced genes and senescence-associated genes.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

At a fixed concentration of BrdUrd and BCNU, the greatest cell loss was observed in exponentially growing cells. As cells approached plateau growth, cytotoxicity was reduced as indicated by greater cell viability. Under varying growth conditions the percentage of thymine replacement by bromouracil in DNA, as determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, declined as cultures approached maximum density. These data indicate BrdUrd must be incorporated into DNA for the enhanced effect to be observed. In exponentially growing cells, sensitization was dependent upon both the concentration of BrdUrd and alkylating agent. Using regression analysis (at 95% CL), a relationship between the level of bromouracil in DNA and the extent of enhanced cytotoxicity was observed at two concentrations of BCNU (r2 = 0.99, 0.96). Although it is known that bifunctional alkylating agents exert cytotoxicity by forming cross-links between cDNA strands, increased cross-link formation was not observed in BrdUrd substituted DNA as determined by alkaline elution. The data suggest that DNA damage induced by halogenated pyrimidines may not involve interstrand cross-links and that these agents may be useful in the treatment of glioma in combination with alkylating agents.",

At least 29 genes were found to alter gene expression greater than twice more or less than controls within 36 h after addition of BrdU. They took several different expression patterns upon addition of BrdU, and the majority showed a significant alteration within 12 hr. When compared among SUSM-1, HeLa, and TIG-7 normal human fibroblasts, 19 genes behaved similarly upon addition of BrdU. In addition, 14 genes, 9 of which are novel as regards senescence, behaved similarly in senescent TIG-7 cells. The genes do not seem to have a role in proliferation or cell cycle progression. These results suggest that the early BrdU-responsive genes represent early signs of cellular senescence and can be its new biomarkers.",

To examine the cause of baseline SCEs more broadly, the frequencies of SCEs, as well as chromosomal aberrations (CAs) in 4 additional BS fibroblast strains were compared, under different assay and cell culture conditions, with those of normal cells in the range of approximately 0.9-90% 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) substitution into template DNA. SCEs at low levels of BrdUrd substitution were detected by an extremely sensitive immunofluorescent technique. From approximately 0.9% to 4.5% BrdUrd substitution, the SCE frequency in BS cells remained constant, at a level (40/cell) 8 times higher than that of normal cells. As BrdUrd substitution increased further, the SCE frequency in BS cells increased almost linearly, reaching 70-100 per cell at approximately 90% substitution, while the SCE increment in control fibroblasts was less than 5 per cell. Analysis of SCEs in 3 successive replication cycles similarly revealed that the SCE increment in BS cells depended on BrdUrd only at a high BrdUrd substitution level. In contrast to data on SCEs, CA induction by incorporated BrdUrd in BS cells was only slightly higher than that in normal cells. Thus, BS cells are extremely sensitive to BrdUrd for SCE induction, but much less so for CA induction.",

Intraperitoneal injections of BrdU (500 mg/kg body weight) were given on days 11 and 12 to some pregnant mice and on days 12 and 13, and days 11, 12 and 13 to others. Evaluation of craniofacial relations and palate development in BrdU-treated mice revealed inhibition of vertical development of the palatal shelves, mandibular hypoplasia which led to failure of downward displacement of the tongue and the creation of an obstacle to reorientation of the palatal shelves. The results of this study demonstrate a strong correlation between induction of cleft palate and the presence of structural alterations in the mandible, and the mechanism of BrdU-induced cleft palate resembles the defect in the Pierre Robin anomaly.",

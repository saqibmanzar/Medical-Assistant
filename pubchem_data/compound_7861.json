When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

For the analysis of solid waste, a representative sample (solid or liquid) is collected in a standard 40 ml glass screw-cap VOA vial equipped with a Teflon-faced silicone septum.

Two VOA vials are filled per sample location, then placed in separate plastic bags for shipment and storage. Samples can be analyzed by direct injection or purge-and trap gas chromatography. A temperature program is used in the gas chromatograph to separate the organic compounds.

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Copolymers are used in coatings and lacquers, as a modifier for alkyl, polystyrene and ionomer resins, and as a plasticizer for nitrocellulose and adhesives. HUMAN STUDIES: There are no data available. ANIMAL STUDIES: Vinyl methyl ether does not produce inflammatory changes in either the skin or eyes of rabbits. Rats tolerate repeated inhalation of 2000 ppm. In two 28-day inhalation studies in rats restlessness, reduction in body weight gain and an increase in relative weight of the liver were observed at 25,000 ppm. In the male rats, an increase in prothrombin time and a reduction in total protein occured at higher concentrations. In the 28-day inhalation study, 1500 ppm was the no effect level for male rats and 3500 ppm for female rats. Methyl vinyl ether was not mutagenic on Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537, and Escherichia` coli WP2 uvrA with or without metabolic activation. In the micronucleus test in mice, vinyl methyl ether did not produce a clastogenic effect following 5 exposures of 25,000 ppm.",

Mutagenicity tests of 14 compounds and 1,3-butadiene on S. typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537, and E. coli WP2 uvrA were also examined by the developed gas exposure method. 1,3-Butadiene, propyne (methyl acetylene), monochlorodifluoromethane, ethylchloride, diborane and silane were mutagenic. 1-Butene, 2-butene, 2-methylpropene, methyl vinyl ether, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane, 1,1-difluoroethane and phosphine were not mutagenic on S. typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537, and E. coli WP2 uvrA with or without metabolic activation. These results were compatible with a previous report, and this developed method has the advantage that it can be tested easily and safely for combustible and self-combustible substances such as 1,3-butadiene and silane.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1316 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates vinyl methyl ether will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase vinyl methyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 11 hours and 1.3 days, respectively. Vinyl methyl ether does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, vinyl methyl ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.9X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Vinyl methyl ether is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, vinyl methyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected based on hydrolysis half-lives of 9.5 hours, 40 days and 10.9 years at pH 5, 6 and 9, respectively, for structurally similar butyl vinyl ether. Occupational exposure to vinyl methyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where vinyl methyl ether is produced or used. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 3 days, respectively(SRC).

Gas-phase vinyl methyl ether is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone(SRC); the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 11 hours and 1.3 days(SRC), calculated from its respective rate constants of 3.35X10-11(3) and 8.8X10-16(4) cu cm/molecule-sec. Vinyl methyl ether does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

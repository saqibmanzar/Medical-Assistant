When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Lipase was used as catalyst to degrade polymers with molecular weight of more than 100,000, and the molecular weight of products ranged from hundreds to thousands. Thermal decomposition temperatures of all products were below 250 \u00b0C. The degradation products of both PBS/CHDM and PBS/DGA showed two melting points at about 85 and 99 \u00b0C. Mass spectrometry (MS) was employed to obtain the molecular weight of oligomers extracted from the products, which proved to be low-polyesters with the molecular weight of less 1,000. The butanediol (BDO) monomer was found in PBS/CHDM degradation product... /Polybutylene succinate/",

The approximate dose levels achieved were 0, 256, 479 and 861 mg/kg-bw/day in males and 0, 385, 854 and 1360 mg/kg-bw/day in females. One male and one female from the high dose group were euthanized in extremis during the pre-mating period. High-dose animals (gender not specified) exhibited bloody or discolored urine, reductions in body weights and weight gains and decreased feed consumption. These signs persisted through lactation in females. Decreased food consumption during lactation days 0-4 was observed in mid-dose females. No treatment-related effects were seen in organ weights harvested and histologically examined. There was no treatment-related effect on epididymal or testicular sperm counts. A decrease in sperm motility was noted in some males at the highest dose. This effect was not statistically significant, but was considered to be biologically significant. There were no reductions in any of the fertility parameters or indices examined. Biologically significant changes in litters were only noted in pups from high dose dams. These pups exhibited decreased body weights and weight gains as well as decreased postnatal survival between days 0 and 4. The incidence of pups with no or small amounts of milk in their stomachs, and pups that were either missing (presumably cannibalized) or found dead was also higher from dams exposed to higher doses. No treatment-related effects were noted in the two lower dose groups in the reproductive parameters assessed (reproductive performance, gestation length, pup survival rate, prenatal loss, number of implantation sites, number of live and dead pups, pup sex ration, body weights and weight gains). The fetotoxicity noted occurred at levels that induced significant maternal toxicity. LOAEL (systemic toxicity, male) = 861 mg/kg-bw/day (based on bloody or discolored urine, reductions in body weights and weight gains and decreased feed consumption) LOAEL (systemic toxicity, female) = 1360 mg/kg-bw/day (based on bloody or discolored urine, reductions in body weights and weight gains and decreased feed consumption) NOAEL (systemic toxicity, male) = 479 mg/kg-bw/day NOAEL (systemic toxicity, female) = 854 mg/kg-bw/day LOAEL (developmental toxicity) = 1360 mg/kg-bw/day (based on decreased fetal weight and postnatal survival) NOAEL (developmental toxicity) = 854 mg/kg-bw/day LOAEL (reproductive toxicity) > (highest dose tested) NOAEL (reproductive toxicity) = 1360 mg/kg-bw/day",

As with most any polymer, the monomers along with the high molecular weight oligomers, whose toxicity is most commonly represented by the monomers, make up the predominate amount of free chemicals available for leaching into the environment and/or foods. In light of the high level of public concern about the presence of endocrine (primarily estrogenic) activity ascribed to certain plastics and chemicals in the environment, Tritan's monomers were evaluated using QSAR for binding to the androgen receptor and estrogen receptors (alpha and beta) as well as a battery of in vitro and in vivo techniques to determine their potential androgenicity or estrogenicity. The findings were universally negative. When these data are coupled with other in vivo data developed to assess systemic toxicity and developmental and reproductive toxicity, the data clearly indicate that these monomers do not pose an androgenic or estrogenic risk to humans. Additional data presented also support such a conclusion for terephthalic acid (TPA). TPA is also a common polyester monomer and is the main mammalian metabolite formed from DMT. /Tritan copolyester/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.08X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 hours. Particulate-phase 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 1,4-Cyclohexanedimethanol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces may not be an important fate process based upon its vapor pressure. Using the OECD-302B method (Zahn-Wellens/EMPA test for inherent biodegradability), 98% of initial 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol was degraded over a 19-day incubation period which classified the compound as inherently biodegradable. If released into water, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol is produced or used. Limited population exposure may occur via ingestion of and dermal contact with contaminated water in the vicinity of a spill site. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

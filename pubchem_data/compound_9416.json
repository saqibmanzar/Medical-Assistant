In 2017, about 6.5 million retail prescriptions for testosterone therapy were filled. The majority of the prescriptions written were for injectable (66%) and topical (32%) testosterone products. As recent as 1 October 2018, the US FDA approved Antares Pharma Inc.'s Xyosted - a subcutaneous testosterone enanthate product for once-weekly, at-home self-administration with an easy-to-use, single dose, disposable autoinjector. As the first subcutaneous autoinjector product designed for testosterone replacement therapy, this innovative formulation removes transfer concerns commonly associated with testosterone gels and potentially reduces the need for in-office/in-clinic injection procedures that may inconvenience patients with frequent visits to the clinic.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Some of the treated conditions are 1) primary hypogonadism, defined as testicular failure due to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome or orchidectomy; 2) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to an idiopathic gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone deficiency or due to a pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma or radiation, in this case it is important to accompany the treatment with adrenal cortical and thyroid hormone replacement therapy; 3) to stimulate puberty in patients with delayed puberty not secondary to a pathological disorder. If the conditions 1 and 2 occur prior to puberty, the androgen replacement therapy will be needed during adolescent years for the development of secondary sexual characteristics and prolonged androgen treatment might be needed it to maintain sexual characteristics after puberty.  In females, testosterone enanthate is indicated to be used secondarily in presence of advanced inoperable metastatic mammary cancer in women who are from one to five years postmenopausal. It has also been used in premenopausal women with breast cancer who have benefited from oophorectomy and are considered to have a hormone-responsive tumor.  Testosterone enanthate injections that are currently formulated for subcutaneous use are specifically indicated only for primary hypogonadism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The use of such formulations is limited because the safety and efficacy of these subcutaneous products in adult males with late-onset hypogonadism and males less than 18 years old have not yet been established. Moreover, subcutaneously administered testosterone enanthate is indicated only for the treatment of men with hypogonadal conditions associated with structural or genetic etiologies, considering the medication could cause blood pressure increases that can raise the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events like non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death.",

Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing androgen effects.  Such activities are useful as endogenous androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of the prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution.  Male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion of testosterone, has two main etiologies. Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (FSH, LH).",

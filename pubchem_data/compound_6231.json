For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

In 2 prospective, randomized studies, nausea and vomiting were less common with a high-dose postcoital progestin-only regimen (0.75 mg levonorgestrel every 12 hours for 2 doses) than with a high-dose estrogen-progestin regimen (100 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 0.5 mg levonorgestrel every 12 hours for 2 doses). Other adverse GI effects include vomiting, abdominal cramps, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Gingivitis and dry socket have also been reported.

Acne may improve during oral contraceptive therapy because of decreased sebum production and depression of sebaceous gland activity; however, it may increase in severity during initial therapy and may develop in some women who have not previously had acne. Other dermatologic reactions include allergic rash, urticaria, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, hemorrhagic eruption, and pruritus. Hirsutism and alopecia have also occurred.

After oral administration, norethisterone acetate and ethynodiol diacetate are rapidly converted to norethisterone by esterases during hepatic first-pass metabolism. Although less is known about the transformation of lynestrenol and norethynodrel, it appears that lynestrenol first undergoes hydroxylation at carbon 3 and then oxidation of the hydroxyl group to form norethisterone. Although there is no convincing evidence for the in-vivo transformation of norethynodrel to norethisterone, data from receptor binding tests and bioassays suggest that norethynodrel is also a pro-drug.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

The estrogen acts mainly by suppressing secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), resulting in prevention of follicular development and the rise of plasma estradiol concentration which is thought to be the stimulus for release of luteinizing hormone (LH). In combination products, the progestin appears to act mainly by inhibiting the preovulatory rise of LH. Long-term administration of these combination products results in inhibition of both FSH and LH secretion. It has been suggested that oral contraceptives may also produce a direct effect on ovarian steroidogenesis or the response of the ovary to gonadotropins. In addition, changes in the cervical mucus may prevent sperm penetration; however, further studies are required to determine the precise effects of estrogen-progestin combinations on sperm activity.",

Two different estrogen receptors (ER), alpha and beta, have been cloned with a specific tissue distribution. Active estrogen as well as active progestin are compounds of oral hormonal contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. To examine the regulation of ER-alpha and -beta activities after treatment with synthetic progestins and synthetic and natural estrogens, COS 7 cells were transfected with the vector expressing ER-alpha and -beta in combination with a luciferase reporter vector. ER-alpha activity was upregulated in the presence of synthetic progestins in a dose-dependent manner. Norethisterone, norethynodrel and desogestrel proved to be the most potent stimulatory agents of ER-alpha expression. On the other hand, not all progestins exhibited a stimulatory action on ER-beta activity. Only norgestrel, levonorgestrel, norethynodrel and norethisterone induced ER-beta-activating functions in a dose-dependent manner. Luciferase activity due to estrogen stimulation served as a positive control. These results indicate that progestins have different effects on the activities of ER-alpha and -beta.",

We show that in T47-D human breast cancer cells, progesterone induces a dose-dependent increase of 3-4-fold in media VEGF levels, with a maximum response occurring at a concentration of 10 nM. This effect is blocked by the antiprogestin RU 486. In addition to progesterone, a number of synthetic progestins used in oral contraceptives (eg, norethindrone, norgestrel, and norethynodrel), hormone replacement therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate), and high-dose progestin treatment of breast cancer (megestrol acetate) also increase VEGF in the media of cultured T47-D cells. This effect is hormone specific and is not produced by estrogens, androgens, or glucocorticoids. Collectively, these observations suggest that the increase in VEGF caused by progestins is mediated by progesterone receptors present in T47-D cells. The induction of VEGF by progestins is also cell type specific and does not occur in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75, or MDA-MB-231, nor in Ishikawa cells derived from a human endometrial carcinoma. ...",

It has been reported that 17alpha-ethynylestradiol decreases plasma PAF-AH activity and medroxyprogesterone increases the enzyme activity. In this study, /investigators/ elucidated the effects of various progestins on plasma PAF-AH activity and lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Plasma PAF-AH activity in female adult rats treated with either progesterone or 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (50 mg/kg, 3 days) did not change significantly. Both medroxyprogesterone and megestrol acetate (50 mg/kg, 3 days) significantly increased plasma PAF-AH activity, but both norethindrone acetate and norethynodrel (50 mg/kg, 3 days) significantly decreased the enzyme activity. In addition, not only did medroxyprogesterone increase plasma PAF-AH activity but plasma lipoprotein cholesterol and norethindrone acetate decreased both of them. A significant correlation between plasma PAF-AH activity and the lipoprotein level was found (r = 0.974, p < 0.01). When PAF (10 nmol/kg) was administered to female adult rats pretreated with progestins, the mortality of the rats that had low plasma PAF-AH activity due to norethindrone acetate was increased in the same manner as observed in the 17alpha-ethynylestradiol-pretreated group. These findings indicate that progestins have various effects on plasma PAF-AH activity and the lipoprotein level. In addition, some progestins, which have an estrogenic effect on enzyme activity, may be related to the thrombotic episodes observed in oral contraceptive users.",

Data from the subset of women who intended to breastfeed for 3 months or longer postpartum during their third trimester of pregnancy and who were using a contraceptive at 3 months postpartum were analyzed (n = 1349). Women who intended to breastfeed for at least 4 months and were taking a progestin-only oral contraceptive, such as norethynodrel, were 3.15 times more likely to be breastfeeding (exclusive or nonexclusive) at 4 months than women who used a nonhormonal contraceptive. Women who said they would breastfeed for 3 to 4 months had 4-month breastfeeding rates equivalent to those using a nonhormonal contraceptive. These rates were much higher than those of women who were taking an estrogen-containing, combined oral contraceptive.",

At 2 months postdelivery she began taking estro-progesterone. She was given Enidrel R (norethynodrel 4.925 mg, mestranol .075 mg) for 18 months and then Ovariostat (lynestrenol 2.5 mg, mestranol .075 mg). Her blood pressure was not recorded until 2 years later when it was 180 mm Hg systolic. Contraceptive therapy was then stopped. A month later pregnancy occurred. At that time her blood pressure was 120 mm Hg. The delivery was normal. 4 months later she began taking Ovariostat again. Headaches soon developed and her blood pressure was found to be 270/150 mm Hg. On admission to the hospital 3 weeks later her blood pressure was 250/100 mm Hg. Renal failure was present. Creatinine clearance was 12 mL/minute. No cause for this hypertension was found. 1 month later hypertension was 210/160 mm Hg. Retinal hemorrhaging had lessened but azotemia persisted. Heart failure and oliguria followed. Dialysis was done weekly. A bilateral nephrectomy was done. Microscopic study of renal tissue showed malignant nephroangiosclerosis. After 10 days her blood pressure was 150/100 mm Hg. Her general condition improved. A salt-free diet was prescribed. Blood pressure subsided to 140/80 mm Hg before dialysis. A renal graft was done and 10 months later blood pressure was normal. These hypertensions are usually benign and subside when the contraceptive therapy is discontinued. When estrogen-progesterones are prescribed, blood pressures should be recorded frequently and therapy stopped if hypertension arises.",

Another patient has worn a cast for fracture until 3 weeks prior to admission. Although no local signs of thrombophlebitis were elicited, x-ray of the chest showed a pleural effusion considered typical of pulmonary infarction.

Although cigarette smoking alone has been associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disorders, concomitant cigarette smoking and oral contraceptive use is associated with a greater risk of these disorders than either alone. The relative risk of thrombotic stroke has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users of oral contraceptives to 14 for users with hypertension. The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 in nonsmoking women who use oral contraceptives, 2.6 in nonusers who do not smoke, 7.6 in users who smoke, 1.8 in normotensive users, and 25.7 in users with severe hypertension.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.0X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates norethynodrel will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase norethynodrel will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Norethynodrel does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, norethynodrel is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4,100. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Norethynodrel may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, norethynodrel is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 97 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions.Occupational exposure to norethynodrel may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where norethynodrel is produced or used. Exposure to norethynodrel via ingestion will occur when administered drugs containing this compound. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to norethynodrel at well below the therapeutic dose via ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks in direct contact with flames. For massive fire, use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2024)",

Some workers complained of sleepiness and headache in the evening after work; occasional nausea and vomiting were experienced. Complaints of irritation of the conjunctiva were not confirmed by examination. Routine blood and urine clinical analyses were normal. Some symptoms of exposure (headache, coughing, pharyngitis) were related to air concentrations of 4 ppm measured with a personal monitoring device. However, when exposure concentrations were below 1.4 ppm, no signs or symptoms of butyl lactate exposure occurred, and medical examinations were negative.",

No evidence of teratogenicity or maternal toxicity was observed in an inhalation (2-ethylhexyl-l-lactate) or dermal study (ethyl-l-lactate). Subacute inhalation studies have been conducted at concentration up to 600 mg/cu m or higher on four lactate esters (ethyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, and 2-ethylhexyl-l-lactate). Degenerative and regenerative changes in the nasal cavity were noted in all studies. The NOAEL in ethyl, n-butyl, and isobutyl-l-lactate vapor studies was 200 mg/cu m. For aerosol exposure, 2-ethylhexyl-l-lactate, the most toxic of the lactates, minimal damage to the nasal epithelium was noted at 75 mg/cu m with vapor being slightly less toxic than the aerosol. Lactates do not appear to cause systemic toxicity, except at very high concentrations (1800 mg/cu m or higher). These systemic effects may be secondary to severe irritation seen at high doses. Sensory irritation tests suggest that a vapor exposure limit of 75 mg/cu m ( approximately 15 ppm) should prevent irritation in humans and therefore an occupational exposure level for vapor of 75 mg/cu m is recommended. However, aerosol exposure should be kept as low as possible. The low vapor pressure of the higher molecular weight esters would tend to keep vapor exposure low and the odor of lactate esters serves as a warning of exposure. These lactate esters are readily biodegradable, suggesting little concern from an environmental point of view.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.4 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates n-butyl lactate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-butyl lactate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.5 days. n-Butyl lactate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, n-butyl lactate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. n-Butyl lactate may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using the Closed Bottle test, n-butyl lacate exhibited 22-39% degradation in 5 days, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, n-butyl lactate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 23 and 170 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis half-lives of 85 and 8.5 days at pH 7 and 8, respectively, have been estimated. Occupational exposure to n-butyl lactate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-butyl lactate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-butyl lactate via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing n-butyl lactate. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

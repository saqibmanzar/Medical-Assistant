PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

                        "Description": "In medicine, the term \"mechanism of action\" (also called MOA) is used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

They can be classed in three groups. 1) Veratridine, cevadine and protoveratrines A and B cause the membrane to depolarize. The potency decreases in that order, and the concentrations of veratridine and cevadine required for 50% maximum depolarization are estimated to be 3.3 x 10-5 M and 3.7 x 10-3 M, respectively. The depolarization by veratridine is due primarily to a selective increase in resting sodium permeability of time membrane and is antagonized by tetrodotoxin. All of them are effective in augmenting and prolonging the negative (depolarizing) afterpotential. 2) Veratramin, eisorubijervine, muldaimine (5-veratranine 3-beta, 11-alpha-diol-11-acetate) and 5-veratranine-3alpha-11alpha-diol (1x10-4) re capable of blocking the action potential with little or no depolarization. 5-Veratranine-3-beta, 11-alpha-diol blocks both sodium and potassium conductance increases. 3) Cyclopamine, jervine, rubijervine and veratrosine have no effect on the resting and action potentials. Possible structure-activity relationships for these effects are discussed.",

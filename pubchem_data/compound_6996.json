PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

CS-hydrolysis to 2-chlorobenzaldehyde and malononitrile occurs both in vitro and in vivo. No quantitative data have thus far been reported with respect to the percutaneous absorption and the cutaneous biotransformation of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde. Percutaneous absorption, biotransformation and elimination of (14)C-labeled 2-chlorobenzaldehyde was investigated in the rat. Following IV (25 uL/kg) and IP (37.5 uL/kg) (14)C-2-chlorobenzaldehyde administration to rats, the plasma radioactivity declined rapidly over a 24 hr period with similar plasma radioactivity-time profiles. Following cutaneous administration (75 uL/kg) in a closed glass-cup on the skin a slow skin penetration occurred as indicated by plasma radioactivity levels. A slow increase in plasma radioactivity was followed by a slow decline of radioactivity in plasma over a 3-day period. Most of the radioactivity was found in the urine with low levels in feces and exhaled air. The cutaneously administered radioactivity was also partly recovered from the glass-cup. For the qualitative and quantitative determination of metabolites in urine, a thin layer chromatography-radioautography method was used. The metabolic patterns of urinary excreted metabolites following cutaneous application and systemic administration of (14)C-2-chlorobenzaldehyde to rats were very similar. No parent compound was recovered from the rat urine. 2-Chlorohippuric acid was the principal urinary metabolite. Quantitatively, the urinary excretion of (14)C-2-chlorobenzyl alcohol following cutaneous application differed substantially from that after the systemic administration. There was no evidence of storage in the skin or skin toxicity of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde following cutaneous application.",

These acids were identified as N-acetyl-S-(ortho-substituted benzyl)cysteines (I, II, III). The total mercapturic acid excretion as % dose (2.0 mmol/kg, n = 4) was 1.2 +/- 0.4, 6.8 +/- 0.9, and 10.4 +/- 2.0 for V, VI, and VII. p-Cl-benzaldehyde administered in the same dose showed a non-significant urinary thioether excretion. The aim of the investigation was to prove in vivo a postulated metabolic pathway of substituted benzaldehydes via sulfate esters to mercapturic acids. After a single administration of the sodium salts of o- and p-Cl-benzylsulfuric acid a significant increase in mercapturic acid excretion of 21.2 +/- 1.8% and 14.5 +/- 1.2% of dose (2.0 mmol/kg, n = 4) was found. By pretreatment with pyrazole the mercapturic acid excretion increased after administration of o-Cl-benzyl alcohol (IX) whereas a significant decrease was found after administration of o-Cl-benzaldehyde (VI). After simultaneous administration of ethanol with IX and VI an increase in mercapturic acid excretion was observed. After previous administration of pentachlorophenol a significant decrease in urinary mercapturic acid excretion for IX and VI was found. These findings are in accordance with a metabolic pathway of substituted benzaldehydes via benzyl alcohols, subsequently sulfate esters to the corresponding benzylmercapturic acids.",

CS hydrolysis to 2-chlorobenzaldehyde and malononitrile occurs both in vitro and in vivo. Main metabolic pathways of CS in rabbits were estimated quantitatively following iv administration. The products of hydrolysis were o-chlorobenzaldehyde and malononitrile. The toxic actions of CS can be ascribed to o-chlorobenzaldehyde. O-chlorobenzaldehyde showed negative responses in yeast when it was tested for genotoxicity without metabolic activation.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.230 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates o-chlorobenzaldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase o-chlorobenzaldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 22 hours. o-Chlorobenzaldehyde contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, o-chlorobenzaldehyde is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 97. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. o-Chlorobenzaldehyde has a vapor pressure of 0.230 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, o-chlorobenzaldehyde may volatilize from dry soil. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 8% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks. Utilizing Zahn-Wellens inherent biodegradability tests, o-chlorobenzaldehyde reached 90-100% biodegradation in 13-15 days. These tests suggest that under certain environmental conditions biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, o-chlorobenzaldehyde is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 30 hours and 18 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 16 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to o-chlorobenzaldehyde may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where o-chlorobenzaldehyde is produced or used. Use data as a commercial chemical intermediate indicate that the general population will have limited or no exposure to o-chlorobenzaldehyde. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                                "Description": "This section provides information on the density (with unit) and specific gravity (without unit) of a compound. Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Acute inhalation exposure may result in hoarseness, laryngitis, a feeling of suffocation, dyspnea (shortness of breath), choking, respiratory tract irritation, chest pain, and pulmonary edema. Sneezing, bleeding of the nose and gums, and ulceration of the nasal and oral mucosa may also occur. Renal toxicity has been observed in animals. If the eyes have come in contact with methyltrichlorosilane, then irritation, pain, swelling, corneal erosion, and blindness may result. Dermatitis (red, inflamed skin), severe burns, pain, and shock generally follow dermal exposure.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The compounds were tested with and without S-9 activation. Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 1538, TA 98, and TA 100 were used for reverse mutation assays according the method of Ames. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D4 provided a parallel for the Ames mutation assay in diploid eukaryotic cells. The Escherichia coli pol-A repair assay tested for chemically induced DNA damage using the mutant strain P3078. Tissue culture assays were performed using Fischer L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells. The test compounds included hydrochloric acid, trimethylchlorosilane, trimethylsilanol, dimethyldichlorosilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane, methyltrichlorosilane, methyltriethoxysilane, silicon tetrachloride, hexamethyldisiloxane, silane hydrolysate, hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane. None of the organosilicon test compounds produced any significant increase in the incidence of reverse mutation, mitotic recombination, or DNA damage as assessed by the microbial assays, nor did any agent produce a significant increase in mutant colonies in the mouse lymphoma studies. Dose related increases in sister chromatid exchanges were observed for trimethylsilanol without S-9 activation, methyltriethoxysilane with S-9 activation, and for dimethyldiethoxysilane, methyltrichlorosilane, silicon tetrachloride, and hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane in the presence and absence of S-9. Dose related increases in chromosome aberrations were observed after treatment with trimethylchlorosilane in the absence of S-9 and after trimethylsilanol and dimethyldichlorosilane with and without S-9. /It was/ concluded that none of the compounds tested are mutagenic although some exhibit in vitro clastogenic activity.",

The test compounds included methyltrichlorosilane, dimethyldichlorosilane, trimethylchlorosilane, trimethylsilanol, hexamethyldisiloxane, and hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (541059). Male Sprague-Dawley-rats received intraperitoneal injections of the test chemicals, and bone marrow samples were collected at 6, 24, and 48 hours. Chromosomes were prepared using standard air drying methods.  Confirmatory bone marrow chromosome assays and the dominant lethal test were used to evaluate the in-vivo clastogenic potential of trimethylsilanol. Chromosomes were harvested after intraperitoneal injections of the agent at concentrations of 300, 400, and 500 mg/kg, and a 9 week dosing schedule prior to mating was used for the dominant lethal study.  No significant, dose related increase in chromosome damage was observed for any of the agents tested.  Simple chromatid gaps and breaks were the predominant type of damage.  Neither the bone marrow chromosome assay nor the dominant lethal test revealed any clastogenic activity for trimethylsilanol.  The authors conclude that all the agents tested lack clastogenic activity.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 167 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyltrichlorosilane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyltrichlorosilane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 36 days. Methyl silanes are transparent to UV radiation >290 nm and therefore methyltrichlorosilane is not expected to undergo direct photolytic degradation. All silicon chlorides are immediately and completely hydrolyzed and methyltrichlorosilane has been reported to hydrolyze instantaneously releasing hydrochloric acid. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces, adsorption to soil and sediment, as well as biodegradation, are not expected to be important fate processes when compared to rapid hydrolysis in water. Methyltrichlorosilane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Due to the rapid hydrolysis, bioconcentration of methyltrichlorosilane is not expected. Occupational exposure to methyltrichlorosilane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyltrichlorosilane is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

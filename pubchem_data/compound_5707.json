Xylazine is not approved for human use and requires a veterinary licence for its purchase and use. The intentional and unintentional use of xylazine is a cause for concern due to its side effects. The use of xylazine can lead to hypotension and bradycardia, and when combined with central nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol, it can significantly depress vital functions and increase the risk of overdose and death. Xylazine is sometimes used as an adulterant and combined with opioids and recreational drugs; however, it has no antidote, and the use of [naloxone] has no effect on xylazine.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

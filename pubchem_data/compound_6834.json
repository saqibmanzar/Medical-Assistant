PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There is limited evidence of efficacy for these preparations in this age group, and appropriate dosages (i.e., approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) for the symptomatic treatment of cold and cough have not been established. Therefore, FDA stated that nonprescription cough and cold preparations should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age; the agency continues to assess safety and efficacy of these preparations in older children. Meanwhile, because children 2-3 years of age also are at increased risk of overdosage and toxicity, some manufacturers of oral nonprescription cough and cold preparations recently have agreed to voluntarily revise the product labeling to state that such preparations should not be used in children younger than 4 years of age.  Because FDA does not typically request removal of products with previous labeling from pharmacy shelves during a voluntary label change, some preparations will have the new recommendation (\"do not use in children younger than 4 years of age\"), while others will have the previous recommendation (\"do not use in children younger than 2 years of age\"). FDA recommends that parents and caregivers adhere to the dosage instructions and warnings on the product labeling that accompanies the preparation if administering to children and consult with their clinician about any concerns. Clinicians should ask caregivers about use of nonprescription cough and cold preparations to avoid overdosage."

In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H<sub>1</sub>-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Brompheniramine is a histamine H1 antagonist (or more correctly, an inverse histamine agonist) of the alkylamine class. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The antihistamine effect of brompheniramine, as determined by suppression of the wheal and flare responses induced by intradermal administration of histamine, appears to be maximal within 3-9 hours after a single oral dose of the drug, but suppression of the flare response may persist for up to at least 48 hours; the antipruritic effect appears to be maximal within 9-24 hours.",

Brompheniramine and its metabolites are excreted principally in urine. About 40% of an oral dose of brompheniramine is excreted in urine and about 2% in feces within 72 hours in healthy individuals. In healthy individuals, about 5-10% of an oral dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug, 6-10% as monodesmethylbrompheniramine, 6-10% as didesmethylbrompheniramine, small amounts as the propionic acid derivative and its glycine conjugate, and the remainder as unidentified metabolites.",

Contraction of the sphincter of Oddi and bile duct may be mediated in part by H1-receptors, and opiate-induced contraction of biliary smooth muscle has been antagonized by antihistamines. The drugs only are feebly antagonistic to bronchospasm induced by antigen-antibody reactions. Antihistamines also effectively antagonize the action of histamine that results in increased capillary permeability and the formation of edema. H1-receptor antagonists also suppress flare and pruritus that accompany the endogenous release of histamine. Antihistamines appear to act by blocking H1-receptor sites, thereby preventing the action of histamine on the cell; they do not chemically inactivate or physiologically antagonize histamine nor do they prevent the release of histamine. Antihistamines do not block the stimulating effect of histamine on gastric acid secretion, which is mediated by H2-receptors of the parietal cells. /Antihistamine drugs/",

Treat coma, seizures, hyperthermia, and atypical ventricular tachycardia if they occur. Monitor the patient for at least 6 to 8 hours after ingestion.

However because antihistamine overdose carry a greater risk for seizures physostigmine is not recommended routinely. Sodium bicarbonate may be useful for myocardial depression ... . Decontamination: Administer activated charcoal orally if conditions are appropriate. Gastric lavage is not necessary after small to moderate ingestions if activated charcoal can be given promptly. Because of slowed gastrointestinal motility, gut decontamination procedures may be helpful even in late-presenting patients. Enhanced elimination: Hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, peritoneal dialysis, and repeat dose activated charcoal are not effective in removing antihistamines. /Antihistamines/",

The syndrome includes hallucinations, excitement, ataxia, incoordination, athetosis, and convulsions. Fixed, dilated pupils with a flushed face, together with sinus tachycardia, urinary retention, dry mouth, and fever, lend the syndrome a remarkable similarity to that of atropine poisoning. Terminally, there is deepening coma with cardiorespiratory collapse and death, usuallY within 2 to 18 hours. Treatment is along general symptomatic and supportive lines. /Histamine Antagonists: H1 Antagonists/",

Brompheniramine and dextromethorphan were 0.40 mg/L and 0.50 mg/L, respectively, in the blood sample and 0.16 mg/kg and 0.57 mg/kg in the liver sample. The concentration of pseudoephedrine in blood and liver specimens was measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and was determined to be 14.4 mg/L in the blood and 16 mg/kg in the liver. Additionally, a baby bottle allegedly administered to the infant was collected as evidence and sent to the Medical Examiner's Office for evaluation. The amounts of total brompheniramine, dextromethorphan, and pseudoephedrine remaining in the baby bottle were 1.4 mg, 9.4 mg, and 40 mg, respectively.",

The drugs detected were ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, brompheniramine, ethanol, carbinoxamine, levorphanol, acetaminophen, and the anti-emetic metoclopramide. Toxicology findings were confirmed in 2 different matrices in 9 of the 10 cases and by 2 different analytical methods. The blood concentrations of the drugs and the case histories, as well as the cause of death for each infant, if available, will be given. The majority of these deaths were either toxicity from the OTC cold medications directly or as a contributory factor in the cause of death. Only two of the cases were the result of possible child abuse. Caregivers may be under the mistaken notion that OTC cold medications formulated for children are also safe for use in infants. These cases demonstrate that not only is administration of some OTC cold medications not safe, but use of OTC cold medications in infants can result in toxicity that can lead to death.",

The Civil Aerospace Medical Institute's (CAMI's) Toxicology Database was examined for the presence of the first-generation antihistamines in pilot fatalities of civil aircraft accidents that occurred during a 16-yr (1990-2005) period. Of 5383 fatal aviation accidents from which CAMI received specimens, there were 338 accidents wherein pilot fatalities (cases) were found to contain brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, pheniramine, phenyltoloxamine, promethazine, and triprolidine. Of the 338 accidents, 304 were general aviation accidents, and 175 of the 338 pilots held private pilot airman certificates. Antihistamines were detected alone in 103 fatalities (1 antihistamine in 94 and 2 antihistamines in 9), while other drug(s) and/or ethanol were also present in an additional 235 fatalities. The antihistamines were found in approximately 4 and 11% of the fatalities/accidents in 1990 and in 2004, respectively. The use of antihistamine(s) was determined by the National Transportation Safety Board to be the cause of 13 and a factor in 50 of the 338 accidents. There was an overall increasing trend in the use of antihistamines by aviators during the 16-yr span. Blood levels of the antihistaminics were in the sub-therapeutic to toxic range.",

The cardiac electrophysiological effects of brompheniramine, a conventional antihistamine /were examined/. Brompheniramine was reported to prolong QT interval in isolated hearts. To evaluate the electrophysiological effects of brompheniramine, whole-cell patch clamp techniques in human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)-stably transfected CHO cells, the SCN5A sodium channel transiently transfected CHO cells, and rat myocytes and conventional microelectrode recording techniques in isolated guinea pig papillary muscles /were used/. As for the I(hERG), the IC(50) value of brompheniramine was found to be 0.90+/-0.14 uM with a Hill coefficient (n(H)) of 1.75+/-0.42. Action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) was slightly prolonged by brompheniramine at 10 and 100microM, but APD(50) was shortened by 100microM. Moreover, despite the potent hERG current block, reductions of the V(max) and total amplitude of action potential were observed at high concentrations of brompheniramine. The change in action potential parameters and poor correlations between hERG and APD assay indicated additional effects of brompheniramine on non-hERG channels. In agreement with this hypothesis, the inhibition of I(Na) (IC(50) values: 21.26+/-2.52 uM) and I(Ca) (IC(50) values: 16.12+/-9.43 uM) by brompheniramine was observed. ...",

Brompheniramine inhibited HERG current in a concentration-dependent manner with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 1.7 microm at 0 mV. A block of HERG current by brompheniramine was enhanced by progressive membrane depolarization and showed significantly negative shift in voltage-dependence of channel activation. Inhibition of HERG current by brompheniramine showed time-dependence. The S6 residue HERG mutant Y652A and F656C largely reduced the blocking potency of HERG current. ...",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

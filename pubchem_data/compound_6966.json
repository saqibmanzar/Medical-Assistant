The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Reports of the irritant effects and pulmonary edema have been extensive; some of the reports of pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and chemical pneumonitis may actually represent immune sensitization that was not evaluated. Immune sensitization, which has been studied only in the last 15 years, is probably the most important problem clinically. The first cases were probably reported in the 1940s, but there was no accompanying immunologic investigation. /Acid anhydrides/"

He was clinically diagnosed as having acute hemorrhagic alveolitis associated with anemia. The serologic analysis revealed a high concentration of IgG antibodies against pyromellitic acid dianhydride-treated human serum albumin (PMDA-HSA). Immunoblotting with PMDA-treated human serum as antigen and the patient's serum as the first antibody showed that additional PMDA-modified serum proteins other than HSA were recognized by the patient's IgG antibodies in the higher mol. mass range (>67 kDa). No specific IgG could be detected against other anhydride conjugates (maleic acid, MA; phthalic acid, PA) with the exception of a reaction with the trimellitic acid anhydride-conjugated HSA (TMA-HSA). No specific IgE antibodies could be detected against any of the above mentioned antigens, but immunoblotting of the patient's serum indicated IgG4-type autoantibodies against in vitro PMDA-treated Ig molecules of normal serum proteins.",

FEV1 /(forced expiratory volume in 1 second)/ was measured as a base-line and after working with the adhesive. Skin tests to common allergens were performed on all subjects. Two subjects who stated they wheezed with adhesive had falls in FEV1 of 15% and 18% from base-line. Totally symptom-free subjects had falls of less than 4% from base-line or a rise in FEV1. There was no clear relationship between smoking habits or atopic state or skin rashes with resin and a fall in FEV1. There is no simple way to identify those at risk of developing wheeze. Care should be taken with epoxy adhesives to avoid sensitization and where it occurs a simple questionnaire would provide a screening method.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.8X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pyromellitic dianhydride will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase pyromellitic dianhydride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 56 days. Pyromellitic dianhydride is a hygroscopic substance that undergoes hydrolysis when contacted by moist air resulting in the formation of pyromellitic acid. Particulate-phase pyromellitic dianhydride that has not reacted with moist air or hydroxyl radicals will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, pyromellitic dianhydride is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 178. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.5X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, pyromellitic dianhydride is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. No biodegradation data were located for pyromellitic dianhydride, and it is expected that hydrolysis in moist soil and water will be the dominant fate process for this compound. The estimated hydrolysis half-life of this compound at pH 8 is about 9 days. An estimated BCF of 9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to pyromellitic dianhydride may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pyromellitic dianhydride is produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase pyromellitic dianhydride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 56 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.9X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Pyromellitic dianhydride is a hygroscopic substance that undergoes hydrolysis when contacted by moisture in the atmosphere resulting in the formation of pyromellitic acid(4). Unreacted particulate-phase pyromellitic dianhydride may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Pyromellitic dianhydride absorbs light greater than 290 nm and is susceptible to direct photolysis in the environment(5), but the kinetics of this reaction are not known.",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 56 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Pyromellitic dianhydride is a hygroscopic substance that undergoes hydrolysis initially forming the monohydride and subsequently pyromellitic acid when contacted by moist air(2); however the rate of this reaction was not quantified. The second order base catalyzed rate constant of pyromellitic dianhydride was estimated as 0.868 l/mol-sec using an estimation method based on perturbed molecular orbital theory and linear free energy relationship (LFER) methods(3). This corresponds to a half-life of about 9 days at pH 8(SRC). Pyromellitic dianhydride absorbs light greater than 290 nm and is susceptible to direct photolysis in the environment(4), but the kinetics of this reaction are not known.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Pyromellitic dianhydride is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 4.8X10-6 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3).",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

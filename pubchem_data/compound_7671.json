When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

N-Phenylformamide's production and former use as an analgesic and antipyretic may have resulted in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.57X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates N-phenylformamide will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase N-phenylformamide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 hours. If released to soil, N-phenylformamide is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 100. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.45X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, N-phenylformamide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. N-Phenylformamide, present at 20 mg/l in water, eliminated 100% of dissolved organic carbon in 4 weeks using the modified OECD screening test. Therefore, this compound may be expected to biodegrade in the environment. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. N-Phenylformamide is expected to undergo slow chemical hydrolysis; its hydrolysis half-life in water ranges from 29-146 days. Occupational exposure to N-phenylformamide may have occurred through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N-phenylformamide was produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.45X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 2(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). N-Phenylformamide is expected to undergo slow chemical hydrolysis(7). The hydrolysis half-life in water at 55 \u00b0C and pH 5-9 has been estimated to be on the order of 29-146 days(7). N-Phenylformamide, present at 20 mg/l, eliminated 100% of dissolved organic carbon in 4 weeks using the modified OECD screening test(8). Therefore, this compound is expected to biodegrade in the environment(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

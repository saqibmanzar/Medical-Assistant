ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Decylamine's use as bee repellent is expected to have resulted in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.1 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates decylamine will exist solely as a vapor. Vapor-phase decylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 hours. Decylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, decylamine is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 260. The pKa of decylamine is 10.6, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in cation form in the environment and cations do not volatilize from water or moist soil surfaces. Cations generally adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Decylamine should not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Decylamine was fully degraded within 9 hours when placed in a inoculum of bacteria grown on pure decylamine. When decylamine was absorbed into clay and then placed in the same inoculum about 50% degradation was observed after 24 hours. If released into water, decylamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. An estimated BCF of 6 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to decylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where decylamine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to decylamine via inhalation in the vicinity of industrial incinerators, industry, feed lots, and automotive exhaust as these emissions often contain aliphatic amines.

Volatilization of decylamine from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 6.69X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). However, a pKa of 10.6(5) indicates decylamine will exist almost entirely in the ionized form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. Decylamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.1 mm Hg(6). Decylamine was fully degraded within 9 hours when placed in a inoculum of bacteria grown on pure decylamine(7). When decylamine was absorbed into clay and placed in the same inoculum about 50% degradation was observed after 24 hours(7).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.69X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). However, a pKa of 10.6(5) indicates decylamine will exist almost entirely in the ionized form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. The pKa of decylamine indicates that this compound will primarily exist in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to suspended solids and sediment than their neutral counterparts(6). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. According to a classification scheme(7) an estimated BCF of 6(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Decylamine was fully degraded within 9 hours when placed in a inoculum of bacteria grown on pure decylamine(9). When decylamine was absorbed into clay and placed in the same inoculum about 50% degradation was observed after 24 hours(9).",

Vapor-phase decylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.3X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It sets up criteria for the classification of chemicals for physical-chemical, health, and environmental hazards of chemical substances and mixtures and sets up standardized hazard information to facilitate global trade of chemicals.  Please note that obsolete codes are added in this classification for completeness purposes, as they are still in use. Any obsolete codes are annotated as such.",

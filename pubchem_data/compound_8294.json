When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

After 20 min, maximum concentrations of 100 ng/mL linalyl acetate and 121 ng/mL linalool were reached. Within 90 min most of the lavender oil was eliminated. It was concluded that lavender oil is rapidly absorbed through the skin and is excreted within 90 minutes.",

In acidic artificial gastric juice, linalyl acetate is rapidly hydrolyzed (t1/2<5 min) to yield linalool, which rapidly rearranges into alpha-terpineol. Linalyl acetate was slowly hydrolyzed (t1/2=153-198 min) in intestinal fluid with or without pancreatin. Linalyl acetate also hydrolyzed in homogenates of rat intestinal mucosal, blood, and liver, but at rates much slower than in acidic gastric juice (rate constant for hydrolysis k=0.01-0.0055/min vs. >5/min). Based on these observations it is concluded that linalyl acetate hydrolyzes in gastric juice to yield linalool which, to some extent, is rapidly ring closed to yield alpha-terpineol.",

The lavender oil contained 24.79% linalool and 29.59% linalyl acetate. A 1500 mg sample of the lavender oil was gently massaged for 10 min into a 376 sq cm area on the abdomen of a 60 kg male volunteer. Blood samples were drawn from the left cubital vein at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 min. After adding heparin to the samples, the plasma was centrifuged and the samples were then stored until they were analyzed. Linalyl acetate was absorbed quickly and trace amounts could be detected in the blood 5 min after finishing the massage. The peak plasma concentration was reached at 19 min with a mean plasma concentration of 121 ng/mL. Most of the linalyl acetate disappeared from the blood in 90 min with a biological half-life of 14.3 min.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Thus, the/se/  ... experiments were designed to investigate the relaxation mechanism of linalyl acetate as the major ingredient of lavender essential oil in rabbit carotid artery specimens. Linalyl acetate produced sustained and progressive relaxation during the contraction caused by phenylephrine. The relaxation effect of linalyl acetate at a concentration near the EC50 was partially but significantly attenuated by nitroarginine as an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxaline-1-one as an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, or by the denudation of endothelial cells. In specimens without endothelium, the phenylephrine-induced contraction and phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) were significantly attenuated after the pretreatment with linalyl acetate. The relaxation caused by linalyl acetate in the endothelium-denuded specimens was clearly inhibited by calyculin A as an inhibitor of MLC phosphatase, although not by ML-9 as an inhibitor of MLC kinase. Furthermore, suppression of the phenylephrine-induced contraction and MLC phosphorylation with linalyl acetate was canceled by the pretreatment with calyculin A. These results suggest that linalyl acetate relaxes the vascular smooth muscle through partially activation of nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway, and partially MLC dephosphorylation via activating MLC phosphatase.",

It can also be employed in soaps and detergents and as a food additive. It is a component of oil paint. It is used in extracts and as a substitute for petitgrain oil. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Application of linalyl acetate in acetone (33%) to the back of male volunteers without known allergies during 48 hours under occlusion did not induce signs of irritation up to 120 hours after removal of the patch. Linalyl acetate is identified as one of the constituents of lavender oil that may cause allergic reactions. Oxidized linalyl acetate could be a common fragrance contact allergen. The potential genotoxicity of linalyl acetate, was evaluated in vitro by the micronucleus test on peripheral human lymphocytes. In the range of non-toxic concentrations (0.5-100 ug/mL), linalyl acetate increased the frequency of micronuclei significantly and in concentration-dependent manner. In a chromosome aberration test with human lymphocytes, linalyl acetate did not induce aberrations, both with and without S-9 mix. ANIMAL STUDIES: Inhalation exposure of mice to 2.74 mg linalyl acetate/L air during 90 minutes led to reduced motor activity compared to untreated controls. The effect was more severe in mice aged 6-8 weeks (up to 100% reduction) than in mice of 6 months (up to 81% reduction). In mice dermal coapplication of linalyl acetate (3 mg in 0.1 mL acetone) with benzo(a)pyrene did slightly increase the number of skin papillomas and carcinomas compared to benzo(a)pyrene controls. An Ames test was performed with linalyl acetate in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA102 with and without metabolic activation. Linalyl acetate was found to be not mutagenic in this assay. An in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay was negative in primary rat hepatocytes at doses up to 300 nL/mL. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: In a 96-hour flow-through test with carps (Cyprinus carpio), fish were exposed to 10, 18, 32, 56 and 100 mg/L (nominal concentrations). Mean measured concentrations were 7.9, 12.3, 20.1, 27.3 and 27.2 mg/L. At the highest concentrations (32 mg/L and above) all fish died. At all concentrations hypoactive swimming behavior, loss of equilibrium and/or immobility was observed.",

Nevertheless, the impact of fragrances on cognitive performance in humans is not well understood. The present investigation aimed to evaluate the effects of 1,8-cineol, jasmine absolute ether, linalyl acetate and peppermint essential oil on human vigilance performance. The odorants were administered by means of inhalation and, except for peppermint essential oil, were tested at 2 different dosages. Performance in a standard visual vigilance task was measured in terms of speed and accuracy and subjective ratings of the odorants were assessed in terms of pleasantness, intensity, arousal and stress. We hypothesized that 1,8-cineol, jasmine absolute ether and peppermint essential oil would improve vigilance performance, whereas linalyl acetate would impair such performance. Comparison of the performances of the seven independent experimental groups with that of a control group did not show any of the expected effects. In contrast, inhalation of linalyl acetate decreased reaction times. Within-group analyses, however, revealed significant interactions between subjective ratings of the odorants and task performance. The results of the present investigation emphasize the high impact of subjective factors on the modulation of attentional functions by olfactory stimuli in humans.",

The aim of this study was to investigate if the autoxidation observed for the single synthetic terpenes, resulting in strong contact allergens, will take place also in lavender oil. Lavender oil was exposed to air and the autoxidation was followed by chemical analysis. The sensitizing potency before and after air exposure was investigated in mice using the local lymph node assay. Patients with patch test reactions to oxidized linalool were tested to investigate if air-exposed lavender oil could elicit dermatitis in these individuals. The terpenes oxidized in air-exposed lavender oil at the same rates as the pure compounds exposed to air, and the same oxidation products were identified. The sensitizing potency of lavender oil increased accordingly on air exposure. Patch testing showed positive reactions to air-exposed lavender oil and also to oxidized linalyl acetate in patients with contact allergy to oxidized linalool. This study shows that lavender oil lacks natural protection against autoxidation, and that air-exposed lavender oil can be an important source of exposure to allergenic hydroperoxides."

Exposure to linalyl acetate occurs through cosmetic products and essential oils, but is difficult to assess, as linalyl acetate is not labelled in the EU. The objective /of this study was/ to investigate the frequencies of contact allergy to oxidized linalyl acetate among dermatitis patients, and to investigate the autoxidation of linalyl acetate in terms of hydroperoxide formation and sensitization potency. Hydroperoxide formation in air-exposed linalyl acetate was determined with high-performance liquid chromatography. The sensitization potencies of hydroperoxides were determined with the local lymph node assay. One thousand seven hundred and seventeen patients were patch tested with oxidized linalyl acetate at 6.0% in petrolatum. Of the patients, 2.2% showed positive reactions to oxidized linalyl acetate. Forty-three per cent of the positive patients also had positive patch test reactions to other fragrance markers. Linalyl acetate hydroperoxides were detected early in the autoxidation process, and accumulated to a concentration of 37% after 42 weeks of air exposure. The linalyl acetate hydroperoxides were classified as moderate sensitizers. The frequency of positive reactions to oxidized linalyl acetate is comparable to that of previously studied oxidized fragrance terpenes. Oxidized linalyl acetate could thus be a common fragrance contact allergen.",

The significant decrease in the mobility of female and male laboratory animals under standardized experimental conditions is found to be closely dependent on the exposure time to the drugs. Nevertheless after an injection of caffeine into mice a hyperactivity was observed which was reduced to nearly a normal mobility only by inhalation of these fragrance drugs. In particular the correlation of the mobility of the animals to linalool in serum is experimentally proven, thus furnishing evidence of the aromatherapeutical use of herbal pillows employed in folk medicine since ancient times in order to facilitate falling asleep or to minimize stressful situations of man.[Buchbauer G et al; Z Naturforsch",

The initial body weights of the rats ranged from 233 to 297 g. Mortality and/or systemic observations were recorded 1, 3 and 6 h post dose and subsequently once daily for 14 days. Mortality and moribundity were recorded twice daily. Gross necropsy was performed on all animals. No deaths were observed at the three lowest dose levels; 7/10 deaths were observed at 3160 mg/kg and 10/ 10 deaths were observed at 4470 mg/kg. The combined LD50 was calculated to be 2864 mg/kg (95% C.I. 2414- 3399 mg/kg; the LD50 in male rats was calculated to be 2778 mg/kg (95% C.I. 2246-3435) and the LD50 in female rats was calculated to be 2984 mg/kg (95% C.I. 2293-3884). Clinical signs observed in all dose groups included depression, ataxia, urine stains, rough coat and soft feces. Labored respiration, wheezing, hunched position, and red stains on the nose and/or eyes were observed at the two highest dose groups; prostration, tremors and lacrimination were also observed at the highest dose level. Necropsy revealed discolored lungs, thickened lobes in the liver and a thick white material adhered to and covering the liver and spleen. In addition, discolored liver, kidneys and adrenals and abnormal contents in the intestines, abdominal cavity and thoracic cavity were also observed in the animals that died during the study",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.111 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates linalyl acetate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase linalyl acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-life for these reactions in air are estimated to be 200 and 38 minutes, respectively. Linalyl acetate may also react with nitrate radicals in the atmosphere. Linalyl acetate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, linalyl acetate is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 430. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Linalyl acetate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based on its vapor pressure and that it exists as a liquid under environmental conditions. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 75% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, linalyl acetate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.8 hours and 5.8 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 180 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. The hydrolysis half-life is <24 hours at 20 \u00b0C, with expected end products of linalool and acetic acid. Occupational exposure to linalyl acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where linalyl acetate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to linalyl acetate via inhalation of product vapors, ingestion of food, and dermal contact with consumer products containing linalyl acetate.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. Be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital if advised by a physician. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

In each case, the proposals should be considered trial values during the period they are on the NIC. These proposals were ratified by the ACGIH Board of Directors and will remain on the NIC for approximately one year following this ratification. If the Committee neither finds nor receives any substantive data that changes its scientific opinion regarding an NIC TLV, the Committee may then approve its recommendation to the ACGIH Board of Directors for adoption. If the Committee finds or receives substantive data that change its scientific opinion regarding an NIC TLV, the Committee may change its recommendation to the ACGIH Board of Directors for the matter to be either retained on or withdrawn from the NIC.

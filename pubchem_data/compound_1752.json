Nonylphenol is an organic compound of the wider family of alkylphenols. It is a product of industrial synthesis formed during the alkylation process of phenols, particularly in the synthesis of polyethoxylate detergents. Because of their man-made origins, nonylphenols are classified as xenobiotics. In nonylphenols, a hydrocarbon chain of nine carbon atoms is attached to the phenol ring in either the ortho (2), meta (3), or para (4) position, with the most common ring isomers being ortho or para (e.g. figure 1 para-nonylphenol). Moreover, the alkyl chains can exist as either linear n-alkyl chains, or complex branched chains. Nonylphenol is commonly obtained as a mixture of isomers, and is thus usually found as a pale yellow liquid at room temperature with a freezing point of -10\u00c2\u00b0C and a boiling point of 295-320\u00c2\u00b0C. However, pure isomers of nonylphenol crystallize readily at room temperatures and for example, para-n-nonylphenol, forms white crystals at room temperature. Nonylphenol, and a related compound tert-octylphenol, were first detected as an air pollutant in New York City and New Jersey, probably due to its evaporation from the Hudson river and other smaller rivers in the region that routinely receive municipal wastewaters. It is possible that the atmosphere is a destructive sink for nonylphenol as it is probably reactive with atmospheric radicals and/or is photoactive.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Human placentae obtained from healthy term singleton pregnancies were utilized in a dual ex-vivo re-circulating model of placental perfusion. Six placentae were perfused for 180 min following addition of 4-NP (30 ng/mL) to the maternal perfusate. Antipyrine and FITC dextran were used as positive and negative controls respectively to validate the integrity of the circuits. 4-NP was measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with Fluorescence Detection (HPLC-FD). After 180 min of perfusion the transfer percentages for antipyrine and 4-NP were 25.6 +/- 1.4% (mean +/- s.e.m, n = 6) and 22.75 +/- 3.76% respectively and the transfer index for 4-NP was 0.8. We conclude that the intact form of 4-NP at environmentally relevant concentrations can transfer across the human placenta albeit at a slow rate.",

The influence of biotransformation, tissue distribution, and elimination on biological activity was investigated in juvenile rainbow trout following a single iv dose of [(3)H]4-nonylphenol. Distribution and elimination of [(3)H]4-nonylphenol residues in tissues sampled 1, 2, 4, 24, 48, 72, and 144 hr after dosing was determined by sample combustion and liquid scintillation counting (LSC). Total 3H-labeled residue concentrations in trout 144 hr after dosing were in order: bile >> feces >> liver > pyloric caeca > kidney > brain, gill, gonad, heart, plasma, skeletal muscle, and skin. The depletion kinetics of [(3)H]residues from tissues and plasma was biphasic with prolonged beta-phase half-lives in muscle and liver of 99 hr. Radio-HPLC analysis of metabolites in bile, liver, pyloric caeca, and feces samples demonstrated similar profiles and contrasted with muscle where only parent compound was found. The predominant metabolite in bile was a glucuronide conjugate of 4-nonylphenol. Other metabolites included glucuronide conjugates of ring or side chain hydroxylated 4-nonylphenol. Liver contained a low level (1.7%) of covalently bound residues. Metabolism studies using isolated trout hepatocytes produced a similar range of metabolites and a sulfate conjugate of hydroxylated 4-nonylphenol. Despite rapid metabolism and excretion, a substantial depot of parent compound remained in muscle which will have implications for the maintenance of 4-nonylphenol residues and associated biological activity.",

The major objective of the present study was to identify reactive metabolites of 4-NP. Following incubations of 4-NP with NADPH- and GSH-supplemented human liver microsomes, 6 GSH conjugates, along with 19 oxidized metabolites, were detected by UPLC/Q-TOF mass spectrometry utilizing the mass defect filter method. Several authentic key metabolite standards were chemically synthesized for structural identification. Three GSH conjugates were found to derive from quinone methide intermediates, and the other three resulted from ortho-benzoquinone intermediates. Conjugation of the quinone methides with GSH produced benzylic-orientated GSH conjugates by 1,6-addition, while the reaction of the ortho-benzoquinone intermediates offered aromatic-orientated GSH conjugates. The conversion of 4-NP to the quinone methides and ortho-hydroquinones required cytochromes P450, specifically CYPs1A2, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4, while the oxidation of ortho-benzohydroquinones to the corresponding benzoquinones was apparently independent of microsomal enzymes. The ortho-benzoquinone derived from 4-NP was isomerized to the corresponding hydroxyquinone methide, and the former dominated the latter at a rate of approximately 20:1. The findings of the quinone methide and benzoquinone metabolites intensified the concern on the impact of 4-NP exposure on human health.",

The method was validated and used to measure concentrations of 4-octylphenol and 4-nonylphenol congener totals in UK duplicate diet samples. Individual 4-n-octylphenol and 4-n-nonylphenol congeners were also measured, although these were not detected in any sample. Only one sample showed 4-tert-octylphenol at 8.7 ug/kg, but levels of 4-nonylphenol ranged from not detectable (<3.8 ug/kg) to 25 ug/kg. This concentration range is lower than that reported by others. Tests carried out on the stability of the octyl- and nonylphenol congeners in a duplicate diet matrix over 6 months suggest that some analyte depletion might have occurred during extended frozen storage, which in part may account for the relatively lower concentrations detected, although the extent of usage of these compounds also needs to be taken into consideration.",

Different parameters that influence microextraction and derivatization have been optimized. The quantitative linear range of analytes is 5.0-400.0 ng/L, and the correlation coefficients are more than 0.9998. Limits of detection for soft drinks and dairy products have been obtained in the range of 0.5-1.2 ng/kg and 0.01-0.04 ug/kg, respectively. Relative standard deviations of intra- and inter-day precision for retention time and peak area are in the range of 0.47-2.31 and 2.76-8.79%, respectively. Accuracy is satisfactory in the range of 81.5-118.7%. Relative standard deviations of repeatability are in the range of 0.35-1.43 and 2.36-4.75% for retention time and peak area, respectively. Enrichment factors for bisphenol A, 4-octylphenol, and 4-nonylphenol are 170.5, 240.3, and 283.2, respectively. The results of recovery and matrix effect are in the range of 82.7-114.9 and 92.0-109.0%, respectively. The proposed method has been applied to the determination of bisphenol A, 4-octylphenol, and 4-nonylphenol in soft drinks and dairy products with much higher sensitivity than many other methods.",

The PLE method showed a precision (average RSD ranged from 6 to 33%) and an accuracy (average recovery 85 and 87% for 4-NP and 4-NPE, respectively) comparable to those of Soxhlet. The extraction was performed on river sediments and no organic carbon content influence was found. The comparative study presented in this paper demonstrates that PLE is an alternative suitable extraction method for 4-nonylphenol and 4-nonylphenol ethoxylate determination in sediments.",

The application of a silica/N-(n-propyl)ethylenediamine mixed solid-phase extraction cartridge achieved relatively low matrix effects for bisphenol A, 4-octylphenol, and 4-nonylphenol in vegetable oils. Experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of derivatization, and the extraction parameters were optimized. The estimated limits of detection and quantification for bisphenol A, 4-octylphenol, and 4-nonylphenol were 0.83 and 2.5 ug/kg, respectively. In a spiked experiment in vegetable oils, the recovery of the added bisphenol A was 97.5-110.3%, recovery of the added 4-octylphenol was 64.4-87.4%, and that of 4-nonylphenol was 68.2-89.3%. This sensitive method was then applied to real vegetable oil samples from Zhejiang Province of China, and none of the target compounds were detected.",

The operating conditions such as C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microns), acetonitrile-ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and fluorescence detector with the excitation and emission wavelength at 227 nm and 313 nm respectively were used for the determination. There was good linear relationship between the concentrations of the analytes in rat serum and their peak areas in the ranges of 0.013-5.0 ug/mL for 4-NP and 0.004-3.0 ug/mL for BPA. The detection limit of the method was 13 ng/mL for 4-NP and 4 ng/mL for BPA. Recoveries of rat serum samples were 83.8%-100.0% for 4-NP and 83.3%-100.0% for BPA. The intra-day precision was 1.70%-2.70%, the inter-day precision was 2.06%-9.78%. The results showed that the method is suitable for the determination of BPA and 4-NP in serum.",

The rat tissue samples were homogenized-with methanol-ammonium acetate buffer (2:8, v/v) by a high-speed homogenizer and then BPA and 4-NP were extracted by a mixed solvent of n-hexane and diethyl ether (7:3, v/v). The organic layer was evaporated with a stream of nitrogen, and the residue was dissolved in the mobile phase. The chromatographic operating conditions were a C18 column (250 mm x 4. 6 mm i.d., 5 um), acetonitrile-ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) (75:25, v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, fluorescence detection with the excitation and emission wavelengths at 227 nm and 313 nm, respectively. Average recoveries for rat tissues at three different levels were in the range of 82.0% -95.4% for BPA and 81.2% -96.5% for 4-NP. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were 0. 37% - 5.28% and the detection limits were 4.0, 4.6, 3.2, 3.3 ng/g for BPA and 12.0, 15.6, 11.8, 13.8 ng/g for 4-NP in liver, kidney, heart and brain tissues, respectively. The intra-day precisions were 0.89% -4.50%, and the inter-day precisions were 3.10% - 12.40%. These results demonstrated that the proposed method is simple, sensitive, and reliable for the determination of BPA and 4-NP in animal tissues.",

For the first time, the electrospray ionization (ESI) parameters of probe position, voltage potential, sheath gas flow rate, auxiliary gas flow rate, and ion transfer tube temperature were thoroughly studied and optimized for each phenol by a univariate approach. As a consequence, low instrumental limits of detection were reported, demonstrating at 0.2 ng/mL (in solvent matrix) excellent injection repeatability (RSD<14.5%) and a confirmation peak for all target phenols. Extraction and purification of serum was performed by the novel Hybrid Solid Phase Extraction-Precipitation Technology technique (Hybrid SPE-PPT). The limits of detection in human blood serum were 0.80, 1.3 and 1.4 ng/mL for BPA, 4-t-OP and 4-NP, respectively.",

This study investigated 4-NP, BPA and TCS levels in urine samples of 287 children and students aged from 3 to 24 years old in Guangzhou, China. Total (free and conjugated) amounts of 4-NP, BPA and TCS in the urine samples were detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with negative chemical ionization. The detection rates of 4-NP, BPA and TCS were 100%, 100% and 93% respectively, given the detection limits of 3.8, 0.5 and 0.9 ng/L respectively. Data for 4-NP, BPA and TCS were presented in both creatinine-adjusted (microgram per gram creatinine) and unadjusted (microgram per liter) urinary concentrations. The geometric mean (GM) concentrations of urinary 4-NP, BPA and TCS were 15.92 ug/g creatinine (17.40 ug/L), 2.75 ug/g creatinine (3.00 ug/L) and 3.55 ug/g creatinine (3.77 ug/L) respectively. Multiple regression models considering age, gender, preferred drinking bottle and log-transformed creatinine were used to calculate the adjusted least square geometric mean (LSGM). Among these subjects, the females had higher LSGM concentrations of 4-NP, BPA and TCS than the males; and the only statistically significant difference was found for the LSGM concentrations of triclosan (p=0.031). Participants who reported to use ceramic cups more frequently had significantly lower LSGM concentrations of BPA than those who used plastic cups (p=0.037). Meanwhile, a three-week test of using polycarbonate bottles and ceramic cups to drink bottled water and boiled tap-water was carried out among 12 graduate students of 25 years old. The GM concentrations of urinary BPA at the end of the first week after using ceramic cups to drink bottled water were 7.16 ug/g creatinine, then decreased significantly to 3.49 ug/g creatinine after the second week of using ceramic cups to drink boiled tap-water (p<0.05), and finally increased to 4.15 ug/g creatinine after the third week of using polycarbonate bottles in drinking boiled tap-water. The results indicate that in daily life the use of polycarbonate bottles or drinking of bottled water is likely to increase the ingestion of BPA, resulting in an increase in urinary BPA levels.",

It is routinely used as a co-stabilizer with mixed-metal stabilizers for heat stabilization during plastic production. It is also used as starting material for the production of phenolic resins. HUMAN STUDIES: 4-NP is a ubiquitous environmental toxin that is formed as a byproduct in the manufacturing and/or sewage treatment of regular household items. Due to its hydrophobic nature, 4-NP can easily accumulate in living organisms, including humans, where it displays a wide range of toxic effects. 4-NP appears to increases the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease by promoting or prolonging adverse progression of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Prolonged exposure to 4-NP through the diet may lead to local damage at the level of intestinal mucosa, with potentially negative consequences for intestinal homeostasis and functionality. Exposure to 4-NP may contribute to autoimmune susceptibility and/or exacerbate existing autoimmune conditions by affecting normal expression of cytokines. ANIMAL STUDIES: Nonylphenol produced severe injury when tested externally on the eyes of rabbits. In mice 4-NP perturbed key regulators of adipogenesis and lipogenic pathway in vivo. Perinatal exposure to 4-NP increased body weight, fat mass, and serum total cholesterol and glucose levels in offspring. 4-NP may be expected to increase the incidence of obesity and can act as a potential chemical stressor for obesity and obesity-related disorders. In rats perinatal exposure to 4-NP affects the adipogenesis in both male and female F1 offspring, and this effect can be progressed to the F2 offspring through the maternal line. The genotoxicity of 4-NP was evaluated by using the D7 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results showed that 4-NP induced significant cytotoxic effect on S. cerevisiae cells at 50 mg/L, as well as mutagenic effects at the lowest tested concentrations (12 and 25 mg/L). ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: On the basis of in vitro and in vivo animal studies 4-NP is considered an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). For example, build-up of 4-NP in exposed mussels and an overall decrease of 17-beta-estradiol and testosterone levels were demonstrated. In sole (Solea solea) both plasma vitellogenin level and estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) mRNA expression were increased in tested animals following a short exposure to environmental relevant concentrations (10(-6) M) of 4-NP. In zebrafish, 4-NP is able to disrupt the notochord morphogenesis, muscle function and the neuroendocrine system during embryonic development. The analysis of plasma sex steroid levels revealed a significant increase in 17beta-estradiol and testosterone in plasma of 4-NP exposed juvenile males and females of rainbow trout, respectively. Furthermore, a significant increase was observed in plasma cortisol levels. On the other hand, 4-NP decreased both plasma triiodothyronine and thyroxine after 7 and 14 days of treatment. In Bombyx mori larvae constantly fed 4-NP at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.4 g/kg gonad development was retarded and maturity was decreased in both male and female pupae, while the sex ratio was unaffected by 4-NP exposure.",

Recently, we demonstrated that the different induction of LPA receptors by estrogens regulates cell motile activity of rat liver epithelial WB-F344 cells. In the present study, to assess whether endocrine disruptors (EDs) are involved in cellular functions through LPA signaling, we measured cell motile activity and LPA receptor expressions in WB-F344 cells treated with bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP). Using quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis, the Lpar1 expression was elevated in BPA-treated cells, whereas the Lpar3 expression was decreased. In contrast, 4-NP increased the Lpar3 expression, but not the Lpar1 and Lpar2. For cell motility assay with a Cell Culture Insert, cell motile activity of BPA-treated cells was significantly lower than that of untreated cells. In contrast, 4-NP markedly enhanced cell motile activity. The effects of BPA and 4-NP on cell motility were inhibited by the Lpar1 or Lpar3 knockdown. These results suggest that BPA and 4-NP may regulate cell motile activity through the different induction of LPA receptors in WB-F344 cells.",

Given the large number of compounds present in the environment, it is critical to identify hazardous chemical interactions rapidly. The present study utilized a prototype for a novel high-throughput assay to quantify behavioral changes over time to identify chemical interactions that affect toxicity. The independent and combined effects of 2 chemicals, diazinon (an insecticide) and 4-nonylphenol (a detergent metabolite), on the swimming behavior of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia pulex were examined. Cumulative distance and change in direction were measured repeatedly via optical tracking over 90 min. Exposure to low concentrations of diazinon (0.125-2 uM) or 4-nonylphenol (0.25-4 uM) elicited significant concentration- and time-dependent effects on swimming behavior. Exposure to 0.5 uM 4-nonylphenol alone did not significantly alter mean cumulative distance but did elicit a small, significant increase in mean angle, the measure of change in direction. When 0.5 uM 4-nonylphenol was used in combination with diazinon (0.125-0.5 uM), it augmented the adverse impact of diazinon on the swimming behavior of Daphnia. Additionally, enhanced sensitivity to diazinon was observed in animals exposed to treated wastewater effluent for 24 hr prior to a diazinon challenge. The present experiments demonstrate that exposure to 4-nonylphenol and complex chemical mixtures (e.g., treated wastewater) can enhance the toxicity of exposure to the insecticide diazinon.",

Previous work in our lab has implicated 4-NP in the progression of autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease in which macrophages mistakenly attack the intestinal linings, causing chronic inflammation. Several key pro-and anti-inflammatory molecules have been shown to be involved in the manifestation of this disease, including IL-23A, COX-2, IL-8, TLR-4, and IL-10. 4-NP's effects on these known mediators of IBD were effectively analyzed using a novel model for IBD, by which 4-NP may promote an inflammatory response. Data were collected using DNA Microarray, RT-PCR, and ELISA, after 48 hour treatment of U937 histiocytic lymphocyte cells and COLO320DM human intestinal epithelial cells with 1 nM and 5 nM concentrations of 4-NP. Significant dysregulation of the expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes was observed in U937 cells that would promote and prolong inflammation. However, TLR-4, IL-8, and COX-2 gene expressions showed unprecedented effects in COLO320DM cells suggesting that these genes mediate apoptotic processes within the gastrointestinal tract. Overall, our results suggest that 4-NP administration engenders immune responses linked to apoptotic processes via dysregulation of macrophage signaling. In sum, 4-NP appears to increases the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease by promoting or prolonging adverse progression of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.",

Due to its hydrophobic nature, 4-nonylphenol can easily accumulate in living organisms, including humans, where it displays a wide range of toxic effects. Since the gastrointestinal tract represents the main route by which 4-nonylphenol enters the body, the intestine may be one of the first organs to be damaged by chronic exposure to this pollutant through the diet. In the present study, we investigated the effects of 4-nonylphenol on a human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2 cells). We demonstrated that 4-nonylphenol was cytotoxic to cells, as revealed by a decrease of the cell number and the decrement of mitochondrial functionality after 24 hr of treatment. 4-Nonylphenol also reduced the number of cells entering into S-phase and interfered with epidermal growth factor signaling, with consequent negative effects on cell survival. In addition, 4-nonylphenol induced apoptosis, involving the activation of caspase-3, and triggered an endoplasmic reticulum-stress response, as revealed by over-expression of GRP78 (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein) and activation of XBP1 (X-box binding protein-1). Together, these findings support the hypothesis that prolonged exposure to 4-nonylphenol through the diet may lead to local damage at the level of intestinal mucosa, with potentially negative consequences for intestinal homeostasis and functionality.",

In this regard we investigated the role of 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), as a potential contributing factor in the development of immune diseases and compared it to estrogens actions since 4-NP may work via estrogen processes. The study made cytokine level expression changes in U937 cells by microarray technology coupled to RT PCR as a validating technique. It was determined that 4-NP significantly up-regulated proinflammatory cytokine expression (toll-like-receptor [TLR]-6, TLR-10, interleukin [IL]-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-17C, IL-23A, IL-8RB, IL-receptor-associated-kinase [IRAK-2], tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor [TNFR]-5, and TNFR-10). Estrogen caused insignificant increases but the changes parralelled that of 4-NP. Simultaneously, 4-NP down-regulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), while estrogen up-regulated them. 4-Nonylphenol may initiate its toxic effects and pose a risk to autoimmunity-prone individuals by eliciting effects up to 4 times more potent than estrogen. Overall, exposure to 4-NP may contribute to autoimmune susceptibility and/or exacerbate existing autoimmune conditions by dys-regulating normal expression of cytokines.",

Implication of environmental endocrine disruptor such as 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) on adipose tissue development has been poorly investigated. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were incubated with different doses of 4-NP. Six-week-old C57BL/6J male mice received an intraperitoneal injection of vehicle, troglitazone or 4-NP (0.5 mg/kg). Gene expression of adipogenic regulators was analyzed. Pregnant mice were dosed by gavage with vehicle or 4-NP (0.05, 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg) from day 12 of gestation until day 7 of lactation. The body weight, liver weight, fat mass, and serum lipids and glucose levels were measured in offspring at postnatal day 60. Low concentration of 4-NP induced adipocyte differentiation, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma as well as its target genes required for adipogenesis. 4-NP perturbed key regulators of adipogenesis and lipogenic pathway in vivo. Perinatal exposure to 4-NP increased body weight, fat mass, and serum total cholesterol and glucose levels in offspring.  4-NP may be expected to increase the incidence of obesity and can act as a potential chemical stressor for obesity and obesity-related disorders.",

Pregnant Wistar rats received either vehicle or 4-NP (5, 25 and 125 ug/kg/day) from gestation to postnatal day 21. F1 pups were subjected to blood biochemistry tests, or killed to obtain their gonadal fat to determine gene expression. Some F1 adult female rats were mated with F1 males from control group to obtain F2 pups, but without any exposure to 4-NP in the perinatal stage. F2 pups underwent studies similar to those performed on F1 pups. Serum total cholesterol, leptin levels were significantly elevated, the quantity and size of fat cells were increased, gene expression of key regulators of adipogenesis and lipogenic pathway of fat tissue were perturbed by 4-NP (p<0.05 or p<0.01). In addition, the expression of mRNA levels and protein of ERalpha were downregulated in adipose tissue in the two generation offspring. Perinatal exposure to 4-NP affects the adipogenesis in both male and female F1 offspring, and this effect can be progressed to the F2 offspring through the maternal line.",

Nonylphenol is one of the most abundant alkylphenol ethoxylate derivatives, being detected in food products. Diverse studies have classified nonylphenol as hazardous to the health, especially to male reproduction. This in vitro study aimed to examine the effects of 4-nonylphenol on androstenedione and testosterone production as well as on the viability of Leydig cells of NMRI mice. The cells were cultured for 44 h with addition of 0.04; 0.2; 1.0; 2.5 and 5.0 ug/mL of 4-nonylphenol and compared to the control. Quantification of testosterone and androstenedione directly from aliquots of the medium was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell viability was measured by the metabolic activity assay for mitochondrial functional activity. Androstenedione production significantly (P < 0.001) increased with 1.0; 2.5 and 5.0 ug/mL 4-nonylphenol. Although cAMP-stimulated testosterone production was not significantly affected by 4-nonylphenol, a tendency to attenuate the level of testosterone in the Leydig cells treated with 2.5 and 5.0 ug/mL 4-nonylphenol was observed. The viability of mouse Leydig cells was slightly increased at the lowest doses of 4-nonylphenol (0.04 and 0.2 ug/mL). We also observed an increase at higher concentrations of the substance (1.0; 2.5 and 5.0 ug/mL), but this increase was not significant. Further investigations are required to establish the biological significance and possible reproductive implications.",

The study examined reproductive, immunological, and growth endpoints in tree swallows exposed to chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants and to 4-nonylphenol in wastewater lagoons at the Iona Wastewater Treatment Plant, Vancouver (BC, Canada). Clutch size was significantly lower in tree swallows breeding at Iona Island in 2000 and 2001 compared to the reference site. In 2000, fledging success was significantly lower and mean mass of nestling livers was significantly higher in the tree swallows breeding at the Iona Island Wastewater Treatment Plant. Additional factors that may influence reproductive success, such as parental provisioning and diet composition, did not differ significantly between sites. Levels of 4-nonylphenol detected in sediment and insects were elevated at the Iona Island Wastewater Treatment Plant (2000: lagoon sediment 82,000 ng/g dry weight, insects 310 ng/g wet weight; 2001: lagoon sediment 383,900 ng/g dry weight, insects 156 ng/g wet weight) compared to the reference site (2000: pond sediment 1,100 ng/g dry weight, insects not sampled; 2001: pond sediment 642 ng/g dry weight, insects 98 ng/g wet weight). These results indicate that tree swallows might be a useful indicator species for exposure to 4-nonylphenol at wastewater treatment sites; however, further work is necessary to determine the extent of uptake and effects of 4-nonylphenol in riparian insectivorous birds.",

To determine the effect of 4-nonylphenol on semen quality rainbow trout were exposed to three concentrations of 4-nonylphenol in a flow-through system during the spawning period (60 days). At an estimated 4-nonylphenol concentration of 750 ng/L semen production was completely inhibited, at 280 and 130 ng/L the semen production was significantly reduced in comparison to the control. Sperm density, sperm motility and sperm fertility were not affected. Also the development of embryos and larvae at the end of yolk sac stage was affected by 4-nonylphenol. At estimated 4-nonylphenol exposure levels of 280 and 750 ng/L the percentage of eyed stage embryos was slightly but significantly lower (2-4%) than at 130 ng/L 4-nonylphenol and in the control. At 4-nonylphenol concentrations of 750 ng/L only 23.8 +/- 1.2% of the larvae survived to the end of the yolk sac stage, at 280 ng/L 53.7 +/- 8.2%, at 130 ng/L 73.8 +/- 1.5%, and in the control 70.9 +/- 1.8%. Sperm motility was not affected by 4-nonylphenol as sperm motility rate, swimming velocity, swimming pattern and motility duration were similar in water and in water containing of 100, 250, or 750 ng/L 4-nonylphenol. Incubation of eggs in physiological saline solution containing of 100, 250, or 750 ng/L 4-nonylphenol did not change their fertilizability in comparison to the control. Therefore, 4-nonylphenol did not affect the egg viability. Also the fertilization process (sperm egg contact) was not influenced by 4-nonylphenol as the fertilization rate (percentage of hatched larvae) was similar to the control when eggs were fertilized in water containing of 100, 250, or 750 ng/L 4-nonylphenol.",

On the basis of in vitro and in vivo animal studies 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) is considered an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). The evidence to date indicates that mollusks are able to synthesize sex steroids from the precursor cholesterol and their endocrine pathways are theoretically susceptible to disruption. The aim of this study was to investigate the endocrine modulating potency of 4-NP in the freshwater mussel Dreissena polymorpha by looking at endogenous steroid levels in control and exposed individuals. 4-NP bioaccumulation in mussels tissues and alterations in the activity of enzymes related both to oxidative stress (catalase - CAT- and glutathione peroxidase - GPX-) and phase II metabolism (glutathione-S-transferase - GST-) were also assessed. The results highlighted a build-up of 4-NP in exposed mussels and an overall decrease of 17-beta-estradiol and testosterone levels. On the other hand this chemical at the tested concentrations does not interfere with the antioxidant defense mechanisms in D. polymorpha. The mechanisms by which 4-NP alter steroids levels are unknown and require more in-depth investigations.",

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possibility that the alkylphenol degradation product 4-nonylphenol is embryotoxic to the crustacean Daphnia magna through its known ability to interfere with the metabolic elimination of testosterone. Direct exposure of maternal daphnids to testosterone caused developmental abnormalities in neonates that consisted of partial arrest of early embryonic development and abnormalities in shell spine and first antennae development. Exposure of maternal daphnids to concentrations of 4-nonylphenol also produced developmental abnormalities though the profile of abnormalities was distinct from that observed throughout the testosterone concentration-response curve. Thus, 4-nonylphenol is a developmental toxicant in daphnids, but its toxicity is not consistent with that elicited by elevated testosterone accumulation. Further experiments demonstrated that testosterone was directly toxic to developing embryos, and the maternal organism can serve as the vector for this toxicity. In contrast, neither direct embryo exposure nor early maternal exposure to 4-nonylphenol elicited embryotoxicity consistent with that observed during continuous maternal and gestational exposure. Thus, 4-nonylphenol is not directly embryotoxic at these exposure levels, but rather toxicity is mediated by maternal influences during gestation. The threshold concentration for the occurrence of developmental abnormalities (approximately 44 ug/L) indicates that typical environmental concentrations of 4-nonylphenol pose no imminent hazard with respect to developmental toxicity. However, these effects do occur at sufficiently low levels to warrant evaluation of the relative susceptibility of other crustacean species to this previously uncharacterized mode of toxicity.",

A major source of 4-nonylphenol in the environment is the degradation of these alkylphenol ethoxylates. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 8.18X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-nonylphenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-nonylphenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.5 hours. 4-Nonylphenol does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 4-nonylphenol is expected to have no mobility based upon Koc values of 6900-53,300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 4-Nonylphenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 4-Nonylphenol is expected to biodegrade rapidly in soil based on degradation of >90% in 20 days; however, the field dissipation half-life of 4-nonylphenol in soils treated with centrifuge dried biosolids and lagoon dried biosolids was 257 and 248 days, respectively. If released into water, 4-nonylphenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the reported Koc values. Based on the biodegradation of 4-nonylphenol in seawater of about 50% after 58 days, 4-nonylphenol is expected to biodegrade in the aqueous environment. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.8 and 17 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1.3-9.6 years if adsorption is considered. BCFs of 15-1300 measured in a variety of fish suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high depending on the species. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 4-nonylphenol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-nonylphenol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 4-nonylphenol mainly via ingestion of fish or seafood that have accumulated 4-nonylphenol. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(5) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 8.18X10-4 mm Hg(6), and water solubility, 7 mg/L(7). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(5), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.8 and 17 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1.3-9.6 years if adsorption is considered(8). According to a classification scheme(9), BCFs of 15-1300 measured in a variety of fish(10-12), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high depending on the species. Based on the biodegradation of 4-nonylphenol in seawater of about 50% after 58 days, 4-nonylphenol is expected to biodegrade in the aqueous environment(13).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 4-nonylphenol is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 1.8 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 17 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1.3-9.6 years if adsorption is considered(4). 4-Nonylphenol's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 4-Nonylphenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

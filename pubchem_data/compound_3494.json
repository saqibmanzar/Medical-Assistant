They are both quaternary ammonium compounds and long acting muscarinic antagonists. It is one of the most commonly prescribed anticholinergic medications. Early research into glycopyrronium use was for its indication as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcers. Later research, taking advantage of the systemic distribution of muscarinic receptors through the body, found that glycopyrronium could also be used for reducing sweat gland, oral, airway, and gastric secretions; as well as reducing cardiac inhibitory reflexes; and reducing bronchoconstriction in COPD. Glycopyrronium is commonly prescribed as a first line treatment for a wide variety indications and is considered to have a wider therapeutic window than [tiotropium].  Glycopyrronium was originally granted FDA approval on 11 August 1961.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Muscarinic receptors M1 to M4 are found in the lung, although M3 is predominantly responsible for bronchoconstriction and airway secretions. Secretions from salivary and sweat glands, as well as gastric acid secretions, are also predominantly mediated by the M3 receptor. Salivary and gastric acid secretions are also partially mediated by the M1 receptor. Antagonism of these receptors decreases the volume of their respective secretions, and in the case of the gastrointestinal system, reduces the acidity of the stomach.  In the cardiovascular system, muscarinic receptors M1 to M5 are all present, however the function of M5 has not been described in literature. Under normal circumstances, stimulation of the vagal nerve lowers the heart rate, potentially leading to intraoperative bradycardia. Studies in mice suggest that this stimulation is predominantly mediated by the M3 receptor, and mutant knockout mice are not susceptible to these effects.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

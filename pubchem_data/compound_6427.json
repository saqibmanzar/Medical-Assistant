PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /CFCs and HCFCs/",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The original Montreal Protocol was agreed on 16 September 1987 and entered into force on 1 January 1989. The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(v) and 2.125(e)(4)(iv) is effective December 31, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(iii) is effective June 30, 2011. Removal of 2.125(e)(2)(iv) and Part 2.125(e)(4)(viii) is effective December 31, 2013. /Ozone-Depleting Substances/",

As impressive as these accomplishments are, our work is not done. Even though we have reduced or eliminated the use of many ozone-depleting substances, some still remain. Additionally, since ozone-depleting substances persist in the air for long periods of time, the past use of these substances continues to affect the ozone layer today. We must also continue to ensure that the alternatives being brought to the market support the country's long-term environmental goals in a cost-effective manner.[EPA; Achievements in Stratospheric Ozone Protection Progress Report, Available from, as of March 11, 2013: http://www.epa.gov/ozone/downloads/spd-annual-report_final.pdf]",

Patients must be removed from the exposure environment, & high flow supplemental oxygen should be utilized. The respiratory system should be evaluated for injury, aspiration, or pulmonary edema & treated appropriately. CNS findings should be treated supportively. A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin & countershock may be effective. Cryogenic dermal injuries should be treated by water bath rewarming at 40-42 \u00b0C until vasodilatory flush has returned. Elevation of the limb & standard frostbite management with late surgical debridement should be utilized. Ocular exposure requires irrigation & slit lamp evaluation for injury. /Freons/",

A review of the results of studies with these halogenated ethanes has revealed several consistencies between the pattern of halogen substitution and neoplastic responses in some affected organs. One of these consistencies was the finding of a modest increase in the incidence of renal tubule cell neoplasms in male rats administered penta- or hexachloroethane. Certain aspects of the nephropathy also noted in these studies resembled what is now recognized as a distinct hyaline droplet nephropathy typically associated with the accumulation of alpha2u-globulin in renal tubule cells. In an attempt to determine some of the structure activity relationships involved in the induction of hyaline droplet nephropathy by halogenated ethanes, a series of commercially available ethanes substituted with three or more chlorines, four or more bromines, or a combination of chlorines and fluorines was studied in a short-term renal toxicity assessment in male F344/N rats. ... Groups of five male rats were administered the vehicle (corn oil) or 0.62 or 1.24 mmol/kg 1,1,2,2-TC-1,2-DFE ... by gavage in a corn oil vehicle (5 mL/kg body weight) 7 days a week for 3 weeks. Additionally, five male and five female rats received the corn oil vehicle only, and five females designated as negative controls were administered 1.24 mmol/kg PCE. ... Necropsies were performed on all rats that survived to the end of the study and on four rats administered 0.62 mmol/kg 1,1,2,2-TBE that died early. The right kidney, liver, and right testis were weighed. ... All male rats administered 1,1,2,2-TC-1,2-DFE survived until the end of the study. The final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of dosed males were similar to those of the controls . There were no clinical signs of toxicity. There were no significant differences in organ weights between dosed and control males. Males in the 0.62 and 1.24 mmol/kg groups had a greater urine AST activity than the controls, and the 1.24 mmol/kg group also had slightly higher NAG activity than the controls. No microscopic effects attributable to 1,1,2,2-TC-1,2-DFE administration were present in either the kidney or the liver at either dose level. PCNA staining was not performed due to the absence of a detectable treatment effect in routine sections. The chlorofluorocarbon ... 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane ... did not induce hyaline droplet nephropathy, and rats administered these compounds had no appreciable signs of toxicity except for a modest increase in urinary AST and NAG activities with 1,1,2,2,tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane. Renal toxicity of some fluorinated chemicals such as methoxyflurane has been reported and attributed, at least in part, to fluoride ions released during metabolism, although studies of other ethane-based chlorofluorocarbons generally do not indicate the kidney as a target of toxicity.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 50.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane is extremely stable in the troposphere where it does not react with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone molecules, or nitrate radicals. Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine. These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer. If released to soil, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-1 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Structurally similar compounds have been shown to biodegrade under anaerobic conditions, but are generally slow to degrade under aerobic conditions. If released into water, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.5 hours and 5.6 days, respectively. BCF values of 36 to 106 measured in carp suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. Chemical hydrolysis of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane is not an important environmental fate process. Occupational exposure to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane is produced or used. However, since this compound is no longer produced in the US, very little occupational exposure among US workers is expected. The ban on production and import of Class I ODS (Ozone-Depleting Substances) took effect on January 1, 1996. Due to its long atmospheric residence time, the general population is exposed to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane through inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine. These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer(3-5). By analogy to other Freon compounds, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane is predicted to have a stratospheric lifetime on the order of several decades(6). Chemical hydrolysis of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane is not an important environmental fate process(6). 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(7). 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane does not contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Occupational exposure to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane is produced or used. However, since this compound is no longer produced in the US, very little occupational exposure among US workers is expected. The ban on production and import of halons took effect on January 1, 1994. The ban on production and import of other Class I ODS (Ozone-Depleting Substances) - excluding methyl bromide - took effect on January 1, 1996(2). Due to its long atmospheric residence time, the general population is exposed to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane through inhalation of ambient air(SRC).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

In a semi-static 21-day reproduction test the lowest concentrations at which the population growth rate and mean length of the animals significantly (p<0.01) decreased were 1.8 mg/L and 3.2 mg/L respectively. For fish (Leuciscus idus), the value of acute toxicity (96-hr LC50) in an open system under semi-static conditions is 6.3 mg/L and the corresponding value (48-hr LC50) in a closed system under static conditions is 4.5 mg/L. The lowest 96-hr LC0 was 3.15 mg/L. In the prolonged fish toxicity test under semi-static conditions a 14 day LC50 value of 4.9 mg/L has been found for Poecilia reticulata.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.00383 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,4-dichloro-2-nitrobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,4-dichloro-2-nitrobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 320 days. 1,4-Dichloro-2-nitrobenzene absorbs UV light above 290 nm and therefore is photodegraded in sunlight. If released to soil, 1,4-dichloro-2-nitrobenzene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 590. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Photodegradation is expected to occur on surfaces exposed to sunlight. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 4% of the theoretical BOD was reached in four weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, 1,4-dichloro-2-nitrobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.4 and 36 days, respectively. An observed BCF range of 18-118 in carp and rainbow trout suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Photodegradation in water is expected to occur; an estimated direct photolysis half-life of 34 days can be made for a model body of water 500 cm deep. Abiotic hydrolysis does not occur in the environment. Occupational exposure to 1,4-dichloro-2-nitrobenzene may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,4-dichloro-2-nitrobenzene is produced or used. 1,4-Dichloro-2-nitrobenzene is not contained in consumer products; therefore, exposure to the general population will not occur via contact with consumer products.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-5 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.4 and 36 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), observed BCF values of 18-118, measured in carp and rainbow trout(6,7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate(SRC). 1,4-Dichloro-2-nitrobenzene has an epilson of 0.00126 at 300 nm in aqueous solution(8) which indicates the compound may be susceptible to direct photolysis(SRC); an approximated quantum yield of 0.01 can be used to estimate a half-life of 34 days in a model sunlit body of water with a 500 cm depth(2). In an aqueous hydrolysis test (OECD Test guideline 111), benzene, 1,4-dichloro-2-nitro was stable to abiotic hydroylsis at pHs 4, 7 and 9 at 25 \u00b0C(8). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 4% of the theoretical BOD was reached in four weeks(6) indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

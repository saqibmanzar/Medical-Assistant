Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by having different receptors, target cells, and effects. Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Paramethasone reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression.",

The total concentrations of each hormone, as well as the paramethasone acetate-induced suppressibility (measured as percent decrease in the mean 24 hr plasma level) were analyzed. paramethasone acetate suppressed neither the basal nor circadian rhythm of testosterone and had no effect on LH, FSH or prolactin output. Dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, estradiol were significantly reduced and the basal concentrations and circadian variations of cortisol were abolished. Paramethasone acetate showed a dual control on the pituitary gonadal axis and while causing a maximal suppressed adrenocortical activity it had no interference in testosterone synthesis. /Paramethasone acetate/",

They interact with specific intracellular receptor proteins in target tissues to alter the expression of corticosteroid-responsive genes. Glucocorticoid-specific receptors in the cell cytoplasm bind with steroid ligands to form hormone-receptor complexes that eventually translocate to the cell nucleus. There these complexes bind to specific DNA sequences and alter their expression. The complexes may induce the transcription of mRNA leading to synthesis of new proteins. Such proteins include lipocortin, a protein known to inhibit PLA2a and thereby block the synthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and PAF. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the production of other mediators including AA metabolites such as COX, cytokines, the interleukins, adhesion molecules, and enzymes such as collagenase. /Glucocorticoids/"

For phase I, PA + mestranol, 6 mg + 80 micrograms per day for 10 days, was administered. Ten days were allowed for withdrawal of medication. For phase II, mestranol, 80 micrograms per day for 10 days, free of the glucocorticoid was administered. Daily samples of cervical mucus, vaginal cells, and peripheral blood were obtained to analyze fernlike crystallization (%), cornified pyknotic nuclei cells (%), and concentrations of ethynyl-estradiol (EE-2, pg/ml) during both phases. The fernlike crystallization pattern had a mean value of 8 +/- 0.9% for phase I, while for phase II it was 85 +/- 8% (P less than 0.05). The percentage mean value of cornified pyknotic nuclei cells of phase I was 28 +/- 5% in comparison with 53 +/- 7% observed in phase II (P less than 0.05). EE-2 mean value concentrations for phase I were 85 +/- 90 pg/ml, while for phase II they were 724 +/- 418 pg/ml (P less than 0.05). These results demonstrate that 6 mg of PA is able to compete against the estrogenic action in the parameters of the study selected.",

Patients whose susceptibility to infection is high, such as those receiving glucocorticoids as immunosuppressive therapy, are especially likely to develop secondary infections. Patients receiving glucocorticoids who are potentially immunosuppressed should be warned of the risk of exposure to certain infections (e.g., chickenpox, measles) and of the importance of obtaining medical advice if such exposure occurs. Since glucocorticoid therapy can reactivate tuberculosis, treatment of latent tuberculosis infection should be included in the regimen of patients with a history of active tuberculosis undergoing prolonged glucocorticoid therapy. If glucocorticoids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary. Use of glucocorticoids in patients with active tuberculosis should be restricted to those with fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which glucocorticoids are used in conjunction with appropriate antimycobacterial chemotherapy.

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

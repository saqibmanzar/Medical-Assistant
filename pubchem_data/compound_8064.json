Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The favorable sedative effect of 4-hydroxybutyric acid-sodium in the treatment of intensive-care patients had the disadvantage that the patients were given too much sodium (1g sodium hydroxybutyrate is equivalent to 180 mg sodium). Attempts were therefore made to use the parent compound, 1,4-butanediol , directly. A single iv injection of ...1,4-butanediol... /was/ given to each of 3 artificially ventilated patients (19 to 43 years of age) caused 2 of the patients to fall asleep for 60 minutes and 3 hours, respectively. In 1 of these patients, no pain occurred for 45 to 60 minutes after the injection. The patients fell asleep 5 to 10 minutes after the injection. For 2.5 to 3 hours after administration, the tendon reflexes were absent. Cardiovascular and hematological parameters, liver and kidney function, body temperature and swallowing reflex were unaffected. The plasma 4-hydroxybutyric acid level was 150 to 180 ug/mL in all 3 patients 20 to 30 minutes after the injection. Iv injection of /a lesser dose/ caused only a slight reduction in spontaneous movement, in particular, eye movements (1 patient studied). Three further patients (23 to 40 years), 1 patient with cerebral contusion, the other two patients with no neurological abnormalities), were given an initial dose ...iv followed by an iv infusion ...for 38 or 68 hours... . The infusions had to be briefly interrupted due to medical or technical problems, and/or additional bolus injections were given. 1,4-Butanediol caused sleep as well as loss of swallowing and tendon reflexes during the entire infusion period. In 2 of the patients, restlessness occurred during infusion, and in 1, periodic contractions of the muscles of the extremities. Changes in liver and kidney function and in hematological parameters were not seen in the patients either during or at the end of infusion, nor were any treatment-related neurological effects observed.",

Using in vivo microdialysis we measured the appearance of GHB in the striata of rats after peripheral 1,4-BD administration. We developed and utilized an HPLC-UV (215 nm) detection of GHB that yielded a limit of quantification (S/N=10) of 2.0 micro g/mL (40 ng/injection) and a limit of detection (S/N=3) of 0.75 micro g/mL (15 ng/injection). GHB appeared in the striatal microdialysates within 20 min after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of varying doses of 1,4-BD. GHB concentrations reached dose-dependent maxima 80-100 min post-1,4-BD administration, with peak values of 10.6+/-2.9, 25.3+/-3.4 and 48.1+/-7.1 micro g/mL (mean+/-S.E.M.), corresponding to 1,4-BD doses of 250, 500 and 750 mg/kg, respectively. The conversion of 1,4-BD to GHB was completely prevented by the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole (4MP), administered prior to 1,4-BD, as evidenced by the failure of GHB to appear in the striatal microdialysates. Sleep times in animals were similarly correlated with GHB concentrations in the microdialysates.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the degradation of 1,4-BD in cytosolic supernatant of human liver in vitro, and to verify involvement of the suggested enzymes by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The coingestion of 1,4-BD and ethanol (EtOH) might cause complex pharmacokinetic interactions in humans. Therefore, the effect of EtOH on 1,4-BD metabolism by human liver was examined in vitro. Additionally, the influence of acetaldehyde (AL), which might inhibit the second step of 1,4-BD degradation, was investigated. In case of a 1,4-BD intoxication, the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole, FOM) has been discussed as an antidote preventing the formation of the central nervous system depressing GHB. Besides FOM, we tested pyrazole, disulfiram, and cimetidine as possible inhibitors of the formation of GHB from 1,4-BD catalyzed by human liver enzymes in vitro. The conversion of 1,4-BD to GHB was inhibited competitively by EtOH with an apparent K(i) of 0.56 mM. Therefore, the coingestion of 1,4-BD and EtOH might increase the concentrations and the effects of 1,4-BD itself. By contrast AL accelerated the formation of GHB. All antidotes showed the ability to inhibit the formation of GHB. In comparison FOM showed the highest inhibitory effectiveness. Furthermore, the results confirm strong involvement of ADH in 1,4-BD metabolism by human liver.",

An aqueous solution of 2-butyne-1,4-diol (30 - 50%), together with carbon monoxide-free hydrogen and recycled reaction mixture, which acts as medium for dissipation of heat, is lead over a reduced nickel - copper - manganese catalysts on silica gel strands. The initial temperature in the reactor is 80 \u00b0C; the temperature must not exceed 170 \u00b0C. In order to obtain a better distribution of the liquid, hydrogen is also circulated. The raw product contains methanol, propanol, and butanol as byproducts as well as traces of 2-methyl-1,4-butanediol, hydroxybutyraldehyde, acetals, and triols. The reactor effluent is worked up to pure 1,4-butanediol by fractional distillation.",

In recent years, gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) has emerged as a significant drug of abuse throughout the United States. Abusers of this drug fall into three major groups: (1) users take GHB for its intoxicant or euphoriant effects; (2) bodybuilders who abuse GHB for its alleged utility as an anabolic agent or as a sleep aid; and (3) individuals who use GHB as a weapon for sexual assault. These categories are not mutually exclusive and an abuser may use the drug illicitly to produce several effects. GHB is frequently taken with alcohol or other drugs that heighten its effects and is often found at bars, nightclubs, rave parties, and gyms.",

Reports suggested that the beads contained 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD), a precursor to gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), rather than the intended, but more expensive 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PD). We measured the 1,4-BD and 1,5-PD content of Aqua Dots beads to determine if 1,5-PD had been completely substituted with 1,4-BD by the manufacturer, and if the reported clinical effects from swallowing Aqua Dots beads were consistent with the estimated ingested 1,4-BD dose. In vitro bench research using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) was performed. Dilute samples of pure 1,4-BD and 1,5-PD in water were used for the calibration of the GC-MS instrument. We then soaked Aqua Dots beads in water for varying durations, and the resultant solutions were analyzed for 1,4-BD and 1,5-PD content. Aqua Dots beads weighed 79.3 mg each (+/- 0.6 mg, SD), and contained 13.7% (+/- 2.4%, SD) 1,4-BD by weight; this corresponds to a 1,4-BD content of 10.8 mg (+/- 1.9 mg, SD) per bead. No 1,5-PD was detected in any beads. Aqua Dots beads contained a surprisingly high amount (nearly 14%) of extractable 1,4-BD. No 1,5-PD was detected, corroborating reports that this chemical had been completely replaced with a substitute that is metabolized into GHB after ingestion. Reports of ataxia, vomiting, seizure activity, and self-limited coma in children are consistent with the ingestion of several dozen Aqua Dots beads.",

Although the use of DBS has many advantages, it is also associated with some challenges. E.g. given the limited amount of available material, highly sensitive detection techniques are often required to attain sufficient sensitivity. In gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), derivatization can be helpful to achieve adequate sensitivity. Because this additional sample preparation step is considered as time-consuming, we introduce a new derivatization procedure, i.e. \"microwave-assisted on-spot derivatization\", to minimize sample preparation of DBS. In this approach the derivatization reagents are directly applied onto the DBS and derivatization takes place in a microwave instead of via conventional heating. In this manuscript we evaluated the applicability of this new concept of derivatization for the determination of two polar low molecular weight molecules, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and gabapentin, in DBS using a standard GC-MS configuration. The method was successfully validated for both compounds, with imprecision and bias values within acceptance criteria (<20% at LLOQ, <15% at 3 other QC levels). Calibration lines were linear over the 10-100 ug/mL and 1-30 ug/mL range for GHB and gabapentin, respectively. Stability studies revealed no significant decrease of gabapentin and GHB in DBS upon storage at room temperature for at least 84 days. Furthermore, DBS-specific parameters, including hematocrit and volume spotted, were evaluated. As demonstrated by the analysis of GHB and gabapentin positive samples, \"microwave-assisted on-spot derivatization\" proved to be reliable, fast and applicable in routine toxicology. Moreover, other polar low molecular weight compounds of interest in clinical and/or forensic toxicology, including vigabatrin, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol and 1,2-butanediol, can also be detected using this method.",

The blood proteins were precipitated using a mixture of methanol and acetonitrile, and the extract was cleaned-up by passage through a polymeric strong cation exchange sorbent. Separation of the analytes and their structural isomers was obtained using a column with a zwitterionic stationary phase. Matrix-matched calibrants, combined with isotope dilution, were used for quantitative analysis. GHB was determined in both positive and negative ion modes. The relative intra-laboratory reproducibility standard deviations were better than 10% and 6% for blood samples at concentrations of 2 mg/L and 20-150 mg/L, respectively. The mean true extraction recoveries were 80% for GHB and greater than 90% for GBL and 1,4-BD at concentration levels of 20-50 mg/L. The limits of detection were approximately 0.5 mg/L for GHB and GBL, and 0.02 mg/L for 1,4-BD in ante-mortem blood. The corresponding lower limits of quantification were less than 1 mg/L for GHB and GBL, and less than 0.1 mg/L for 1,4-BD. GBL was unstable in whole blood freshly preserved with a sodium fluoride oxalate mixture, but the stability could be improved significantly by preservation with a sodium fluoride citrate EDTA mixture.",

Usual validation parameters were tested: linearity, repeatability and intermediate precision, limits of detection and quantification, carry over and ion suppression. Limits of detection were between 0.18 and 1.1 mg/L, and limits of quantification were between 0.4 and 2.3 mg/L. Separation of isomers was possible either chromatographically or by selecting specific multiple reaction monitoring transitions. This method could be a useful tool in case of suspected intoxication with antifreeze agents, solvents, dietary supplements or some medical drug compounds.",

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry /was used/ to measure 1,4-butanediol or its metabolite, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, in urine, serum, or blood. Nine episodes of toxic effects in eight patients who had ingested 1,4-butanediol recreationally, to enhance bodybuilding, or to treat depression or insomnia /were identified/. One patient presented twice with toxic effects and had withdrawal symptoms after her second presentation. Clinical findings and adverse events included vomiting, urinary and fecal incontinence, agitation, combativeness, a labile level of consciousness, respiratory depression, and death. No additional intoxicants were identified in six patients, including the two who died. The doses of 1,4-butanediol ingested ranged from 5.4 to 20 g in the patients who died and ranged from 1 to 14 g in the nonfatal cases. The health risks of 1,4-butanediol are similar to those of its counterparts, gamma-hydroxybutyrate and gamma-butyrolactone.

It is used as an industrial solvent, intermediate in organic synthesis, and polymer feedstock. Two studies have been identified concerning the experimental use of 1,4-butanediol as a sedative. HUMAN STUDIES: It was reported that sleep is induced by intravenous administration or by infusion. Undesirable side-effects which may occur include restlessness and clonic spasms of the muscle of the extremities. Cases of abuse and fatal intoxication have been reported. ANIMAL STUDIES: Gauze patches with undiluted 1,4-butanediol were applied to the intact and abraded skin of rabbits with occlusive dressing for 24 hours. After 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours, no reaction was observed on the intact and abraded skin. The main signs of toxicity seen in mice and rats were accelerated breathing, dyspnea, spasmodic breathing, bradycardia, exsiccosis, exophthalmus, apathy, hyperreflexia, hyporeflexia, areflexia, ataxia, atonia, twitching, reduced motility, analgesia, lying on the side, loss of righting reflexes, sedation, narcosis, hair loss and ruffled fur. Death occurred within 24 hours. Respiratory failure was thought to be the cause of death. Signs of intoxication appeared more quickly after rectal than after oral administration. In rat developmental studies, administration was conducted by gavage at doses of 200, 400 or 800 mg/kg/day from 14 days before mating to 14 days after mating in males and from 14 days before mating to day 3 of lactation in females. The parental animals exhibited no alteration in reproductive parameters including the copulation index, fertility index, gestation length, numbers of corpora lutea or implantation, implantation index, gestation index, delivery index, and behavior at delivery and lactation. Although neither the pup viability nor the incidence of morphological abnormalities was changed by administration of the compound, pup body weight was slightly but significantly decreased in the 800 mg/kg group. In a gene mutation assay using CHO cells, 1,4-butanediol did not induce any reproducible statistically or biologically significant increase in the mutant frequency of the HPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase) locus with and without metabolic activation. A gene reverse mutation test was negative in S. typhimurium TA 100, TA 98, TA 1535, TA 1537 and E.coli WP2 uvrA with and without metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Toxicity of this chemical to aquatic organisms seems to be low, because all toxicity data obtained were higher than 85 mg/L or 1000 mg/L which were the maximum concentrations of exposure. No fish died, and no toxic symptoms were observed in fish exposed to 92.5 mg/L of this chemical throughout 14 day test period. Also, any reproduction impairment was not observed in D. magna exposed to 85 mg/L.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the degradation of 1,4-BD in cytosolic supernatant of human liver in vitro, and to verify involvement of the suggested enzymes by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The coingestion of 1,4-BD and ethanol (EtOH) might cause complex pharmacokinetic interactions in humans. Therefore, the effect of EtOH on 1,4-BD metabolism by human liver was examined in vitro. Additionally, the influence of acetaldehyde (AL), which might inhibit the second step of 1,4-BD degradation, was investigated. In case of a 1,4-BD intoxication, the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole, FOM) has been discussed as an antidote preventing the formation of the central nervous system depressing GHB. Besides FOM, we tested pyrazole, disulfiram, and cimetidine as possible inhibitors of the formation of GHB from 1,4-BD catalyzed by human liver enzymes in vitro. The conversion of 1,4-BD to GHB was inhibited competitively by EtOH with an apparent K(i) of 0.56 mM. Therefore, the coingestion of 1,4-BD and EtOH might increase the concentrations and the effects of 1,4-BD itself. By contrast AL accelerated the formation of GHB. All antidotes showed the ability to inhibit the formation of GHB. In comparison FOM showed the highest inhibitory effectiveness. Furthermore, the results confirm strong involvement of ADH in 1,4-BD metabolism by human liver.",

The following drug concentrations were found using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry on autopsy samples and on a cup and a glass found at the scene: 20,350 mg/L (bottle) for 1,4-BD; 1020 mg/L (femoral blood), 3380 mg/L (cardiac blood), 47,280 mg/L (gastric content), and 570 mg/L (vitreous humor) for GHB. The concentration of GHB is difficult to interpret in forensic cases due to the possibility of an endogenous production of GHB. The variable tolerance of the user may also modify the peri- and postmortem GHB concentrations. This case underscores the need to have many different sources of toxicology samples analyzed to avoid the hypothesis of endogenous production of GHB.",

Accordingly, the present study investigates whether 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP; also termed fomepizole and Antizol), an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase (the enzyme involved in the first step of the conversion of 1,4-BD into GHB), and the gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptor antagonist (2S)(+)-5,5-dimethyl-2-morpholineacetic acid (SCH 50911), provides protection against 1,4-BD-induced mortality in CD1 mice. Two sets of experiments were conducted with mortality as the outcome measure. In all experiments, mice were initially treated with a lethal dose of 1,4-BD (3 g/kg, intragastric [i.g.]). In the first set of experiments (dose-response curves), once mice had displayed clear signs of 1,4-BD intoxication, animals were randomly allocated in separate groups (n=10) and treated acutely with either 4-MP (vehicle, 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]) or SCH 50911 (vehicle, 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg, i.p.). Mortality was recorded every hour for the first 9 hours and 12, 18, and 24 hours after 1,4-BD injection. In the second set of experiments (time course), mice were randomly allocated in separate groups (n=10). A single dose of either 4-MP (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or SCH 50911 (150 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes after administration of 3 g/kg 1,4-BD (i.g.). Again, mortality was recorded every hour for the first 9 hours and 12, 18, and 24 hours after 1,4-BD injection. In the dose-response experiments, the acute administration of 4-MP and SCH 50911 exerted a dose-dependent resuscitative effect in mice acutely intoxicated by 3 g/kg 1,4-BD. Specifically, 30 and 100 mg/kg 4-MP and 150 mg/kg SCH 50911 protected all treated mice against 1,4-BD-induced mortality. Conversely, all mice treated with 4-MP- and SCH 50911-vehicle died. In the time-course experiments, protection induced by 30 mg/kg 4-MP was complete when administered up to 90 minutes after 1,4-BD injection. Vice versa, the complete protection induced by 150 mg/kg SCH 50911 progressively diminished as the time between 1,4-BD and SCH 50911 administration was increased from 15 to 120 minutes. ...",

The following drug concentrations were found using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry on autopsy samples and on a cup and a glass found at the scene: 20,350 mg/L (bottle) for 1,4-BD; 1020 mg/L (femoral blood), 3380 mg/L (cardiac blood), 47,280 mg/L (gastric content), and 570 mg/L (vitreous humor) for GHB. The concentration of GHB is difficult to interpret in forensic cases due to the possibility of an endogenous production of GHB. The variable tolerance of the user may also modify the peri- and postmortem GHB concentrations. This case underscores the need to have many different sources of toxicology samples analyzed to avoid the hypothesis of endogenous production of GHB.",

We report a case of coma in a 20-month-old child after an ingestion of a toy containing 1,4-butanediol, an industrial solvent used to manufacture plastics. When ingested, 1,4-butanediol is metabolized to gamma-hydroxybutyrate, which can have significant systemic effects including death. Health care providers should suspect the possibility of a toxic component when a presumed nontoxic object causes unusual symptoms.",

Five male and five female rats were exposed once for 4 hours to 5.1 mg/L air as an aerosol with a mass specific median aerodynamic particle diameter of 1.9 um (geometric standard deviation 4.1). The observation period was 14 days. No deaths occurred and only mild respiratory symptoms were observed during and after exposure, which were no longer evident from the second day of observation. Body weight gain was not affected. No pathological effects were found at autopsy. The LC50 was therefore >5.1 mg/L air.",

In the acute exposure study, male Crl:CD-BR rats were exposed for single 4 hour periods to 4.6, 9.4, or 15.0 mg/L 1,4-butanediol in nose only exposure chambers; survivors were killed after a 14 day observation period. All rats survived 4 hour exposure to 4.6 or 9.4 mg/L 1,4-butanediol, but at 15 mg/L, one of ten exposed rats died 1 day post exposure. 1,4-Butanediol was considered to be only slightly toxic following acute exposure. In the repeat exposure studies, rats received nose only exposures of 0.20, 1.1, and 5.2 mg/L for 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk, for 2 wk. After the tenth exposure and after a 2 week recovery period, pathological and clinicochemical determinations were made. Although no adverse effects were exhibited by the two lower exposure groups, the highest exposure group exhibited depressed body weight after the third treatment and increased erythrocyte count and hematocrits along with decreased serum cholesterol concentrations after the last exposure, as well as atrophy of lymphoid cells in the thymus and depressed heart weight. No adverse effects were seen after 2 weeks of recovery. Both 0.20 and 1.1 mg/L were considered to be the no adverse effects concentrations; the highest concentration was associated with reversible systemic effects. ...",

Within 15 minutes after iv administration of 520 mg 1,4-butanediol per kilogram body weight to Sprague-Dawley rats, blood and brain concentrations of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (determined using gas chromatography) were significantly increased, and these concentrations continued to increase to a maximum that occurred approximately 60 minutes (blood) or 90 minutes (brain) after administration. This increase in gamma-hydroxybutyric acid blood and brain concentrations was accompanied by sleep onset 30 minutes after administration, and sleep continued until the gamma-hydroxybutyric acid concentration returned to normal (approximately 150 minutes after administration). Concomitant administration of 1,4-butanediol and 2 g beta-hydroxybutyric acid/kg, a compound which antagonizes gamma-hydroxybutyric acid sleep induction, resulted in antagonized sleep induction, shortened sleeping time, and lower brain gamma-hydroxybutyric acid concentration than that observed in rats after administration of 1,4-butanediol alone. In addition, both blood and brain gamma-hydroxybutyric acid concentrations were lower in animals that received beta-hydroxybutyric acid than in those given only 1,4-butanediol.",

Within the first 2 hours after administration of 4, 40, or 120 mg/kg, approximately 50% of the administered radiolabel was eliminated as 14CO2. After 4 hours, approximately 80% of the administered radiolabel had been eliminated as 14CO2, and at the end of the 72-hour recording period a total of 85% to 86% of the administered 1-[(14)C]-1,4-butanediol had been eliminated as 14CO2. 14CO2 accounted for 94% of the radiolabel recovered in excreta. Approximately 4% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine and 0.6% in the feces over the 72-hour collection period, with the majority of material excreted within the first 4 hours after administration. At 400 mg/kg, slight saturation of elimination was apparent at the early time points, as evidenced by somewhat slower formation of 14CO2; however, at later time points, the total production of 14CO2 was close to that observed at the lower doses. The distribution of radioactivity was also studied. Seventy-two hours after administration, a total of 2.28% of the dose remained in the carcass, with the largest amounts present in liver, muscle, and skin. The greatest concentration of test article per gram of tissue was in liver and skin. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation in any tissue. The results indicate that 1,4-butanediol is rapidly metabolized and excreted, primarily as CO2, clearly showing that conversion to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and succinic acid and processing through the tricarboxylic acid cycle is the major route of degradation.",

Intravenous administration of 520 mg 1,4-butanediol/kg containing [(14)C]-labeled material to male Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in the onset of sleep (behavioral arrest) within 23 minutes. Blood and brain [(14)C]gamma-hydroxybutyric acid concentrations increased rapidly and peaked within 60 minutes. Blood levels of 1,4-butanediol decreased rapidly after injection while brain levels increased for the first 15 minutes after injection but then decreased at approximately the same rate as the blood concentration. A brain concentration of 0.76 millimolar gamma-hydroxybutyric acid was found to correlate with the onset of sleep. ... Partial hepatectomy caused a significant reduction in the formation of [(14)C]-gamma-hydroxybutyric acid derived from radiolabeled 1,4-butanediol and reduced the length of 1,4-butanediol-induced sleep time, indicating that the liver is the major site where exogenously administered 1,4-butanediol is converted to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.0105 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,4-butanediol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,4-butanediol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 hours. 1,4-Butanediol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,4-butanediol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. 1,4-Butanediol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 83% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 1,4-butanediol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,4-butanediol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,4-butanediol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,4-butanediol via dermal contact with personal care products and inhalation of cigarette smoke condensate. Limited general exposure may occur with its use as an illicit drug. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 1,4-butanediol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.67X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec(3). 1,4-Butanediol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

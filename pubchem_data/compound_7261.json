No information is available regarding the chronic (long-term) or carcinogenic effects of toluene-2,4-diamine in humans. Chronic animal studies have reported liver injury. In animal studies, toluene-2,4-diamine was carcinogenic following dietary administration, producing a significant increase in the incidence of a large variety of tumor types, including liver, mammary gland, subcutaneous fibromas, lung lymphomas, and leukemia.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Acute (short-term) exposure to high levels of toluene-2,4-diamine in humans has caused severe skin and eye irritation sometimes leading to permanent blindness. Other effects include respiratory problems, stomach gas, rise in blood pressure, dizziness, convulsions, fainting, and coma. No information is available regarding the chronic (long-term) or carcinogenic effects of toluene-2,4-diamine in humans. Chronic animal studies have reported liver injury. In animal studies, toluene-2,4-diamine was carcinogenic following dietary administration, producing a significant increase in the incidence of a large variety of tumor types, including liver, mammary gland, subcutaneous fibromas, lung lymphomas, and leukemia. EPA has classified toluene-2,4-diamine as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Red precipitates were produced in a 2 day reaction mixture and were column chromatographed on silica gel. 5 Fractions having mutagenic potency were obtained. The red crystalline needles, obtained as the major reaction product, were separated from fraction 2 and were subjected to high resolution mass spectrometry, (1)H and (13)C NMR spectrometry. The structure of the compound was determined to be 2,7-diamino-3,8-dimethylphenazine from physicochemical and chemical evidence. The compound induced 212 revertants/nmole in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 with 25 uL S9 per plate.",

This product was only produced in the presence of methanol, and not other organic solvents. Isolation of this product showed that it was highly mutagenic in Salmonella TA98 with S9 activation. Characterization of the product of the interaction of methanol and 2,4-diaminotoluene indicated that methanol is activated to a reactive intermediate, probably formaldehyde by the 9000 X g supernatant used in the Ames/Salmonella assay. The formaldehyde subsequently reacts with 2,4-diaminotoluene to form the mutagenic product, identified as bis-5,5'(2,4,2',4-tetraaminotolyl)methane. Results of this study demonstrate that methanol may be an inappropriate solvent for mutation and metabolism studies of aromatic amines and possibly other chemicals, and that solvent xenobiotic interactions may in some cases lead to the misinterpretation of results.",

Examination of 84 workers and 119 unexposed subjects consisted of semen analysis, blood testing, medical examination, and an interview.  Seventy-two percent of non-vasectomized exposed workers provided semen samples. These groups of workers were defined by exposure intensity, frequency, and recency, and compared with controls. Although no significant differences in miscarriage rates were reported between exposure categories, the categories were as defined at the time of the study, not at the time of pregnancy. Fertility rates were reported to be unaffected by exposure, but no figures were given. There were no statistically significant differences in semen analysis, sperm count and morphology, and FSH levels, between the 3 exposure groups and unexposed workers.

Groups of 50 rats of each sex were admin 2,4-diaminotoluene at one of two doses, initially either 125 or 250 ppm, for 40 weeks. Because of excessive depression in the amount of mean body weight gained in both low- and high-dose groups, doses were then reduced to 50 and 100 ppm, respectively. Admin of 50 ppm to the low-dose groups was continued for 63 wk, and surviving animals in these groups were then killed. Surviving animals in the high-dose males and females admin 100 ppm were /sacrificed/ at the end of 39 and 44 weeks, respectively, due to morbidity. The time-weighted average dose was 79 ppm for the low-dose male and females for 103 wk, 176 ppm for the high-dose males for 79 wk, and 171 ppm for the high-dose females for 84 wk. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated rats of each sex. Groups of 50 mice of each sex were admin 2,4-diaminotoluene at one of two doses, either 100 or 200 ppm, for 101 wk. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated mice of each sex. Surviving mice were /sacrificed/ at the end of admin of the test chemical. Under the conditions of this bioassay, 2,4-diaminotoluene was carcinogenic for F344 rats, inducing hepatocellular carcinomas or neoplastic nodules in both males and females and carcinomas or adenomas of the mammary gland in females. The test chemical was also carcinogenic for female B6C3F1 mice, inducing hepatocellular carcinomas. The incidence of lymphomas in the female mice suggested that these tumors may also have been related to admin of the test chemical. ...

The doses selected for evaluation of the immune system as a target for toxicity were 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg. From probe studies, doses of 100 mg/kg/day for 14 days had lethal actions in the B6C3F1 mouse; thus, the high dose used in the immunotoxicity evaluation is considered to be a maximum tolerated dose for 14 days of oral exposure. 2,4-Diaminotoluene, at doses between 25 and 100 mg/kg per day for 14 days by gavage, targeted the hepatic and immune system. ... Mice exposed to 2,4-diaminotoluene in doses up to 100 mg/kg for 14 days by gastric gavage showed no change in body weight and only a slight decrease in body weight gain. There was a 41.8% increase in liver weight and a slight decrease in spleen weight. The only gross pathology observed was an increase in liver size. Histopathology evaluation of selected organs showed the liver to be the major target with morphological changes. The changes were dose-dependent with the high dose (100 mg/kg) being associated with moderate centrilobular necrosis. No abnormal structure was noted in the spleen, lungs, thymus, kidney or mesenteric lymph nodes. The liver toxicity was associated with elevation in SGPT levels The only change noted in selected hematological parameters was a 63.8% increase in peripheral blood leukocytes which may be a response to the liver damage. ... 2,4-Diaminotoluene, administered by gastric gavage in doses between 25 and 100 mg/kg, was associated with a number of immunological changes. The IgM and IgG response to the T-dependent sRBC represents a comprehensive assay requiring appropriate participation of T and B cells and appropriate production of the various interleukins. Mice exposed to 2,4-diaminotoluene showed a decreased IgM and IgG response to sRBC. The deficient immunoglobulin response was associated with a decrease in spleen cell number. Thus, IgM & IgG responses were not significantly changed when expressed on a per spleen cell basis but the response was decreased on a whole spleen basis. The decrease was not a function of a decreased number of B cells since the number of B cells increased dose-dependently. Proliferative capacity of the immunocompetent cells was not affected by exposure to 2,4-diaminotoluene as measured by response to the mitogens (Concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide) and allogeneic cells (MLR). The delayed hypersensitivity response to KLH represents a holistic assay measuring most functions associated with cell-mediated immunity. The DHR response to KLH in mice exposed to 2,4-diaminotoluene was increased. This may be a compensatory action in response to the decrease in antibody production and NK cell activity. Natural Killer Cell activity was decreased dose-dependently and may be a spleen cell pool shift since the number of B cells increased in the presence of a decreasing spleen size. One of the serum complement components, C3, was suppressed dose-dependently. Phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages was unaffected by 2,4-diaminotoluene exposure, but the macrophages of the spleen were suppressed. Phagocytic ability of the Kupffer cells was unchanged although the data indicates an increased number of Kupffer cells. ... Two bacterial and two tumor host resistance models were employed in these studies. 2,4-Diaminotoluene exposure for 14 days decreased host resistance to the bacterial challenge, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes. The decrease may be related to the decrease in serum complement (C3) and spleen phagocytosis, respectively. Host resistance to the pulmonary tumor model, B16F10, and the PYB6 Fibrosarcoma were unaffected by 2,4-diaminotoluene exposure. The lowest dose that produced an immunological effect was 50 mg/kg which was seen in the number of B cells and Natural Killer Cell activity. Thus, the no effect level is 25 mg/kg for a 14 day exposure. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.70X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates toluene-2,4-diamine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase toluene-2,4-diamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours. Particulate-phase toluene-2,4-diamine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Toluene-2,4-diamine absorbs light at wavelengths of 294 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, toluene-2,4-diamine is expected to have low mobility based upon Koc values of 1331 and 1346. The estimated pKa of toluene-2,4-diamine is 5.35, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Toluene-2,4-diamine may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing a shake flask test and soil inoculum, 35% 14-CO2 evolution was reached in 375 days indicating that biodegradation is a slow environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, toluene-2,4-diamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated pKa of 5.35 indicates toluene-2,4-diamine will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. A BCF range of 1.9-3.3 suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to toluene-2,4-diamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where toluene-2,4-diamine is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to toluene-2,4-diamine via dermal contact with consumer products containing toluene-2,4-diamine. (SRC)",

Aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(8,9), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). Volatilization of toluene-2,4-diamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(5). Toluene-2,4-diamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.70X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(6).

Vapor-phase toluene-2,4-diamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.92X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Particulate-phase toluene-2,4-diamine may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Toluene-2,4-diamine absorbs light at wavelengths of>294 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Under anaerobic conditions, Koc values were 713 and 1054, respectively(1). According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that toluene-2,4-diamine is expected to have low mobility in soil. The estimated pKa of toluene-2,4-diamine is 5.35(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(5,6), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC).",

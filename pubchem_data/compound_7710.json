When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It is not registered for current pesticide use in the U.S., but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: A maximization test was carried out on 25 volunteers. Dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone was tested at a concentration of 10% in petrolatum and produced no sensitization reactions. Tested at 10% in petrolatum, Dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone produced no irritation after a 48 hr closed-patch test on human subjects. ANIMAL STUDIES: A 90-day feeding study on 15 male and 15 female rats fed 0 or 67.5 mg/kg Dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone body wt/day showed no adverse effect. 0.1-0.5% Dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone fed to groups of 20 male and female rats in diet for 2 yr produced no effects. In a 2-wk study, 61.4 mg/kg Dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone fed to rats in the diet produced no effects. Gamma-nonalactone applied full strength to intact or abraded rabbit skin for 24 hr under occlusion was slightly irritating.",

Animals were wrapped with binders of rubber dam, gauze and adhesive tape. Following exposure, the binders were removed and observations made for mortality and toxic effects for a period of 7 days. Gross necropsy was performed on all animals at the termination of the study. During the observation period, one animal died on Day 2.

Its use in perfumery will result in its direct release to the environment.  Dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone has been reported in several plants and fruits. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.2X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 40 hours. Dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 120. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using a Closed Bottle test, dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone achieved 71% biodegradation in activated sewage sludge after 28 days, suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 hours and 7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. By analogy to gamma-butyolactone, which exhibits a hydrolysis half-life of approximately 28 days at pH7, dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone is expected to hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone via ingestion of food containing dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone via dermal contact with consumer products containing dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 hours and 7 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 11(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.08(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). By analogy to gamma-butyolactone, which exhibits a hydrolysis half-life of approximately 28 days at pH7, dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone is expected to hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9).

Vapor-phase dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 40 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 9.7X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 40 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). By analogy to gamma-butyolactone, which exhibits a hydrolysis half-life of approximately 28 days at pH7(2), dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone is expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment(SRC). Dihydro-5-pentyl-2(3H)-furanone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

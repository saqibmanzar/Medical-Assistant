When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Terphenyl, unspecified isomers, also occurs naturally in petroleum oil. If released to the atmosphere, m-terphenyl will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere based on a vapor pressure of 1.75X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C, extrapolated from experimentally-derived coefficients. Vapor-phase m-terphenyl is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 30 hours. Particulate-phase m-terphenyl may be physically removed from the air by dry deposition. An estimated Koc of 3500 suggests that m-terphenyl will have slight mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-6 atm cu m/mol, but not significantly from dry soil surfaces given m-terphenyl's vapor pressure. Based on limited data, m-terphenyl may aerobically biodegrade in soil and water. m-Terphenyl present in a waste water mixture, inoculated with three bacterial species, was completely biodegraded after an incubation period of 130 hours. m-Terphenyl may adsorb to suspended matter in the water based on its Koc value. This compound is expected to volatilize from water surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 120 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 500 suggests that m-terphenyl may bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. Occupatinal exposure may occur through dermal contact at workplaces where terephenyl's are produced or used. (SRC)",

Based on limited data m-terphenyl may biodegrade in water(SRC). m-Terphenyl present in a waste water mixture, inoculated with three bacterial species, was completely biodegraded after an incubation period of 130 hours(3). m-Terphenyl should volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), determined from experimental values for vapor pressure(4) and water solubility(2). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 120 days, respectively(1,SRC). An estimated BCF value of 500(1,SRC), from a measured water solubility(2), suggests that m-terphenyl may bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC), according to a recommended classification scheme(5).",

Vapor-phase m-terphenyl is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 30 hours(3,SRC). Particulate-phase m-terphenyl may be physically removed from the air by dry deposition(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This value indicates that m-terphenyl will volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 16 days(3,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 120 days(3,SRC). Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is possible given this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2,SRC), but not from dry soil surfaces(SRC), based on m-terphenyl's vapor pressure(1).",

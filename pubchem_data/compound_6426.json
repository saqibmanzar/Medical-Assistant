PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /CFCs and HCFCs/",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The original Montreal Protocol was agreed on 16 September 1987 and entered into force on 1 January 1989. The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(v) and 2.125(e)(4)(iv) is effective December 31, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(iii) is effective June 30, 2011.

Additionally, since ozone-depleting substances persist in the air for long periods of time, the past use of these substances continues to affect the ozone layer today. We must also continue to ensure that the alternatives being brought to the market support the country's long-term environmental goals in a cost-effective manner.[EPA; Achievements in Stratospheric Ozone Protection Progress Report, Available from, as of March 11, 2013: http://www.epa.gov/ozone/downloads/spd-annual-report_final.pdf]",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 60 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1,1,2-tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. It will gradually diffuse into the stratosphere (diffusion half-life 20 years) where it will either photolyze or react with singlet oxygen. The stratospheric lifetime is predicted to be on the order of several decades. Due to its persistence in the troposphere, long distance transport from its emission sources is expected to occur. If released to soil, 1,1,1,2-tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-1 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1,1,2-Tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Structurally similar compounds have been shown to biodegrade under anaerobic conditions, but are generally slow to degrade under aerobic conditions. If released into water, 1,1,1,2-tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane is expected to moderately adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.5 hrs and 5.7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 82 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to 1,1,1,2-tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane may have occurred through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1,1,2-tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane was produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,1,1,2-tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

As a result, it will disperse and slowly diffuse to the stratosphere, a process that may take decades(3). By analogy to other chlorofluorocarbons(5), 1,1,1,2-tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane will slowly photolyze in the stratosphere, releasing chlorine atoms which in turn are responsible for removing ozone(4). While some 1,1,1,2-tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane may be lost from the atmosphere by being scavenged by rain, any loss will be returned to the atmosphere by volatilization(SRC). 1,1,1,2-Tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane does not contain any chromophores that absorb solar radiation >290 nm and, therefore, it is not susceptible to direct photolysis in the troposphere(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 1,1,1,2- tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 1.5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5.7 days(SRC). 1,1,1,2-Tetrachloro-2,2-difluoroethane's estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

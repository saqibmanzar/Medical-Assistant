PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The recovery of radioactivity was 5.3% in the urine, 46% in the feces exclusively as L-sorbose 16% as carbon dioxide. Caloric utilization was approximately 25%. A second group of 3 rats that had previously received L-sorbose in their diet showed (14)C recoveries of 8.9% in the urine, 6.6% in the feces and 59% as carbon dioxide. The time course of expired carbon dioxide suggests that a portion of L-sorbose was rapidly absorbed and partially metabolized while the principal pathway involved fermentation by the intestinal microflora to volatile fatty acids which were subsequently absorbed and metabolized. The total caloric utilization of L-sorbose was estimated to be 70%. It was observed that a human intestinal microflora also required an adaptation period in order to ferment this sugar. The efficiency of the fermentation was estimated to be 70%.",

ANIMAL STUDIES: Daily oral admin of L-sorbose to dogs (2.5-20% in diet) for 13 wk caused acute hemolytic anemia. However, there was no hemolytic effect of L-sorbose on canine erythrocytes characterized by inherited high Na, K-ATPase activity and a high potassium concentration. Sorbose was relatively non-toxic for other types of canine cells in vitro.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

At 30 degrees C the Ki of pentobarbital for inhibition of Vmax of zero-trans net glucose exit is 2.16 +/-0 .14 mM; the affinity of the external site of the transporter for D-glucose is also reduced to 50% of control by 1.66 +/- 0.06 mM pentobarbital. Pentobarbital reduces the temperature coefficient of D-glucose binding to the external site. Pentobarbital (4 mM) reduces the enthalpy of D-glucose interaction from 49.3 +/- 9.6 to 16.24 +/- 5.50 kJ/mol (P<0.05). Pentobarbital (8 mM) increases the activation energy of glucose exit from control 54.7 +/- 2.5 kJ/mol to 114 +/- 13 kJ/mol (P<0.01). Pentobarbital reduces the rate of L-sorbose exit from human red cells, in the temperature range 45 degrees C-30 degrees C (P<0.001). On cooling from 45 degrees C to 30 degrees C, in the presence of pentobarbital (4 mM), the Ki (sorbose, glucose) decreases from 30.6 +/- 7.8 mM to 14 +/- 1.9 mM; whereas in control cells, Ki (sorbose, glucose) increases from 6.8 +/- 1.3 mM at 45 degrees C to 23.4 +/ -4.5 mM at 30 degrees C (P<0.002). Thus, the glucose inhibition of sorbose exit is changed from an endothermic process (enthalpy change=+60.6 +/- 14.7 kJ/mol) to an exothermic process (enthalpy change=-43 +/- 6.2 7 kJ/mol) by pentobarbital (4 mM) (P<0.005). These findings indicate that pentobarbital acts by preventing glucose-induced conformational changes in glucose transporters by binding to 'non-catalytic' sites in the transporter.",

This effect is probably the consequence of an ATP depletion of the red blood cells subsequent to inhibition of hexokinase, and thus the glycolytic pathway, by sorbose 1-phosphate. In the present study, the susceptibility of dog erythrocytes to D-tagatose, a stereoisomer of L-sorbose, was examined. Washed dog erythrocytes were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, containing 5.6 mM glucose) with or without the addition of 0.6, 6, and 60 mM L-sorbose or D-tagatose, or in HBSS with total glucose concentrations of 5.6, 6 and 60 mM D-glucose. After incubation for 24 hr at 34 degrees C, the suspensions were centrifuged, and the percentage of hemolysis was determined by measuring the hemoglobin in the sediment and the supernatant. The amount of hemoglobin released in the medium did not differ significantly between the control (HBSS) and the test incubations with glucose or D-tagatose supplementation. In contrast, the addition of 6 and 60 mM L-sorbose resulted in significant hemolysis. At the low dose (0.6 mM), L-sorbose did not have an adverse effect. It is concluded that D-tagatose, unlike L-sorbose, does not have a hemolytic effect on canine erythrocytes.",

Sorbose has been detected at trace levels in cocoa beans and several other plants and fruits. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.2X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates sorbose will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase sorbose will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Sorbose absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, sorbose is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-15 atm-cu m/mole. Sorbose is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. By analogy to similar compounds, biodegradation is expected to be the important fate process in soil and water. Sorbose is a monosaccharide and these types of monosaccharides are classified as readily biodegradable. Monosaccharides rapidly mineralize in tropical and boreal forest soils; under laboratory conditions, the mineralization residence times range from 0.4-1.9 hours. If released into water, sorbose is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to sorbose via ingestion of foods and dermal contact with consumer products containing sorbose. (SRC)",

Volatilization of sorbose from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-15 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its estimated vapor pressure, 5.2X10-9 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 3.6X10+5 mg/L(3). Sorbose is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(2). Sorbose absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight on soil surfaces(SRC). By analogy to similar compounds, the dominant fate process in soil is expected to be biodegradation(SRC). Sorbose is a monosaccharide sugar, and these types of monosaccharides are classified as readily biodegradable(5). Monosaccharides rapidly mineralize in tropical and boreal forest soils(6); under laboratory conditions, the mineralization residence times range from 0.4-1.9 hours(6).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-15 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its estimated vapor pressure, 5.2X10-9 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 3.6X10+5 mg/L(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -1.46(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). By analogy to similar compounds, the dominant fate process in water is expected to be biodegradation(SRC). Sorbose is a monosaccharide sugar, and these types of monosaccharides are classified as readily biodegradable(6). Monosaccharides rapidly mineralize in tropical and boreal forest soils(7); under laboratory conditions, the mineralization residence times range from 0.4-1.9 hours(7). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

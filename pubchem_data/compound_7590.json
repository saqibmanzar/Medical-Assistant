When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Aglianico wine from the Italian region \"Basilicata\" is an example of a promising product strictly connected to the territory; nevertheless, it is affected by a frequent sweet-like off-flavor. In this study the compositional cause of this off-flavor was investigated by SPME-GC-olfactometry, SPME-GC-MS, and sensory tests. Ethyl phenylacetate (EPhA) was found to be the compound mainly responsible, and its sensory threshold was determined near 73 ug/L; products with the odorant concentration near and up to these values were always recognized as significantly different from the other wines and were often far from wine technical pleasantness; besides EPhA gave to the wines a strong honey-like character. Some preliminary hypotheses about its mechanism of formation (shikimate pathway) are presented in this study: these hypotheses could explain the correlation between EPhA and volatile phenols that was found by both sensory tests and GC quantitative analysis of wines affected by different levels of defect.",

The effect of sour rot was tested in monovarietal wines produced with the Portuguese red grape variety Trincadeira and in blends of Cabernet Sauvignon and sour rotten Trincadeira grapes. Wines produced from damaged berries exhibited clear honey-like notes not evoked by healthy samples. Ethyl phenylacetate (EPhA) and phenylacetic acid (PAA), both exhibiting sweet honey-like aromas, emerged as key aroma compounds of sour rotten wines. Their levels were 1 order of magnitude above those found in controls and reached 304 and 1668 ug/L of EPhA and PAA, respectively, well above the corresponding odor thresholds. Levels of gamma-nonalactone also increased by a factor 3 in sour rot samples. Results also suggest that sour rot exerts a great effect on the secondary metabolism of yeast, decreasing the levels of volatiles related to fatty acids and amino acid synthesis. The highest levels of gamma-decalactone of up to 405 ug/L were also found in all of the samples, suggesting that this could be a relevant aroma compound in Trincadeira wine aroma.",

It was not sensitizing in guinea pigs. In a mutagenesis study with the Salmonella strains TA92, TA1535, TA100, TA1537, TA94, TA98 and for some samples TA2637 with and without metabolic activation no mutagenic effects were observed."

Also its intrinsic color was not intensive. Consequently, additional tests with freeze-killed or viable tissues were not necessary. Each three tissues of the human skin model EpiDerm were treated with the test item, the negative or the positive control for 60 minutes. Each 30 uL of the test item, of the negative control (DPBS), and of the positive control (5% SLS) were applied to each tissue and spread to match the surface of the tissue.  After treatment with the negative control the absorbance values were well in the required range of the acceptability criterion of mean OD = 0.8 and = 2.8 for the 60 minutes treatment interval, thus assuring the quality of the tissues.

Its use in perfumery will result in its direct release to the environment. Ethyl phenylacetate is a volatile aroma component of fruit and honey. It is a constituent of various fruit and fruit juices, and some wines, and is a component of various plant species and plant parts. It is a component of human expired air. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.24X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl phenylacetate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl phenylacetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.2 days. Ethyl phenylacetate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethyl phenylacetate is expected to have high mobility based upon measured Koc values of 78, 110, and 129. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.88X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyl phenylacetate has an estimated vapor pressure of 6.24X10-2 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, ethyl phenylacetate may volatilize from dry soil. Utilizing the Closed Bottle test, 78% degradation was reached in 28 days indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, ethyl phenylacetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.7 days and 23 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 15 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate process in alkaline soils and water. Occupational exposure to ethyl phenylacetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl phenylacetate is produced or used. Limited monitoring data and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ethyl phenylacetate via ingestion of food, smoking cigarettes and inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing ethyl phenylacetate.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

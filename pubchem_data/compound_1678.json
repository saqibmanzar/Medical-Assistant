ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Thus, ... the effect of orphenadrine ... on N-methyl-D-aspartate neurotoxicity in both cultured rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) & in rats /was studied/. Orphenadrine protected cerebellar granule cells from N-methyl-D-aspartate induced mortality, as assessed by both the neutral red viability assay & laser scanning cytometry, using propidium iodide staining. For rats, two indirect markers of neuronal damage were used: the binding of ((3)H)-PK 11195 to the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a microglial marker, & expression of the 27 kD heat shock protein (HSP27), a marker of activated astroglia. Systemic admin of N-methyl-D-aspartate (30 mg/kg/day for 3 days) induced a 170% incr in ((3)H)-PK 11195 binding, & expression of 27 kD heat shock protein. Both the incr in ((3)H)-PK 11195 & HSP 27 expression were prevented by previous admin of 30 mg/kg/day of orphenadrine for 3 days. Lower doses (10 & 20 mg/kg) had no protective effect. Orphenadrine also reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate induced mortality in a dose dependent manner. ... Orphenadrine or orphenadrine like drugs could be used to treat neurodegenerative disorders mediated by overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.",

Since the endothelial cells are important components of the BBB and the first target of a systemic intoxication, in the present study, the effect of 3-NPA on primary cultured rat brain endothelial cells (rBECs) was examined by studying intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) response using imaging techniques. Data indicate that a medium to high concentration of 3-NPA induces damage on rBECs as revealed by an accumulation of [Ca2+]i, but the damage was protected by cotreatment with 17 beta-estradiol or tamoxifen, suggesting that estrogen may be protective for the brain vascular damage via estrogen receptor.",

An inhibitor of mitochondrial complex III, 3-nitropropionic acid, which is known to evoke convulsions per se, and was used here in subthreshold dose, enhanced seizures generated by electric current and application of 4-aminopyridine. In contrast, 3-nitropropionic acid did not affect convulsions induced by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonists - bicuculline, pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin, glycine antagonist - strychnine, cholinomimetic drug-pilocarpine, and kynurenine aminotransferase inhibitor - aminooxyacetic acid. It is hypothesised that deranged mitochondrial metabolism renders the central nervous system more susceptible to factors inducing seizures via direct depolarization.",

It is well  established that Huntington's disease is associated with perturbation of mitochondrial energy  metab. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a naturally occurring bile acid, can stabilize the  mitochondrial membrane, inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition, decrease free radical  formation, & derail apoptotic pathways. Here we report that tauroursodeoxycholic acid  significantly reduced 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) mediated striatal neuronal cell death in  cell culture, In addition, rats treated with tauroursodeoxycholic acid exhibited an 80%  reduction in apoptosis & in lesion volumes associated with 3-nitropropionic acid admin.  Moreover, rats which received a combination of tauroursodeoxycholic acid + 3-nitropropionic  acid exhibited sensor/motor & cognitive task performance that was indistinguishable from that  of controls, & this effect persisted at least 6 months. Bile acids have traditionally been  used as therapeutic agents for certain liver diseases. This is the first demonstration,  however, that a bile acid can be delivered to the brain & function as a neuroprotectant & thus  may offer potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of certain neurodegenerative  diseases.",

Ex vivo and in vivo  1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy /were used/ in rat & primate models of progressive striatal  degeneration induced by the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionate (3NP) to determine whether  early N-acetylaspartate depletions could also be associated with neuronal dysfunction. In rats  that were treated for 3 days with 3-nitropropionate & had motor symptoms, the authors found a  significant decr in N-acetylaspartate concns, specifically restricted to the striaturn. No  cell loss or dying cells were found at this stage in these animals. After 5 days of  3-nitropropionate treatment, a further decr in striatal N-acetylaspartate concns was observed  in association with the occurrence of dying neurons in the dorsolateral striatum. In  3-nitropropionate treated primates, a similar striatal selective & early decr in  N-acetylaspartate concns was observed after only a few wks of neurotoxic treatment, without  any sign of ongoing cell death. This early decr in striatal N-acetylaspartate was partially  reversed after 4 wks of 3-nitropropionate withdrawal. These results demonstrate that early  N-acetylaspartate depletions reflect a reversible state of neuronal dysfunction preceding cell  degeneration & suggest that in vivo quantification of N-acetylaspartate 1H-magnetic resonance  spectroscopy may become a valuable tool for assessing early neuronal dysfunction & the effects  of potential neuroprotective therapies in neurodegenerative disorders.",

In vitro, 3-nitropropionic acid irreversibly inactivates succinate dehydrogenase, a  Complex 11 respiratory enzyme required for mitochondrial energy production. A single dose of  3-nitropropionic acid (30 mg/kg s.c.) was given to singly caged adult male Sprague Dawley  rats. Rectal temperature was measured after dosing as a potential biomarker of exposure to  3-nitropropionic acid, & animals were sacrificed at various times after 3-nitropropionic acid  exposure for histochemical visualization of succinate dehydrogenase activity. 3-Nitropropionic  acid treated rats experienced a progressive hypothermia, which reached a loss of 3 \u00b0C or  more in core body temperature by 3 hr after dosing. The optical density of the succinate  dehydrogenase stain in brain was reduced according to a similar time course, most prominently  in the cerebellum & least sharply in the thalamus. The caudate nucleus had the greatest  density of succinate dehydrogenase staining that we measured in brain; it also has been  reported to be the region most consistently lesioned by 3-nitropropionic acid. However, within  other areas of brain such as subdivisions of the hippocampus, neither endogenous succinate  dehydrogenase activity nor its sensitivity to inhibition by 3-nitropropionic acid could  predict the susceptibility to neurodegenerative changes. Although succinate dehydrogenase  activity remained significantly reduced in most areas of brain (except thalamus) for up to 5  days after dosing, core temperatures had returned to control values by 5 days suggesting that  animals can utilize an alternate method of heat production to withstand insult by  3-nitropropionic acid.",

Here we show that 10 wk  & 8 month old BALB/c ByJ mice show an unexpected striatal resilience to single & multiple  systemic injections of 3-nitropropionic acid, while Sprague Dawley rats are vulnerable, albeit  in a variable manner. Identification of lesions was made by staining of DNA fragmentation with  terminal deoxytransferase mediated dUTPbiotinnick end labeling (TUNEL) & hematoxylin/eosin,  1-10 days after injection. Quantitative imaging of histochemistry for succinate dehydrogenase  (SDH) activity, the target of 3-nitropropionic acid inhibition, revealed that vulnerable rats  reached maximal inhibition in brain at 1 day after 3-nitropropionic acid, whereas mice &  resilient rats took 7 days to reach maximal inhibition. All groups of animals reached similar  maximal decreases in succinate dehydrogenase activity in striatum & cortex. Remarkably, only  the fast decline in succinate dehydrogenase activity seen in vulnerable rats was associated  with dUTPbiotinnick end labeling labeling. In addition, vulnerable rats developed a region  within striatum where succinate dehydrogenase activity was fully depleted & a similarly  depleted region in CAI hippocampus. While mice did not develop this region in striatum, some  developed one in CAI. These regions of succinate dehydrogenase depletion in both structures  were associated with widespread dUTPbiotinnick end labeling staining, with maximal labeling at  3 days after 3-nitropropionic acid. The existence of an animal strain resilient to  3-nitropropionic acid suggests that there are mediating factors involved in the preferential  vulnerability of striatum to metabolic lesioning. The identification of these factors could  provide strategies for therapeutic intervention in Huntington's disease.",

The activity of brain succinate dehydrogenase was quantified spectrophotometrically in caudate  nucleus (CN), frontal cortex (FC), & hippocampus (HIP) 60 min after the 3-nitropropionic acid  injection. The succinate dehydrogenase activity in the animals treated with 3-nitropropionic  acid alone was 38% (CN), 50% (FC), & 36% (HIP) that of saline controls. Pretreatment with LC  prior to 3-nitropropionic acid injection attenuated decreases of succinate dehydrogenase  activity by approx 15 & 29% (LC low & high dose, respectively). Despite the attenuation of  succinate dehydrogenase inhibition, the activity of succinate dehydrogenase in these regions  remained significantly lower in treated than in control rats (p<0.05). It appears that the  protective effect of LC against 3-nitropropionic acid induced oxidative stress cannot be  explained by the direct action of LC to interfere with the succinate dehydrogenase inhibition  but are rather achieved by LC actions downstream of the succinate dehydrogenase inhibition.",

Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex were admin 3-nitropropionic acid at one of the following doses by gavage 5 days/wk. For male rats, the doses were 0.425 or 0.85 mg/animal/day; for females, they were 0.6 or 1.2 mg/animal/day. For both sexes of mice, the doses were 0.375 or 0.75 mg/animal/day. The rats were admin the test chemical for 110 wk and the mice for 104 wk. The controls consisted of 50 untreated rats and 50 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving rats were /sacrificed/ at 111 wk and all surviving mice at 104-105 wk. Mean body weights and mortality of the dosed animals were not markedly affected by 3-nitropropionic acid under the conditions of this bioassay, indicating that the maximum tolerated dose may not have been reached. The various clinical signs observed were common to both dosed and control groups. In rats, the combination of neoplastic nodule of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma occurred in the males with a significant dose related trend (p=0.010) and with a higher incidence (p=0.012) in the high dose group of animals than in the controls (controls 0/49, low dose 3/50, high dose 6/49). All but one of these tumors were neoplastic nodules. In the females, only two neoplastic nodules occurred, one in each of the dosed groups. Biliary hyperplasia occurred at a higher incidence in dosed males than in the corresponding controls (controls 19/50, low dose 32/50, high dose 36/50), but the incidence of this lesion in dosed females was not incr as compared with controls. There was also a dose related trend (p=0.033) in the incidence of pancreatic islet cell adenoma in male rats (controls 4/49, low dose 6/50, high dose 11/50); however, direct comparisons of incidences in the dosed and control groups were not statistically significant. The historical incidence of pancreatic islet cell adenoma among 100 control Fischer 344 rats at the laboratory was 7/100 (7%). In addition, focal myocardial fibrosis was observed at a higher incidence in dosed rats than among controls (males: controls 1/4, low dose 17/49, high dose 24/48; females: controls 2/48, low dose 9/46, high dose 9/50. In mice, each type of neoplasm found in the dosed and control mice has been encountered previously as a spontaneous lesion. No specific tumor was found to occur at a statistically higher incidence among dosed mice than among the respective control group. It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, there was an elevated incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms, primarily benign, and of islet cell adenomas of the pancreas in male Fischer 344 rats receiving 3-nitropropionic acid as compared with controls; however, there was no conclusive evidence that 3-nitropropionic acid was carcinogenic in these animals. The chemical was not carcinogenic in female rats or in male or female B6C3F1 mice. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: Male Rats: Equivocal; Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Negative; Female Mice: Negative.",

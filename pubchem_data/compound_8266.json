When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Biliary excretion was the primary route of removal of radioactivity from the liver, which occurred with a half-life of 1.19 hr. The blood contained 20% of the administered radioactivity at 1 hr, and this declined with a half-life of 0.84 hr. Muscle contained 14% of the administered radioactivity at 15 min, and this level fell rapidly, with a half-life of 0.57 hr. Smaller amounts were detected in other organs. The highest specific activity per gram of tissue (wet weight) was noted in the adrenal gland early after administration. Administration of the same solution of (14)C chlorendic acid by oral intubation resulted in a somewhat higher liver concentration and a lower blood concentration at 24 hr than those seen after the same time following intravenous administration. The majority of the radioactivity was found in the feces (78% of the total dose) or large intestine.",

More than 90% of the radiolabel was excreted within 24 hr in the feces, mainly in a conjugated form. Only 3-6% was excreted in the urine. The highest concentrations of radiolabel were found in adipose tisue, liver, kidneys, whole blood and lung. ... The acute oral toxicity /for the rat/ is low ... Chlorendic acid and anhydride are skin irritants and severe eye and respiratory tract irritants in the rabbit. ... Chlorendic acid was tested for mutagenic potential ... in Salmonella typhimurium in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolism system. Negative results were obtained ... A mouse lymphoma mutation assay in the absence of an exogenous metabolism system was positive. ... Chlorendic acid was positive in a transformation assay using BALB/c3T3 cells without metabolic activation ... Chlorendic acid did not give an increase of replicative DNA synthesis after oral or subcutaneous application ... to rats. ... Chlorendic acid was tested for carcinogenic potential in ... rats ... In addition to significant non-neoplastic changes in a number of organs, such as cystic degeneration and focal cellular changes, and bile duct hyperplasia in the liver, increases in the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas ... and carcinomas, significant at the highest dose level, ... were found. Furthermore, slight increases in acinar cell adenomas of the pancreas and alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas in the lung were found ... Chlorendic acid tested in ... mice ... showed an increased incidence of necrosis and mitotic alteration in the liver. An increase in the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was found ... An increased incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas was found ... Tests showed that chlorendic acid has promoting activity. ... Data on the exposure of humans and of organisms in the environment are lacking. Both substances /chlorendic acid and its anhydride/ seem to have low acute and subacute oral toxicity, but they are dermal, eye, and respiratory irritants. From the results of long term toxicity/carcinogenicity studies with chlorendic acid on rats and mice, it is concluded that chlorendic acid induces tumors in rats and mice and is, therefore, considered to have a carcinogenic potential. However, a full hazard assessment for humans and the environment cannot be made in view of the lack of data.",

The test atmosphere was generated by passing metered houseline air or nitrogen through a three-neck flask containing the test material heated to 100 \u00b0C. Mortality was observed in one animal in the 0.066-mg/L group, all six in the 0.102-mg/L group, three in the 0.065-mg/L group, and all six in the 0.095-mg/L group. The approximate lethal concentration was reported to be 0.066 mg/L under nitrogen and 0.095 mg/L under air. Clinical observations included lacrimation, irregular breathing, paleness, gasping, congestion, bloody nose, hyperemia and weight loss. Histopathological examination revealed severe pulmonary irritation.",

The estimated mean daily consumption of chlorendic acid was 27 and 56 mg/kg body weight for low dose male rats and 39 and 66 mg/kg for low dose and high dose female rats. Survival and feed consumption of dosed male and female rats ... were similar to those of controls. Mean body weights of high dose male and female rats ... were lower than those of controls. Mean body weights of high dose female rats 16%-24% lower than those of controls during the second half of the study. Incidences of nonneoplastic lesion of the liver in dosed male rats (cystic degeneration) and dosed female rats (granulomatous inflammation, pigmentation, and bile duct hyperplasia) were increased. The incidences of neoplastic nodules of the liver were significantly increased in dosed male rats (control, 2/50; low dose, 21/50; high dose, 23/50) and high dose female rats (1/50; 3/49; 11/50). The incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was also increased in high dose female rats (0/50; 3/49; 5/50). The incidences of acinar cell hyperplasia (0/49; 4/50; 4/50) and acinar cell adenomas (0/49; 4/50; 6/50) of the pancreas were increased in dose male rats relative to those of contols. Pancreatic acinar cell adenoma is an uncommon neoplasm in intreated control F344/N rats in NTP studies (3/1667). In dosed male rats, incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas of a the lung (0/50; 3/50; 5/50) were increased. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas of carcinomas (combined) in dosed female mice were also increased (1/50;5/50; 6/50). Preputial gland carcinomas occurred at a greater incidence in low dose male rats (1/50;8/50; 4/50) than in controls. An adenoma and a squamous cell papilloma were observed in two low dose male rats. The incidences of sarcomas, fibrosarcomas, or neurofibrosarcomas (combined) of the salivary gland (1/50;2/49;4/50) were increased in dosed male rats. The incidences in the dosed groups were not significantly different from that in the controls, but these tumors are uncommon in F344/N rats receiving no treatment (3/1689). There was clear evidence of carcinogenicity of chlorendic acid for male F344/N rats as shown by increased incidences of neoplastic nodules of the liver and acinar cell adenomas of the pancreas. Increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and preputial gland carcinomas may also have been related to the administration of chlorendic acid. There was clear evidence of carcinogenicity of chlorendic acid for female F344/N rats as shown by increased incidences of neoplastic nodules and of carcinomas of the liver.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.4X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chlorendic acid will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase chlorendic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, chlorendic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 49. The pKa of chlorendic acid is 3.1, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in anion form and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.0X10-14 atm-cu m/mole. Chlorendic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Based on data from several screening studies, chlorendic acid is not expected to biodegrade rapidly in soil or water environments. If released into water, chlorendic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. In addition, as chlorendic acid will exist almost entirely as the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. BCF values of <2.1 and <0.22, measured in fish, indicate that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups.Occupational exposure to chlorendic acid may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chlorendic acid is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to chlorendic acid via dermal contact with consumer products containing chlorendic acid. (SRC)",

The pKa of chlorendic acid is 3.1(7), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to suspended solids and sediment than their neutral counterparts(5).

In addition, based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.0X10-14 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4), volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3). According to a classification scheme(6), BCF values of <2.1 and <0.22, measured in orange-red killifish(2), suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Decreased oxygen levels may be treated with medical oxygen therapy. Treatment with oxygen serves to increase blood oxygen levels and also exerts a secondary effect of decreasing blood flow resistance in the diseased lung, leading to decreased cardiovascular workload in an attempt to oxygenate the lungs. Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure), some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen. Higher level of oxygen than ambient air (hyperoxia) can be introduced under normobaric or hyperbaric conditions.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Oxygen molecules adjust hypoxic ventilatory drive by acting on chemoreceptors on carotid bodies that sequentially relay sensory information to the higher processing centers in brainstem. It also attenuates hypoxia-induced mitochondrial depolarization that generates reactive oxygen species and/or apoptosis. Studies investigating on hyperbaric oxygen therapy has shown that oxygen supplementation can induce neural stem cell proliferation in neonatal rats thus promoting neurological regeneration after injuries.  CD34+, CD45-dim leukocytes are also potential targets for hyperbaric oxygen therapy benefit as their mobilization was increased in vitro which could facilitate the acceleration of recovery at peripheral sites.",

Irrespective of cause, an inadequate supply of oxygen ultimately results in the cessation of aerobic metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, depletion of high-energy cmpd, cellular dysfunction, and death.",

The protective enzymes include superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GP). Glutathione reductase (GR) participates by re-forming glutathione, which is preferentially oxidized, thereby sparing sulfhydryl-bearing proteins and cell wall constituents. Other contributors to the control of oxidant toxicity include vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), vitamin A, and selenium, a cofactor for GP.",

This process achieves successful aerobic respiration in organisms to generate ATP molecules as an energy source in many tissues. Oxygen supplementation acts to restore normal cellular activity at the mitochondrial level and reduce metabolic acidosis. There is also evidence that oxygen may interact with O2-sensitive voltage-gated potassium channels in glomus cells and cause hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane.",

A possible role for toxic oxygen metabolites was evaluated, employing a set-up of blood-perfused isolated rat lungs. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction reflected as pulmonary arterial pressor responses, was evoked by alternately challenging the airways with a hypoxic- and a normoxic gas mixture, resulting in gradually increasing responses until a maximum was obtained. In a sequence of responses (mean +/- s.e. mean) increasing from 2.5 +/ - 0.2 kPa to 3.2 +/ - 0.1 kPa, administration to the perfusate of the inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, allopurinol reduced the subsequent response to 2.5 +/- 0.2 kPa (P < 0.001). By contrast, allopurinol did not affect vasoconstriction induced by serotonin or bradykinin. In control experiments responses continued to increase after administration of hypoxanthine (substrate of xanthine oxidase). Neither pretreatment with daily injections of the antioxidant vitamin E for 3 days in advance, nor addition to the perfusate of the scavenger enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase, or dimethylsulfoxide had any impact on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction; the subsequent responses rose at the same rate and in the same way as before. Thus, the present study has shown that allopurinol inhibition of xanthine oxidase depresses hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This could be due either to reduced production of toxic oxygen metabolites or to accumulation of purine metabolites. The absence of inhibitory effects of quenchers of toxic oxygen metabolites refutes a role for these metabolites in the elicitation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. More likely, allopurinol inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction by interfering with the purine metabolism.",

This suggests that type II cells are resistant to hyperoxia. Oxygen-induced lung injury may result from an overproduction of oxygen metabolites normally scavenged by antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and reduced glutathione. Therefore, resistance of type II cells to hyperoxia may be linked to high antioxidant activities. To test this hypothesis /the authors/ compared in vitro the effects of a 24 hr exposure period to 95% O2 on cultured type II cells, lung fibroblasts and alveolar macrophages isolated from rats. We show that type II cells, when compared with other cell types, are highly sensitive to hyperoxia as shown by increased lactate dehydrogenase release, decreased deoxyribose nucleic acid and protein content of Petri dishes and decreased thymidine incorporation into DNA. Synthesis of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine was also significantly reduced. Antioxidant enzyme activities as well as glutathione content were not higher in type II cells than in other cell types. However, hyperoxia results in a decreased superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione content in type II cells which was not observed in fibroblasts. /It was concluded/ that adaptative changes in superoxide dismutase and glutathione metabolism could be important defense mechanisms in cells exposed to hyperoxia.",

If O2 is given at high enough concentrations for long enough times, the body's protective mechanisms are overwhelmed, leading to cellular injury and, with continued exposure, even death. In the course of O2 metabolism, several toxic substances are generated, including superoxide anion (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH-), lipid peroxides, and others. Without the availability of several enzymes that destroy these toxic intermediary compounds, cell death quickly occurs. The protective enzymes include superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GP). Glutathione reductase (GR) participates by re-forming glutathione, which is preferentially oxidized, thereby sparing sulfhydryl-bearing proteins and cell wall constituents. Other contributors to the control of oxidant toxicity include vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), vitamin A, and selenium, a cofactor for GP. Normally, a balance exists between the production of toxic oxidants and their destruction by antioxidant mechanisms. Some individuals may lack the ability to produce sufficient antioxidants and suffer a slow progressive tissue deterioration as a result.",

Type II cells are less susceptible to toxic injury, can proliferate rapidly, and can be transformed into type I cells. Toxic injuries that affect only type I cells can be repaired by this proliferative process. To the extent that type II cells are also injured, the effects are more severe and may lead to permanent changes. Other types of cells in the lung are also affected, especially the capillary endothelial cells, leading to leakage of blood plasma into the interstitial tissue between the alveoli, and ultimately into the alveoli. Blood cells in the capillaries may also form a clot or may leak into alveolar spaces (hemorrhage). Other cells in the interstitium, such as fibroblasts, are damaged. An inflammatory response, with infiltration of white blood cells, proliferation of fibroblasts, and subsequent fibrosis may follow."

The bed is then blown down to a lower pressure to desorb nitrogen. A purge step may sometimes be used to sweep nitrogen out of the bed before a new cycle begins.",

Other gases in air also dissolve into the membrane and diffuse along with oxygen; the most important of these is nitrogen. ... Selectivity of a membrane material for oxygen becomes an important design parameter. The preferred membrane material must have both a high permeability and a high selectivity for oxygen.",

For small spills, or after leak or flow of liq oxygen has been stopped, use enough water to put out fire quickly. When fire involves liq oxygen and liq fuels, control it as follows: (a) When liq oxygen leaks or flows into large quantities of fuel, shut off flow of liq oxygen, and put remaining fuel fire out with extinguishing agents suitable for use on class B fires. When fuel leaks or flows into large quantities of liq oxygen, shut off flow of fuel. (b) When fuel and liq oxygen are mixed or mixing but are not yet burning, isolate area from sources of ignition and get out quickly, allowing oxygen to evaporate. When large pools of water-soluble fuel are present, use water to dilute fuel and reduce intensity of fire. This method cannot be used with fuels which do not mix with water. Appropriate extinguishing agents may be used to put out fuel fires after the oxygen has evaporated.",

This can deform the gasket, increasing the likelihood that oxygen will leak around the seal and ignite.  The following general safety precautions should also be taken to avoid explosions, tank ruptures and fires from oxygen regulators.  Always \"crack\" cylinder valves (open the valve just enough to allow gas to escape for a very short time) before attaching regulators in order to expel foreign matter from the outlet port of the valve. Always follow the regulator manufacturer's instructions for attaching the regulator to an oxygen cylinder. Always use the sealing gasket specified by the regulator manufacturer. Always inspect the regulator and CGA 870 seal before attaching it to the valve to ensure that the regulator is equipped with only one clean, sealing- type washer (reusable metal-bound rubber seal) or a new crush-type gasket (single use, not reusable, typically Nylon) that is in good condition. Always be certain the valve, regulator and gasket are free from oil or grease. Oil or grease contamination is widely known to contribute to ignition in oxygen systems.  Tighten the T-handle firmly by hand, but do not use wrenches or other hand tools that may over-torque the handle. Open the post valve slowly. If gas escapes at the juncture of the regulator and valve, quickly close the valve. Verify the regulator is properly attached and the gasket is properly placed and in good condition. If you have any questions or concerns contact your supplier.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The explosion ruptured the 2-L reaction flask and seriously injured a researcher.  This reaction has been routinely used in our and many other laboratories to prepare 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne-1,3 on a large scale (>100 g), and no dangerous or unusual behavior was previously noted.  The procedure involves purging oxygen through a solution of TMSA in acetone in the presence of a copper(I) chloride:tetramethylethylenediamine complex catalyst at room temperature as described by Andrew B. Holmes et al. (Org. Syntheses 1993, Coll. Vol. 8, 63). The authors of the procedure recommend a safety shield as a general precaution while working with flammable materials in the atmosphere of oxygen, although no hazard was ever encountered. In this incident, the explosion occurred as soon as we started adding the solution of catalyst in acetone to the reaction. We have consulted with the pioneer of this reaction (Allan S. Hay) and the submitting author of the procedure (Holmes) and considered various scenarios to explain the explosion. Ignition of acetone/TMSA vapor by the external sources was hardly possible as the flask was well sealed and the outgoing gases were passed through a dry-ice condenser (lowering the vapor pressure below the explosive concentration) and brought to the back side of the fume hood through a 1-meter hose.  The reaction temperature (5 \u00baC) was noted by the researcher a few seconds before the explosion, thus ruling out unexpected reaction exothermy. The autoignition of the vapor on a hot stirring adapter (possibly heated by rotation-induced friction) was refuted, because joint lubrication was checked before setting up the experiment, and it would have required achieving an unrealistic temperature of greater than 300 \u00baC. Also, the explosion occurred upon adding the first few drops of copper catalyst, which makes crystallization of the explosive intermediate\u2014copper bis(trimethylsilylacetylide)\u2014highly improbable.  We speculate that a discharge of static electricity between the syringe needle and the digital thermometer inside the flask is the most likely cause of this explosion. A digital thermometer connected to a stirring hot plate (IKA) was used in the reaction, and a plastic syringe with a long metal needle was introduced through the same neck. An induced static voltage on the syringe through friction from handling (often observed in Montreal winter indoors while walking or even simply sitting) could then cause a sufficient differential potential on the needle for a discharge spark to occur close to the metallic body of the digital thermometer. The oxygen-rich atmosphere lowers the ignition energy and makes even a weak spark sufficient to cause a fire.  The incident emphasizes once more the potential danger of mixing oxygen gas with flammable solvents or reagents. More important, introducing two conductors into a flask brings a risk of static electricity discharge between the conductors, which is dangerous whenever a flammable solvent is used without inert gas. As wired metal-gauge digital thermometers are used more often in synthetic practice, precautions must be taken to avoid their contact with other metallic (conducting) parts inside the reaction flasks.\" (reprint of the full-text)",

Heat of water will vigorously vaporize liquid oxygen, pressures may build to dangerous levels if this occurs in a closed container. Liquid oxygen gives a detonable mixture when combined with powdered aluminum [NFPA 491M. 1991]. Contact of very cold liquefied gas with water may result in vigorous or violent boiling of the product and extremely rapid vaporization due to the large temperature differences involved. If the water is hot, there is the possibility that a liquid \"superheat\" explosion may occur. Pressures may build to dangerous levels if liquid gas contacts water in a closed container [Handling Chemicals Safely 1980].",

Some of the incidents occurred during emergency medical use or during routine equipment checks. FDA and NIOSH believe that improper use of gaskets/washers in these regulators was a major factor in both the ignition and severity of the fires, although there are likely other contributing factors.  Two types of washers, referred to as CGA 870 seals, are commonly used to create the seal at the cylinder valve / regulator interface: The type recommended by many regulator manufacturers is a metal-bound elastomeric sealing washer that is designed for multiple use applications. The other common type, often supplied free-of-charge with refilled oxygen cylinders, is a plastic (usually Nylon) crush gasket suitable for single use applications.  When used more than once, the Nylon  crush gaskets require higher torque than the elastomeric sealing washers in order to seal the cylinder valve / regulator interface, and if they are used again, they require more torque with each successive use. The cylinder valve / regulator connection is designed to be hand-tightened. If the crush gaskets are re-used, the need for increased torque may require using a wrench or other hand tool, which can deform the crush gasket and damage the cylinder valve and regulator. This can result in leakage of oxygen past the cylinder valve seat and across the nylon crush gasket. According to a forensic analysis supported by FDA and NIOSH, \"flow friction\" caused by this leakage of compressed oxygen across the surface of the crush gasket may produce enough thermal energy to spontaneously ignite the nylon gasket material. ...",

The shipfitter had been asked to drill and cut up acetylene cylinders that were marked with an \"X\" in a circle. The oxygen cylinder had the same marking. The company had no written procedures on the destruction and salvage of compressed gas cylinders. The CA/FACE investigator concluded that, in order to prevent similar future occurrences, employers should:   Assure each gas cylinder marked for destruction is labeled or marked to differentiate them from those not ready for destruction.  Use an unmistakable marking on cylinders that have been prepared for salvage or destruction.  Prepare an appropriate written program describing the procedures for the destruction and salvaging of compressed gas cylinders.  Use an appropriate method for the destruction of pressurized compressed gas cylinders.",

Carefully maintained, anesthetized, intubated, and mechanically ventilated baboons /were exposed/ for 11 days to 40% O2, 80% O2, 100% O2 ... or 80% O2 followed by inoculation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. The groups exposed to 100% O2 or 80% O2 plus bacterial inoculation showed mixed exudative-reparative diffuse alveolar lesions, altered morphology of type II cells, increased numbers of type II cells and interstitial cells, and decreased numbers of type I and endothelial cells. The animals exposed to 40% O2 or 80% O2 showed increased numbers of alveolar macrophages and focal widening of alveolar walls. The most striking finding was that 80% O2 plus infection caused responses as severe as 100% O2. It was suggested that the combination with infection reflects the evolution of adult respiratory distress syndrome that occurs in some human patients in intensive medical care units (and other situations involving lung injury)."

Rates of development of effects of pulmonary oxygen toxicity were monitored during oxygen exposure at 2.5, 2.0, and 1.5 atmospheres absolute with repeated flow-volume loops, spirometry, and symptom assessment. Additional pulmonary measurements before and after exposure included lung compliance, airway resistance, density dependence of flow, nitrogen closing volumes, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and alveolar-arterial oxygen differences. Of these measurements only airway resistance and closing volumes were not significantly affected at any pressure, but patterns and magnitudes of effects varied at different pressures. Overall, the data indicate that continuous oxygen exposure at 3.0 to 1.5 atmospheres absolute affects pulmonary mechanical function earlier and more prominently than carbon monoxide diffusing capacity. Recovery of lung mechanical function usually occurred within 12-24 hr after exposure, but required more than 24 hr in some individuals. No individual measure of pulmonary function was found to be uniquely satisfactory for monitoring rates of development or reversal of pulmonary oxygen poisoning. The existence of multiple pulmonary effects of oxygen toxicity and the complexity of their interactions require selective applications of individual toxicity indices to specific conditions of exposure and recovery.",

Direct visual observations /were made/ of the interior of the trachea and ... rate of mucus transport /measured/ in 10 human volunteers who breathed oxygen through a face mask for 6 hr. The oxygen concn was 90 to 95%. Observations were made after 3 and 6 hr. Tracheal mucous velocity was decreased after 3 hr and all subjects showed visual evidence of tracheal irritation after 6 hr. ... Three subjects had fever and two had symptoms of acute bronchitis several hours after the study was completed; one had sinusitis and conjunctivitis. These phenomena might be related to the procedure of passing a fiberoptic bronchoscope into the trachea. Two others became nauseated and vomited during the evening of the study. All were extremely fatigued. None complained of substernal pain or other symptoms of tracheal or bronchial irritation during the oxygen exposure.",

Hyperoxia caused a significant alveolar-capillary \"leak\" as detected by the presence of increased plasma albumin and transferrin in lavage fluid. Although some of the effects of exposure to 17 hr of more than 95% oxygen are reversible, hyperoxia for even this short period lowers the structural or functional barriers that normally prevent alveolar-capillary \"leak\" and induces processes that can culminate in fibrosis of the alveolar wall.",

Pups were then euthanized and 100 uL of blood was collected (cardiac puncture) for differential white blood cells analysis (n=12 per group). The lungs, a piece of distal ileum, and the left kidney were removed for histologic evaluation. Both NH and weaning /(return to air breathing)/ generated significant increases in blood neutrophil count, whereas lymphocyte population was significantly increased only after weaning (P<0.05; analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). Normobaric hyperoxia created mild increases in the renal tubular necrosis, dilation, regeneration, and interstitial inflammation.

Sixty-five hr of oxygen exposure in newborn rabbits produced no evidence of lung injury on light microscopy, 97% of bronchoalveolar lavage white cells were alveolar macrophages and bronchoalveolar lavage protein was low. No differences were found in the percentage of alveolar macrophages, and the proportion of PMN was low in both hyperoxic (n=9) and normoxic (n=7) newborn groups. Mortality was comparable, 14% and 11% in normoxic and hyperoxic newborn groups, respectively. An equal period of oxygen exposure produced significant lung injury in adult rabbits, and a mortality of 27% (not significant). Adults appeared dyspneic and frequently had grossly visible subpleural hemorrhages. Microscopic analysis revealed an intense inflammatory cell infiltrate, an exudate in the air spaces and areas of intra-alveolar hemorrhage. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from oxygen injured adults contained a 17-fold greater percentage of PMN and 16-fold higher protein than oxygen exposed newborns. Newborns under normoxic conditions had very high levels of 6-keto-PGF1a and low quantities of TXB2. Hyperoxic newborns had lower 6-keto-PGF1a and significantly higher TXB2. Hyperoxic adults had significantly lower 6-keto-PGF1a, and significantly higher LTB4 and LTC4 in bronchoalveolar lavage compared to hyperoxic newborns. Leukotriene D4 values, although 25% higher on average in the adult rabbits, were not statistically different.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

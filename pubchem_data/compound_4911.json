For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It inhibits the reabsorption of urate at the proximal convoluted tubule, thus increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing serum urate levels. Effective uricosuria reduces the miscible urate pool, retards urate deposition, and promotes resorption of urate deposits. At the proximal and distal tubles, probenecid competitively inhibits the secretion of many weak organic acids including penicillins, most cephalosporins, and some other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. This results in an increase in the plasma concentrations of acidic drugs eliminated principally by renal secretion, but only a slight increase if the drug is eliminated mainly by filtration. Thus, the drug can be used for therapeutic advantages to increase concentrations of certain \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of gonorrhea, neurosyphilis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The drug competitively inhibits active reabsorption of uric acid at the proximal convoluted tubule, thus promoting urinary excretion of uric acid and reducing serum urate concentrations.  Probenecid may reduce plasma protein binding of urate and, in subtherapeutic doses, may inhibit renal secretion of uric acid. In healthy individuals, probenecid has no effect on the glomerular filtration rate or on the tubular reabsorption of normal urinary constituents such as glucose, arginine, urea, sodium, potassium, chloride, or phosphate.",

In general, the net effect of probenecid on the plasma concentration of weak acids depends on the ratio of the amount of organic acid secreted by the kidneys to that amount filtered at the glomeruli. Thus, probenecid substantially increases plasma concentrations of acidic drugs eliminated principally by renal secretion, but increases plasma concentrations only slightly if the drug is eliminated mainly by filtration. Plasma concentrations of penicillins are often more than doubled by probenecid; the concentration of penicillin in the CSF is also increased. Probenecid also substantially increases plasma concentrations of most cephalosporins and some other beta-lactam antibiotics. In addition, half-lives of the penicillins and cephalosporins are prolonged and their volumes of distribution may be reduced by probenecid. ... The cellular mechanism(s) responsible for the inhibition of renal tubular transport by probenecid is not known. The drug may inhibit transport enzymes that require a source of high energy phosphate bonds and/or nonspecifically interfere with substrate access to protein receptor sites on the kidney tubules.",

Exposure may precipitate an acute attack of gout, and renal colic or renal calculi with or without hematuria may occur. It may also cause gastrointestinal upset. Other symptoms include urticaria, nephrosis, coma and status epilepticus. In massive overdosage, stimulation of the central nervous system with convulsions and death from respiratory failure may occur. Exposure may also cause increased plasma concentrations of methotrexate, costovertebral pain, precipitation of acute gouty arthritis, anorexia, leukopenia, alopecia and hemolytic anemia (which could be related to genetic deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in red blood cells). It may also cause skin rashes. It may occasionally cause drug fever. Jaundice, asthma and eosinophilia have preceded a massive hepatic necrosis.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

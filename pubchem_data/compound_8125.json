When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks in direct contact with flames. For massive fire, use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2024)",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It may also be released to the environment from its presence in gasoline. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 17.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-octene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-octene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.9 hrs. If released to soil, 1-octene is expected to have low to moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 510. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.627 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Octene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Based on pure culture studies, 1-octene has the potential to biodegrade under aerobic conditions in soil and water. If released into water, 1-octene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.1 hrs and 4.2 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 660 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 1-octene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-octene is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 1-octene by inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food containing 1-octene, or dermal contact due to its presence in gasoline. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.1 hours and 4.2 days, respectively(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond 2 m deep is estimated to be 37 hrs ignoring adsorption; when considering maximum adsorption, the volatilization half-life increases to 95 hrs(6).

Vapor-phase 1-octene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.9 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3) determined using a structure estimation method(3). Vapor-phase 1-octene is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone molecules(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 23 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.2X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3) determined using a structure estimation method(3).",

The reaction in the present of sunlight, NO, and alkenes or aldehydes, produced carbonyls, alkyl nitrates and peroxyacyl nitrates. The carbonyl products of the gas-phase reaction of OH radicals with 1-octene were (product, yield): heptanal, 0.21; formaldehyde, 0.39(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.3X10-14 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexanitrodiphenylamine will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase 2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexanitrodiphenylamine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2,2',4,4',6,6'-Hexanitrodiphenylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexanitrodiphenylamine is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.1X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-17 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, 2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexanitrodiphenylamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 76 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexanitrodiphenylamine may have occurred through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexanitrodiphenylamine was produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may have been exposed to 2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexanitrodiphenylamine via ingestion of drinking water. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since 2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexanitrodiphenylamine is no longer produced or used in the US. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

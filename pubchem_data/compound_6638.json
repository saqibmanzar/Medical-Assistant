The IR spectra tells you what types of vibrational mode (motion) responses occur in a molecule interacting with infrared light.  It is used to help determine the functional groups in a molecule.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

An inhibitor or cytochrome p450, 1-phenylimidazole, administered at concentrations of 2.5, 4 and 10 mmol, was not mutagenic in Drosophila. Methyl-p-toluenesulfonate applied orally was a weak mutagen. When administered simultaneously with 1-phenylimidazole, a concentration dependent increase was noted in mutagenic activity of methyl-p-toluenesulfonate. Following injection, mutagenesis by methyl-p-toluenesulfonate was considerable. Ethyl-p-toluenesulfonate demonstrated marginal mutagenesis in Drosophila when orally applied but was decidedly mutagenic on injection. Simultaneous treatment with 4 mmol 1-phenylimidazole and 1 mmole of ethyl-p-toluenesulfonate did not alter mutagenesis nor did treatment with diethylmaleate (glutathione depletion). Combined treatment with 2 mmol ethyl-p-toluenesulfonate and 2 mmol 1-phenylimidazole produced a statistically significant increase in mutagenesis. /It was concluded/ that weak mutagenesis by p-toluenesulfonates after feeding experiments compared to considerable effects after injection suggests metabolic deactivation in the gut.",

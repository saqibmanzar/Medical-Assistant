PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

Procaine benzylpenicillin is administered by deep intramuscular injection. It is slowly absorbed and hydrolyzed to benzylpenicillin. This drug is used where prolonged exposure to benzylpenicillin at a low concentration is required. This combination is aimed at reducing the pain and discomfort associated with a large intramuscular injection of penicillin. It is widely used in veterinary settings. Benzylpenicillin is active against a wide range of organisms and is the drug of first choice for many infections.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Among the adverse reactions which had been reported in people consuming food containing benzylpenicillin residues, hypersensitivity reactions were the most common. The overall prevalence of allergy to penicillin was estimated to be 3 - 10%. There was no evidence of sensitization caused by benzylpenicillin residues in food. The Committee evaluated the available data on allergic reactions caused by penicillin residues. Only four cases were considered to be adequately documented to demonstrate that hypersensitivity reactions could be caused by ingestion of less than 40 \u00b5g of the drug. The Committee concluded that allergy was the determinating factor in the safety evaluation of residues of benzylpenicillin. In the absence of adequate data to establish a no-effect level, the Committee recommended that the daily intake from food be kept as low as practicable, and in any case below 30 \u00b5g of the parent drug. The risk associated with the occurrence of mild hypersensitivity reactions at this level was considered to be insignificant.",

Among the adverse reactions which had been reported in people consuming food containing benzylpenicillin residues, hypersensitivity reactions were the most common. The overall prevalence of allergy to penicillin was estimated to be 3 - 10%. There was no evidence of sensitization caused by benzylpenicillin residues in food. The Committee evaluated the available data on allergic reactions caused by penicillin residues. Only four cases were considered to be adequately documented to demonstrate that hypersensitivity reactions could be caused by ingestion of less than 40 \u00b5g of the drug. The Committee concluded that allergy was the determinating factor in the safety evaluation of residues of benzylpenicillin. In the absence of adequate data to establish a no-effect level, the Committee recommended that the daily intake from food be kept as low as practicable, and in any case below 30 \u00b5g of the parent drug. The risk associated with the occurrence of mild hypersensitivity reactions at this level was considered to be insignificant.",

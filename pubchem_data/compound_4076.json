Mescaline was rapidly taken up by all the organs examined. In general, the organs of younger rats accumulated much larger amounts than those of adult animals. Brain concentrated the lowest amounts in comparison with other tissues. In the brain, the uptake was the highest in 1-day-old rats and decreased with age. The disappearance of mescaline in various organs was comparatively slower in younger animals than in 20-day or older rats. Rats immediately after birth and uptake was the highest in 1-day-old rats and decreased with age. The disappearance of mescaline in various organs was comparatively slower in younger animals than in 20-day or older rats. Rats immediately after birth and up to 20 days of age metabolized mescaline less efficiently than adults. From the data, it appears that the blood-brain barrier for mescaline develops gradually with age but is not completely impermeable in adults.",

Mescaline-oxidizing activity (micromoles/ per milligram of protein/15 min) of lung homogenates was 4 times greater than that of either liver or kidney.

Removal of mescaline from the medium perfusing the isolated rabbit lung was explained by intrapulmonary metabolism. Semicarbazide (10(-3) M pargyline. Semicarbazide-treated lungs accumulated more mescaline than did untreated lungs. Mescaline efflux from lung was slower than that of its metabolite.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

All known drugs of this class are 5-HT(2A) receptor (2AR) agonists, yet closely related 2AR agonists such as lisuride lack comparable psychoactive properties. Why only certain 2AR agonists are hallucinogens and which neural circuits mediate their effects are poorly understood. By genetically expressing 2AR only in cortex, we show that 2AR-regulated pathways on cortical neurons are sufficient to mediate the signaling pattern and behavioral response to hallucinogens. Hallucinogenic and nonhallucinogenic 2AR agonists both regulate signaling in the same 2AR-expressing cortical neurons. However, the signaling and behavioral responses to the hallucinogens are distinct. While lisuride and LSD both act at 2AR expressed by cortex neurons to regulate phospholipase C, LSD responses also involve pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G(i/o) proteins and Src. These studies identify the long-elusive neural and signaling mechanisms responsible for the unique effects of hallucinogens.",

The effects of MES and its analogs were examined with respect to muscle twitch, resting membrane potential and nicotinic receptor binding. Mescaline and its analogs (10-100 microM) blocked both directly and neurally evoked twitches but their effects on neurally evoked twitches were greater than those on directly evoked twitches. Mescaline, ANH and MMT decreased amplitude of the miniature endplate and endplate potentials, decreased acetylcholine (ACh) quantal content, hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential and prolonged duration of the action potential. They did not significantly displace the binding of [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX) to nicotinic receptors, at concentrations which blocked neuromuscular transmission.

It includes the likely routes of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, skin and eye contact), and the delayed, immediate, or chronic effects/symptoms from short- and long-term exposure, and the numerical measures of toxicity [e.g., acute toxicity estimates such as the LD50 (median lethal dose, the estimated amount of a chemical expected to kill 50% of test animals in a single dose)].  This section also includes information on whether the chemical is considered as a potential carcinogen according to authoritative sources such as the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens and the International agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs.",

Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

Excitement, agitation, slight increase in ventilation and occasional head-shaking were seen 30 min after mescaline and continued for 30-45 min thereafter; locomotor activity and the number of scratching events were significantly increased during this period. chlorpromazine (2.5, 5, 15 mg/kg) and thioridazine (10, 30, 45 mg/kg) partially or completely blocked mescaline-induced gross behavior; chlorpromazine-sulfoxide (15 mg/kg) was not effective. Increased scratching responses and locomotor activity induced by mescaline were antagonized by all doses of chlorpromazine and thioridazine; at higher doses, both chlorpromazine (7.5, 15 mg/kg) and thioridazine (45 mg/kg) induced cataleptic-like condition and marked hypothermia.

Mescaline produced an acute psychotic state 3 1/2-4 hr after drug intake, as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Paranoid Depression Scale (PDS). The Assessment of Altered States of Consciousness (APZ) questionnaire revealed specific effects of mescaline in the visual system. Neuropsychological effects were studied with a face/nonface decision task with known right-hemisphere advantage, in which mescaline induced a decrease of functioning of the right hemisphere. In functional brain imaging using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), mescaline produced a \"hyperfrontal\" pattern with an emphasis on the right hemisphere, which was correlated with mescaline-induced psychotic psychopathology. These findings question the validity of the concept of hypofrontality as an explanation for schizophrenic symptomatology. The study of psychoactive substances under controlled laboratory conditions has the methodological advantage of intraindividual control, and hence, minimal variability of data.",

Headaches, dizziness, ataxia, tremors, weakness, hallucinations, and paresthesias have been noted.

Mescaline, in moderate to large doses, can induce biphasic--depressant followed by stimulant--effects on learned and other performance of laboratory rodents. Motor impairment, using three doses, was accordingly measured during the depressant phase by two methods. An 'ataxia' test, involving analyses of footprints, showed few irregularities of gait splay due to mescaline, but the drug markedly reduced the length of steps ('stride') in a dose-related manner. In a 'tilt plane' test for general motor control, the animals' ability to cling to a tilted plane decreased with 25 mg/kg mescaline, at 30 and 40 minutes after administration. Deficits of this kind can be relevant to interpreting drug actions on forms of behavior which involve movements for responding, and they also have interesting potential in their own right.",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The aim of the present work was to investigate whether the class of monovalent ionophores, which includes drugs used in veterinary medicine and that were recently proposed as human anticancer agents, meets these requirements. The activity of salinomycin, monensin, and nigericin on Plasmodium falciparum asexual and sexual erythrocytic stages and on the development of the Plasmodium berghei and P. falciparum mosquito stages is reported here. Gametocytogenesis of the P. falciparum strain 3D7 was induced in vitro, and gametocytes at stage II and III or stage IV and V of development were treated for different lengths of time with the ionophores and their viability measured with the parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) assay. The monovalent ionophores efficiently killed both asexual parasites and gametocytes with a nanomolar 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). Salinomycin showed a fast speed of kill compared to that of standard drugs, and the potency was higher on stage IV and V than on stage II and III gametocytes. The ionophores inhibited ookinete development and subsequent oocyst formation in the mosquito midgut, confirming their transmission-blocking activity. Potential toxicity due to hemolysis was excluded, since only infected and not normal erythrocytes were damaged by ionophores. Our data strongly support the downstream exploration of monovalent ionophores for repositioning as new antimalarial and transmission-blocking leads.",

The aim of this study was to test a strategy designed to deliver salinomycin to glioblastoma cells in vitro. Salinomycin-encapsulated polysorbate 80-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (P80-SAL-PLGA) were prepared and characterized with respect to particle size, morphology, thermal properties, drug encapsulation efficiency and controlled salinomycin-release behaviour. The in vitro cellular uptake of P80-SAL-PLGA (5 and 10 uM) or uncoated nanoparticles was assessed in T98G human glioblastoma cells, and the cell viability was investigated with respect to anti-growth activities. SAL, which was successfully transported to T98G glioblastoma cells via P80 coated nanoparticles (~14% within 60 min), greatly decreased (p < 0.01) the cellular viability of T98G cells. Substantial morphological changes were observed in the T98G cells with damaged actin cytoskeleton. Thus, P80-SAL-PLGA nanoparticles induced cell death, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for this salinomycin delivery system in the treatment of human glioblastoma.",

The drug was given by intracrop and intravenous routes in a single dose of 20 mg kg-1 body-weight. The highest serum concentrations of salinomycin were reached half an hour after oral dosage with an absorption half-life (t0.5(ab)) of 3.64 hours and elimination half-life (t0.5(beta)) of 1.96 hours. The systemic bioavailability percentage was 73.02 per cent after intracrop administration, indicating the high extent of salinomycin absorption from this route in chickens. Following intravenous injection the kinetics of salinomycin can be described by a two-compartment open model with a t1/2(alpha) of 0.48 hours, Vd ss (volume of distribution) of 3.28 litre kg-1 and Cl(beta) (total body clearance) of 27.39 ml kg-1 min-1. The serum protein-binding tendency of salinomycin as calculated in vitro was 19.78 per cent. Salinomycin concentrations in the serum and tissues of birds administered salinomycin premix (60 ppm) for two weeks were lower than those after administration of a single intracrop dose of pure salinomycin (20 mg kg-1 bodyweight). The highest concentration of salinomycin residues were present in the liver followed by the kidneys, muscles, fat, heart and skin. No salinomycin residues were detected in tissues after 48 hours except in the liver and these had disappeared completely by 72 hours.",

Salinomycin (SAL), a broad spectrum antibiotic and a coccidiostat has been found to counter tumour resistance and kill cancer stem cells with better efficacy than the existing chemotherapeutic agents; paclitaxel and doxorubicin. This refocused its importance for treatment of human cancers. In this study, we studied the in vitro drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic parameters of SAL. SAL undergoes rapid metabolism in liver microsomes and has a high intrinsic clearance. SAL metabolism is mainly mediated by CYP enzymes; CYP3A4 the major enzyme metabolising SAL. The percent plasma protein binding of SAL in human was significantly lower as compared to mouse and rat plasma. CYP inhibition was carried out by chemical inhibition and recombinant enzyme studies. SAL was found to be a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 as well as CYP3A4. As CYP3A4 was the major enzyme responsible for metabolism of SAL, in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats was done to check the effect of concomitant administration of Ketoconazole (KTC) on SAL pharmacokinetics. KTC, being a selective CYP3A4 inhibitor increased the systemic exposure of SAL significantly to 7-fold in AUC0-a and 3-fold increase in Cmax of SAL in rats with concomitant KTC administration.",

In the present study, we sought to investigate the mechanisms responsible for salinomycin's selective targeting of BCSCs and its anti-tumor activity. Salinomycin suppressed cell viability, concomitant with the downregulation of cyclin D1 and increased p27(kip1) nuclear accumulation. Mammosphere formation assays revealed that salinomycin suppresses self-renewal of ALDH1-positive BCSCs and downregulates the transcription factors Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2. TUNEL analysis of MDA-MB-231-derived xenografts revealed that salinomycin administration elicited a significant reduction in tumor growth with a marked downregulation of ALDH1 and CD44 levels, but seemingly without the induction of apoptosis. Our findings shed further light on the mechanisms responsible for salinomycin's effects on BCSCs.",

The Wnt/beta-catenin signal transduction pathway plays a central role in stem cell development, and its aberrant activation can cause cancer. In this study, we identified salinomycin as a potent inhibitor of the Wnt signaling cascade. In Wnt-transfected HEK293 cells, salinomycin blocked the phosphorylation of the Wnt coreceptor lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) and induced its degradation. Nigericin, another potassium ionophore with activity against cancer stem cells, exerted similar effects. In otherwise unmanipulated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with constitutive Wnt activation nanomolar concentrations of salinomycin down-regulated the expression of Wnt target genes such as LEF1, cyclin D1, and fibronectin, depressed LRP6 levels, and limited cell survival. Normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes resisted salinomycin toxicity. These results indicate that ionic changes induced by salinomycin and related drugs inhibit proximal Wnt signaling by interfering with LPR6 phosphorylation, and thus impair the survival of cells that depend on Wnt signaling at the plasma membrane.",

The essence of this paper is to demonstrate that one single method can serve very well for two entirely different purposes, i.e., screening & confirmation. Highly reliable confirmation of the identity at low concentrations was demonstrated when residues of narasin were detected & quantified (0.2 to 11 ng g(-1)) in 50% of the Swedish eggs analysed in 1999. Four daughter ions were detected with ion ratios meeting suggested confirmation criteria for the European Union, even at 0.2 ng g(-1). The method was found to be highly cost-effective since both screening & confirmation of 98 liver samples were performed in only two analytical runs (the Swedish national surveillance scheme of 1999, report level 5 ng g(-1)). The high performance of the method for the different applications was possible due to a combination of the power of ES-LC-MS-MS, a procedure involving screening of pooled samples, & method optimisation of the work-up (automated solid phase extraction), LC & MS parameters. Validation data for narasin (0.5 to 20 ng g(-1)) in eggs are presented (accuracy 94 to 108%, relative standard deviation 4 to 10%, limit of detection 0.026 ng g(-1)). The time for an LC-MS-MS run was 4 min, corresponding to 48 s per sample in a pool.",

                                                    "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Salinomycin is a veterinary drug used for the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler, roaster and replacement chickens caused by Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti and E. mivati. It is also used for the prevention of coccidiosis in quail caused by Eimeria dispersa and E. lettyae. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: The cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of salinomycin were investigated in human non-malignant cells. Primary human nasal mucosa cells (monolayer and mini organ cultures) and peripheral blood lymphocytes from 10 individuals were used to study the cytotoxic effects of salinomycin (0.1-175 uM) by annexin-propidiumiodide- and MTT-test. The comet assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Additionally, the secretion of interleukin-8 was analyzed by ELISA. Flow cytometry and MTT assay revealed significant cytotoxic effects in nasal mucosa cells and lymphocytes at low salinomycin concentrations of 10-20 uM. No genotoxic effects could be observed. IL-8 secretion was elevated at 5 uM. Salinomycin-induced cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects were seen at concentrations relevant for anti-cancer treatment. ANIMAL STUDIES: There are numerous reports of fatal outcomes when salinomycin is accidently fed to various animals. A sudden outbreak of mortality in one house of 600 48-week-old male breeder turkeys on a five-house turkey breeder farm was suspected to be feed-related. The turkeys gasped and became recumbent; 21.7% of affected turkeys died. Histological lesions, limited to skeletal muscle, consisted of degeneration and necrosis and were judged compatible with ionophore toxicosis. Feed samples from the affected house were analyzed and shown to contain 13.4 to 18.4 g of salinomycin per ton of feed. To further study the effects of salinomycin on turkeys, five 7-day trials using 336, 24, 24, 40, and 40 male turkeys when 7, 11, 15, 27, and 32 weeks of age, respectively. Salinomycin became more toxic as the age of the turkeys increased. When 7-week-old turkeys were fed diets containing 44 or 66 ppm salinomycin, only 1 of 84 died; when turkeys 27 or 32 weeks of age were fed those amounts, 13 of 20 died. Salinomycin at 22 ppm tended to depress rate of growth at young ages and to prevent or decrease growth and to increase mortality at older ages. Accidental poisonings were also reported in six horses fed salinomycin.  The range of signs, including anorexia, colic, weakness and ataxia bore similarities to those described in horses poisoned with the related ionophore monensin. In another poisoning, horses were fed a concentrate containing 61 mg/kg salinomycin as faulty prepared by the manufacturer. All horses developed severe clinical signs of intoxication. Despite therapy eight horses died within three to six days. Ten others became recumbent and had to be euthanized. Only six horses survived. The dominating laboratory results were very high enzyme levels and alkalosis. The most characteristic clinical change appeared as paralysis of the hindlimbs. An outbreak of toxic polyneuropathy in cats that had ingested dry cat food contaminated with salinomycin has also been reported. Epidemiologic and clinical data were collected from 823 cats, or about 1% of the cats at risk. In 21 affected cats, postmortem examination was performed. The affected cats had acute onset of lameness and paralysis of the hindlimbs followed by the forelimbs. Clinical and pathologic examination indicated a distal polyneuropathy involving both the sensory and motor nerves. The clinical signs and pathology in an outbreak of toxicity in feedlot cattle attributed to the ingestion of toxic levels of salinomycin over an extended period of 11 weeks have also been reported. Thirty-nine out of 380 cattle developed signs consistent with cardiac failure and 8 of these died. Clinical signs included dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and exercise intolerance. Two cattle were necropsied and in one there were macroscopic lesions suggestive of congestive heart failure, namely pulmonary edema, hydrothorax and hepatomegaly. Histopathology revealed a chronic cardiomyopathy characterized principally by extensive myocardial fiber atrophy with multifocal hypertrophy and interstitial and replacement fibrosis. Hepatic and pulmonary lesions were consistent with those of congestive cardiac failure. Finally, 100% mortality was reported in a herd of sheep that were given feed containing salinomycin. The morning after the feeding, 78 sheep were found dead and one of them showed convulsive seizures. Postmortem examination revealed pulmonary congestion and edema, hemorrhages in abomasum, large pale kidney and white streak lines in myocardium.",

Drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of HCC. In the present study, we used salinomycin (Sal) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combination therapy on HCC cell lines Huh7, LM3 and SMMC-7721 and nude mice subcutaneously tumor model to study whether Sal could increase the sensitivity of hepatoma cells to the traditional chemotherapeutic agent such as 5-FU. The combination of Sal and 5-FU resulted in a synergistic antitumor effect against liver tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Sal reversed the 5-FU-induced increase in CD133(+) EPCAM(+) cells, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The combination of Sal and 5-FU may provide us with a new approach to reverse drug resistant for the treatment of patients with HCC.",

Even the first line chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin only yields a response rate of 18-29%. The antibiotic salinomycin, a potassium ionophore, has recently been shown to be a potent compound to deplete chemoresistant cells like cancer stem like cells (CSC) in adenocarcinomas. Here, we evaluated the effect of salinomycin on sarcoma cell lines, whereby salinomycin mono- and combination treatment with doxorubicin regimens were analyzed. To evaluate the effect of salinomycin on fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and liposarcoma cell lines, cells were drug exposed in single and combined treatments, respectively. The effects of the corresponding treatments were monitored by cell viability assays, cell cycle analysis, caspase 3/7 and 9 activity assays. Further we analyzed NF-kappaB activity; p53, p21 and PUMA transcription levels, together with p53 expression and serine 15 phosphorylation. The combination of salinomycin with doxorubicin enhanced caspase activation and increased the sub-G1 fraction. The combined treatment yielded higher NF-kappaB activity, and p53, p21 and PUMA transcription, whereas the salinomycin monotreatment did not cause any significant changes. Salinomycin increases the chemosensitivity of sarcoma cell lines - even at sub-lethal concentrations - to the cytostatic drug doxorubicin. These findings support a strategy to decrease the doxorubicin concentration in combination with salinomycin in order to reduce toxic side effects.",

The proliferation of Jurkat cells was examined by CKK-8 assay. Flow cytometry was used to assess cellular apoptosis. Levels of BCL-2, caspase-3, and caspase- 8 were measured by Western blot. The salinomycin or vincristine, either alone or in combination, inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner. Salinomycin combined with vincristine produced more obvious inhibition of cell proliferation than either compound used alone (P<0.05). Western blot analysis showed that the combined use of Sal and VCR reduced the expression of BCL-2 protein, and increased expression of caspase 3 and caspase 8 protein, more significantly. Furthermore, combination of Sal and VCR synergistally promoted apoptosis of the Jurkat cells (P<0.05).   The combination of salinomycin and vincristine synergistically inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells.",

However, knowledge about the toxicity of this ionophor substance is incomplete. The aim of this study was to investigate cyto- and genotoxic effects of salinomycin in human non-malignant cells. Primary human nasal mucosa cells (monolayer and mini organ cultures) and peripheral blood lymphocytes from 10 individuals were used to study the cytotoxic effects of salinomycin (0.1-175 uM) by annexin-propidiumiodide- and MTT-test. The comet assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Additionally, the secretion of interleukin-8 was analyzed by ELISA. Flow cytometry and MTT assay revealed significant cytotoxic effects in nasal mucosa cells and lymphocytes at low salinomycin concentrations of 10-20 uM. No genotoxic effects could be observed. IL-8 secretion was elevated at 5 uM. Salinomycin-induced cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects were seen at concentrations relevant for anti-cancer treatment. Concurrent to the evaluation of salinomycin application in experimental oncology, adverse effects in non-malignant cells need to be monitored and reduced as much as possible. ...",

One important caveat for its clinical application is the paucity of preclinical pharmacological and safety data. In the present study, we thus aimed to elucidate pharmacokinetic properties of salinomycin and to assess the side effect profile of chronic treatment with this compound in C57Bl/6 mice. In addition, we tested whether neurotoxic side effects can be prevented by interference with the intracellular calcium homeostasis. We observed that salinomycin has a narrow therapeutic index; however, a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight was well tolerated, and analysis of blood parameters as well as organ histology of liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart showed no abnormalities after daily salinomycin injection for 4 weeks. Pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed low micromolar peak concentrations and an almost complete systemic elimination within 5 h after injection. In contrast to low systemic toxicity, typical signs of a sensory polyneuropathy with mechanical and cold allodynia, distinct gait alterations, decreased sensory nerve action potential amplitudes, and loss of myelinated fibers in the sciatic nerve were observed in salinomycin-treated animals. Inhibition of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger partially prevented the development of salinomycin-induced neuropathy in vivo, an approach which did not reduce salinomycin's antineoplastic efficacy in vitro. Taken together, this study establishes a framework of pharmacokinetic data for future preclinical trials and safety data for translational trials. Furthermore, we established a strategy to reduce salinomycin's off-target neurotoxic effects. Salinomycin has a narrow therapeutic index; a dose of 5 mg/kg is tolerated in mice. Mice treated with salinomycin develop a painful sensory polyneuropathy. An optimized protocol was established to measure salinomycin in serum samples. Inhibition of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers prevents salinomycin-induced neuropathy. Blocking mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers does not impair antineoplastic efficacy.",

Salinomycin became more toxic as the age of the turkeys increased. When 7-week-old turkeys were fed diets containing 44 or 66 ppm salinomycin, only 1 of 84 died; when turkeys 27 or 32 weeks of age were fed those amounts, 13 of 20 died. Salinomycin at 22 ppm tended to depress rate of growth at young ages and to prevent or decrease growth and to increase mortality at older ages.

Its implication in cancer therapy has recently been proposed. Present study evaluated the toxic effects of Salinomycin on male reproductive system of mice. Doses of 1, 3 or 5 mg/kg of Salinomycin were administered daily for 28 days. Half of the mice were sacrificed after 24 h of the last treatment and other half were sacrificed 28 days after withdrawal of treatment. Effects of SAL on body and reproductive organ weights were studied. Histoarchitecture of testis and epididymis was evaluated along with ultrastructural changes in Leydig cells. Serum and testicular testosterone and luteinizing hormones were estimated. Superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation, catalase and lactate dehydrogenase activities were measured. Spermatozoa count, morphology, motility and fertility were evaluated. Expression patterns of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage proteins (CYP11A1) were assessed by Western blotting. Salinomycin treatment was lethal to few mice and retarded body growth in others with decreased weight of testes and seminal vesicles in a dose dependent manner. Seminiferous tubules in testes were disrupted and the epithelium of epididymis showed frequent occurrence of vacuolization and necrosis. Leydig cells showed hypertrophied cytoplasm with shrunken nuclei, condensed mitochondria, proliferated endoplasmic reticulum and increased number of lipid droplets. Salinomycin decreased motility and spermatozoa count with increased number of abnormal spermatozoa leading to infertility. The testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels were decreased in testis but increased in serum at higher doses. Depletion of superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione with increased lipid peroxidation in both testis and epididymis indicated generation of oxidative stress. Suppressed expression of StAR and CYP11A1 proteins indicates inhibition of steroidogenesis. Spermatogenesis was however observed in testis 28 days after Salinomycin withdrawal. The results indicate reversible dose-dependent adverse effects of Salinomycin on male reproductive system of mice.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.4X10-23 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates salinomycin will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase salinomycin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Salinomycin did not absorb light at environmentally relevant wavelengths and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, salinomycin is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 6050. The estimated pKa of salinomycin is 4.5, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Salinomycin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Salinomycin was degraded 50-70% in soil in 7 day aerobic studies, 20-25% was attributed to abiotic reactions and the remaining portion was considered biodegradation. Other degradation studies indicated half-lives of 5 days aerobically and 6 days anaerobically. If released into water, salinomycin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's pKa. An estimated BCF of 10 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Salinomycin was stable to hydrolysis at pH >7, but had hydrolysis half-lives of 1.3, 4.2 and 40.8 hours at pH 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Occupational exposure to salinomycin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where salinomycin is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to salinomycin via ingestion of eggs that may contain salinomycin. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The possibility that this action depended on an effect of nitrilotriacetic acid on chromium(VI) reduction by cellular proteins was demonstrated. Gene mutations were detected by the Ames plate incorporation test on strains (TA-100), (TA-92), (TA-104) and (TA-103) of Salmonella typhimurium. In both the Salmonella and Drosophila systems, the nitrilotriacetic acid synergistically increased the mutagenicity of subtoxic doses of chromium(VI) while at higher chromium(VI) dose levels a decline of mutation frequency was noted in the presence of nitrilotriacetic acid, probably as a result of toxicity. Both effects may be referred to enhanced availability of the final genotoxic agent in the presence of nitrilotriacetic acid. The interaction was particularly evident in strains (TA-100) and (TA-104) which carried mutations affecting cell wall permeability and DNA repair. In these strains, the uptake of chromium(VI) and nitrilotriacetic acid was increased and the resulting DNA damage repaired less efficiently or by error prone mechanisms. Nitrilotriacetic acid may facilitate chromate uptake by the anion carriers of the cell membrane. Other mechanisms linked to its chelating action may also be important as suggested by the significant synergistic effect on chromium(VI) mutagenicity produced by ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid at very low doses, which do not modify chromium(VI) reduction by Salmonella proteins in cell free conditions.",

Ammonia is liberated during the synthesis and need not be supplied. The reaction takes place at 80 - 100 \u00b0C. Because of the high pH (ca. 14), triscyanomethylamine N(CH2CN)3 is hydrolyzed in situ to Na3NTA. This process generates three times as much ammonia as it consumes and the ammonia concentration must be limited to suppress the production of substances with low degrees of carboxymethylation (glycine, iminodiacetic acid). This is largely achieved by continuously distilling off the ammonia with steam or air throughout the process. However, formation of byproducts (chiefly glycolic acid, hexamethylenetetramine, and the above-mentioned amino acids) cannot be completely prevented. The resulting solution is sold directly as a 40-wt% solution, or used in the production of Na3NTA.H2O in powder form, or acidified to pH 1-2 to yield the acid (H3NTA).",

The benefits or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The carcinogen should be enclosed in a securely sealed, watertight container (primary container), which should be enclosed in a second, unbreakable, leakproof container that will withstand chem attack from the carcinogen (secondary container). The space between primary & secondary container should be filled with absorbent material, which would withstand chem attack from the carcinogen & is sufficient to absorb the entire contents of the primary container in the event of breakage or leakage. Each secondary container should then be enclosed in a strong outer box. The space between the secondary container & the outer box should be filled with an appropriate quantity of shock-absorbent material. Sender should use fastest & most secure form of transport & notify recipient of its departure. If parcel is not received when expected, carrier should be informed so that immediate effort can be made to find it.

Fischer-344 rats were exposed through diet to the six possible pairs of four chemicals. Tested chemicals and their target organs were as follows: N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, stomach; N-butyl-n-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine, bladder; dipentylnitrosamine, liver; and nitrilotriacetic acid, kidney, ureter, and bladder. A 4x4 factorial design was used to study each chemical pair. Doses were 0, 20, 40, or 80 ppm N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, 0, 30, 60, or 120 ppm N-butyl-n-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine, 0, 50, 150, or 450 ppm dipentylnitrosamine, and 0, 200, 2000, or 20000 ppm nitrilotriacetic acid. The test period was 104 weeks. An independent interaction model was used to compute an index of additivity, which indicated interactions and their types. The endpoints considered were incidence of malignant tumor, time to death from any cause, and time to death with malignant tumor. It was determined that there was no interaction of dipentylnitrosamine with any of the other three carcinogens. Nitrilotriacetic acid in combination with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or N-butyl-n-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine produced antagonism for the target sites of the latter two chemicals, while N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and N-butyl-n-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine did not interact with each other. No synergism was noted for any combination or target site. /It was/ concluded that antagonism can occur when these compounds are given in combination to rats, and although combined exposures can be highly carcinogenic, they do not produce more tumors than implied by independent action models.",

Three common bioassays, namely Daphnia magna, Raphidocelis subcapitata, and Photobacterium phosphoreum (Microtox bioassay) were applied. R. subcapitata proved the most sensitive to these compounds. With D. magna bioassay the LC(50) values were 600-900 mg/L with all other studied chelates and their Mn complexes, except Mn-GA, which yielded LC(50) value of 240 mg/L. The Cd-chelate complexes proved highly more toxic compared to Mn-chelate complexes or uncomplexed chelates exhibiting LC(50) values of 130-200 ug/L...The results from these bioassays were well in agreement to each other as well as with the results published elsewhere.",

Both aluminum nitrilotriacetate (1.0-1.5 mg aluminum/kg/day, n = 12)- and ferric nitrilotriacetate (2.0 mg/kg/day, n = 4) treated Wistar rats showed renal insufficiency blood urea nitrogen levels of 25 + or - 8.8-20 + or - 0.7 compared to 12 + or - 0.7-11 + or - 0.4 mg/dL, osteomalacia with a relative osteoid volume of 31.5 + or - 5.6-13.2 + or - 2.4 compared to 4.6 + or - 1.8-0.83 + or - 0.12%, and bone growth retardation (3.1 + or - 0-3.0 + or - 0.2 compared to 3.4 + or - 0-3.3 + or - 0.1 cm) in 24 control rats. Dietary vitamin E supplementation prevented the iron nitrilotriacetate induced impairment, but not the aluminum nitrilotriacetate toxicity. Aluminum was deposited at the interface between osteoid and mineralized bone, while iron was deposited in the osteoblasts and osteoclasts. There seems to be a positive correlation between hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia but carboxy terminal parathyroid hormone and calcium levels in the serum were not related to the degree of osteomalacia. Administration of aluminum nitrilotriacetate results in more bone aluminum deposition than that of aluminum chloride (450 + or - 40 compared to 211 + or - 18 mg/kg fat free dry weight). The iron nitrilotriacetate bone change is related to vitamin E preventable cellular injury, being consistent with the notion that iron nitrilotriacetate toxicity is caused by lipid peroxidation. aluminum nitrilotriacetate can be used as an animal model of renal osteodystrophy. Osteodystrophy by Al in chronic renal failure may be mediated by the intrinsic chelator or chelating substance(s) retained in the body fluid due to renal insufficiency.",

Similar bioassays, using rats & mice were conducted on the free acid, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). Each cmpd was mixed in respective diets & admin ad libitum. The Na3NTA H2O was tested in rats at 200, 2,000 & 20,000 ppm for 24 mo period. It was also tested in rats at 7,500 & 15,000 ppm & in mice at 2,500 & 5,000 ppm using 18 mo feeding periods for both species. The nitrilotriacetic acid was tested at 7,500 & 15,000 ppm for the 18 mo period. The number of animals used in tests were 24 of each sex for each dose group for the controls; at 50 of each sex for each dose group & 20 of each sex for the controls. Since equimolar quantities of Na3NTA H2O & nitrilotriacetic acid were not used, given concn of Na3NTA H2O represented 30% less nitrilotriacetic acid than did equal concn of the free acid. ... /Under the conditions of these bioassays/ nitrilotriacetic acid & Na3NTA H2O were shown to be carcinogenic to the urinary tracts of both rats & mice at higher doses tested. Lower doses, as indicated ... did not induce significant numbers of such lesions.",

Plants were exposed for 6 days to 126 uM Cu and 500 uM NTA in nutrient solutions without and with 10 g/L montmorillonite. Approximately seven times less Cu was dissolved in the montmorillonite solutions than in the nutrient solutions alone. In the absence of NTA, montmorillonite effectively competed with plant roots for Cu, although Cu remained bound to the roots. Nitrilotriacetate increased Cu uptake and translocation into shoots of tobacco by a factor of 3.5 from the nutrient solution and by a factor of 26 from the montmorillonite nutrient solution. Neither growth reduction nor any other visible sign of Cu toxicity was found in the presence of NTA with Cu concentrations of 190 mg/kg in the shoots. In the absence of NTA, high Cu concentrations in root samples led to a brownish discoloration of the roots.",

Plants were grown in a sandy soil with added CdS at four levels ranging from 50 to 200 mg Cd/kg soil. After 30 days of growth, pots were amended with NTA or citric acid at 10 and 20 mmol/kg. Control pots were not treated with chelates. Harvest of plants was performed immediately before and one week after chelate addition. Soil water-, NH(4)NO(3)- and EDTA-extractable Cd fractions increased constantly with both increasing soil metal application and chelate concentration. Shoot dry weights did not suffer significant reductions with increasing Cd addition to the soil except for both NTA treatments in which at 200 mg Cd/kg a 30% decrease in dry matter was observed. Generally, following NTA and citric acid amendments, Cd concentration in shoots increased with soil Cd level. However, due to Cd toxicity, at the highest metal application rate both NTA treatments lowered Cd concentration in the above-ground parts. Compared to the control, at 10 mmol/kg citric acid did not change Cd concentration in shoots, whereas NTA-treated plants showed an about 2-fold increase. The addition of chelates at 20 mmol/kg further enhanced Cd concentration in shoots up to 718 and 560 ug/g dry weight in the NTA and citrate treatments, respectively.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates nitrilotriacetic acid will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase nitrilotriacetic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Nitrilotriacetic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, nitrilotriacetic acid is expected to have high to moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of <286. The pKa1 of nitrilotriacetic acid is 3.03, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Biodegradation is expected to be the dominant degradation process in soils. In soil degradation studies in five different soils, nitrilotriacetic acid biodegraded under both aerobic and water logged (presumably anaerobic) conditions; after 7-days of incubation, degradation was 6-30% (average 22.4%) in aerobic soil and 9-34% (average 25.4%) in water logged soil with no degradation in sterilized soil. If released into water, nitrilotriacetic acid is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation of nitrilotriacetic acid in water is expected based on several river die-away studies that measured half-lives ranging from 0.34 to 15 days. Nitrilotriacetic acid was rapidly biodegraded in stream water (100% in 10 days) but poorly degraded in an estuarine water; the degradation was inversely proportional to salinity. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's pKa1. BCFs of <9 to 109 measured in carp (Cyprinus carpio) suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. The photolytic half-life of the Fe(III) complex of nitrilotriacetic acid in the top layer of a water body was calculated to be 42.9 min at max sunlight intensity. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to nitrilotriacetic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where nitrilotriacetic acid is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to nitrilotriacetic acid ingestion of drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound or other products containing nitrilotriacetic acid.

The pKa1 of nitrilotriacetic acid is 3.03(3), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Volatilization of nitrilotriacetic acid from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given its pKa1(3). Nitrilotriacetic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 7X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5). Biodegradation is expected to be the dominant degradation process in soils(6-7). Reviews of biodegradation screening studies have noted that nitrilotriacetic acid is readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions, moderate temperatures and acclimation(6-7). However, degradation under anaerobic conditions or cold temperatures may be slow(6-7). In soil degradation studies in five different soils, nitrilotriacetic acid biodegraded under both aerobic and water logged (presumably anaerobic) conditions; after 7-days of incubation, degradation was 6-30% (average 22.4%) in aerobic soil and 9-34% (average 25.4%) in water logged soil with no degradation in sterilized soil(8)."

A pKa of 3.03(3) indicates nitrilotriacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), BCFs of <9 to 24 and 109 measured in carp (Cyprinus carpio) exposed for 28 days(5), suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate(SRC). Based upon laboratory photodegradation studies, the photolytic half-life of the Fe(III) complex of nitrilotriacetic acid in the top layer of a water body was calculated to be 42.9 min at a solar spectrum at 60 deg N latitude under max sunlight intensity(6); actual photolysis rates in the environment are expected to be much slower due to various retardation factors(6). Nitrilotriacetic acid is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(7). Nitrilotriacetic acid can be expected to biodegrade in aquatic ecosystems(8). Under optimal conditions (moderate ambient temperatures, low loading concentrations, aerobic systems), it will biodegrade readily(8). Under anaerobic conditions, biodegradation may be very slow(8). Several river die-away studies have measured half-lives ranging from 0.34 to 15 days(9-13). Nitrilotriacetic acid was rapidly biodegraded in stream water (100% in 10 days) but poorly degraded in an estuarine water(14); the degradation was inversely proportional to salinity(14)."

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

In a die-away test Ohio River water, 100% degradation was observed after 12-14 days of incubation which included an 8-10 day lag period(2). In aerobic die-away tests using Detroit and Meramec River water, 100% degradation was observed after 3-15 days of incubation(3). In river die-away tests using river water from both upstream and downstream of the Heath, OH treatment plant, 100% degradation occurred within 10 days in the downstream water and within 16 days in the upstream water(4). In die-away tests using freshwater-sediment from Hamilton Harbor, Lake Erie, 100% degradation occurred in 3-11 days of incubation at input concentrations of 1-12 ppm(5). In CO2 evolution tests using river water inocula from various sites (Fukushima, Japan; Perkinsville, IN; Brantford, Ontario; Cincinnati, OH) located downstream from treatment plants and low concentrations of nitrilotriacetic acid (0.001-1 ppm), rate constants ranging from 0.12 to 1.28/day were measured which correspond to half-lives of 0.54 to 5.8 days(6). Nitrilotriacetic acid was rapidly degraded in river die-away studies using Grand River (Ontario, Can) water and Ohio River water(7); half-lives in the Grand River water ranged from 0.34-0.64 days while the Ohio River water had a 15-day CO2 evolution of 90%(7). Mineralization of nitrilotriacetic acid in Cayuga Lake water (Ithaca, NY) was 90% or greater in 20 days of incubation at concentrations of 1 ug/mL and 10 ng/mL(8); however, at 0.1 ng/L, mineralization was much slower (about 15% in 60 days)(8).",

In die-away tests using estuarine water from the Newport River, NC, CO2 evolution rates of 0.0012/hr (6 \u00b0C) and 0.0014/hr (14 \u00b0C) were measured(2) which correspond to half-lives of 24 and 21 days; in additional studies using waters from various sections of the Newport estuary, rate constants of 0.0013 to 0.00933/hr (6-14 \u00b0C) were determined(3) which correspond to half-lives of 3.1 and 22 days(SRC). The initial biodegradation half-life of nitrilotriacetic acid in German estuarine waters was found to range from 4 to 29 days at 12.2 \u00b0C(4). The biodegradation (via CO2 evolution) of nitrilotriacetic acid was examined in three estuarine ecosystem waters(5); in previously unpolluted water, degradation was slow (30% in 70 days) while degradation in water exposed to nitrilotriacetic acid for more than 10 years was rapid (50% in 6-12 days)(5).",

In a 21-day aerobic CO2 evolution study using an acclimated activated sludge inocula, a theoretical BOD of 80% was measured(1); a rate constant of 0.36/day (half-life of 2.0 days) was also calculated(1). An 85% degradation rate was observed in an aerobic biological treatment simulation (OECD Continuous Detergent Test) using an activated sludge seed(2). Removal efficiencies of 55-100% were measured in an aerobic biological treatment simulation (continuous feed) using both normal influent loading and shock loading(3). In an OECD screening test, >80% of the nitrilotriacetic acid degraded (based upon %DOC removal) in 24 days(4). Using the Coupled Units screening test, a degradation of 95% (based upon %DOC removal) was observed(5). In a Sturm CO2 evolution test using an acclimated inoculum, degradation rates ranged from 4% after 2 days to 97% after 17 days(6); using the OECD screening test, degradation ranged from 41% after 7 days to 100% after 21 days(6). Nitrilotriacetic acid, present at 100 mg/L, reached 1% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(7).

Respirometric biodegradation tests for nitrilotriacetic acid had reported results of; 81% biodegradation at a rate constant of 0.214/day and a 14 day lag time for Sapromat test and 70% biodegradation at a rate constant of 0.564/day and a 9 day lag period for Oxitop test(2). In screening tests using activated sludge seeds, nitrilotriacetic acid was rapidly degraded after the seed was acclimated to nitrilotriacetic acid(3); an acclimation period of roughly one week was required to acclimate the seed(3); 8-day to 20-day theoretical BODs of 73 to 100% were measured with acclimated seeds(3). A 7-day theoretical CO2 evolution of 75% was found using an acclimated soil inoculum(4); the temperature effected CO2 evolution(4); a 24-day CO2 evolution of 80% was measured at 24 \u00b0C while CO2 evolutions of only 1-25% were measured at 2 \u00b0C(4). In an aerobic biological treatment simulation experiment, degradations of 98, 94, 60 and 3% were measured at respective temperatures of 20, 10, 7.5 and 5 \u00b0C(5). A 100% degradation was observed in an aerobic biological treatment simulator using a sewage inoculum(6). In an aerobic biological treatment simulation experiment, degradations of 98 and 70% were measured at concentrations of 20 and 50 mg/L, respectively(7). Nitrilotriacetic acid concentrations of 0.5-7.5 ppm did not degrade under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions in biodegradation tests using sewage inoculum and marine water(8). Nitrilotriacetic acid degraded readily (70-95% with a half-life of 4-6 hr) in biological treatment simulation using an acclimated sludge(9). In a CO2 evolution study using a sludge inocula, nitrilotriacetic acid degraded rapidly after a 2-day lag period with >95% theoretical evolution after 4 days(10). Nitrilotriacetic acid was biodegraded in activated sludge after acclimation for 23 days(11). Nitrilotriacetic acid-degrading microorganisms were originally limited in a conventional sludge, but they were induced and increased while activated sludge was acclimated with nitrilotriacetic acid(11). The behavior of nitrilotriacetic acid was investigated in the winter and summer in the sewage treatment plant Zurich-Glatt in Switzerland(12). For an initial concentration of 1500 ug/L of nitrilotriacetic acid, it was biologically degraded up to 97%(12).",

The biodegradation of nitrilotriacetic acid was examined (via CO2 evolution) in subsurface soils taken from a septic tank tile field(2-3); under aerobic conditions the half-life was 86-161 hr, while under anaerobic conditions the half-life was 49-125 hr(2-3); the more rapid mineralization under anaerobic conditions is probably due to the presence of nitrate ion which acts as a terminal electron acceptor(3). Mineralization of nitrilotriacetic acid in Mardin silt loam soil (taken from a forest in Dryden, NY) was approximately 25% complete after 30 hr incubation(4). In soil degradation studies using agricultural top soil, 100% degradation of nitrilotriacetic acid occurred after 8-14 days of incubation(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

There are more than 100 different PAHs. PAHs generally occur as complex mixtures (for example, as part of combustion products such as soot), not as single compounds. PAHs usually occur naturally, but they can be manufactured as individual compounds for research purposes; however, not as the mixtures found in combustion products. ... Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar. They are found throughout the environment in the air, water, and soil. They can occur in the air, either attached to dust particles or as solids in soil or sediment. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

Chemical analysis is performed via laser-excited time-resolved Shpol'skii spectroscopy with the aid of a cryogenic fiber-optic probe, pulsed tunable dye laser, spectrograph, and intensified charge-coupled device. Unambiguous identification is accomplished via wavelength time matrix formats, which give simultaneous access to spectral and lifetime information. Prior to spectroscopic analysis, HPLC fractions are pre-treated with liquid-liquid extraction or solid-liquid extraction at the tip of the fiber-optic probe. Solid-liquid extraction gives the best limits of detection, which vary from 40 pg/mL (dibenzo[a,l]pyrene) to 0.2 ng/mL (dibenzo[e,l]pyrene).",

Its four isomers, which include dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, and dibenzo[e,l]pyrene, are also carcinogenic and, therefore, a potential threat to humans. The method presented here provides a direct way for their determination in water samples. The entire procedure - from water extraction to LETRSS analysis - takes less than 15 min/sample and it consumes only 100 microL of organic solvent. This fact makes our approach environmentally friendly and cost-effective. Unambiguous isomer determination is accomplished via multidimensional data formats, namely, wavelength time matrixes, excitation-emission matrixes, and time-resolved excitation-emission matrixes. The analytical figures of merit demonstrate precise and accurate analysis at the sub-parts-per-billion level. Limits of detection are at the parts-per-trillion level. The potential of this approach for real-world analysis is illustrated with a heavily contaminated water samples.",

The method can also be used for analysis of the PAH benzo(a)pyrene, coronene, and perylene, for which reference and certified values are available for the standard reference materials used for validation of the method--SRM 1649a (urban dust) and SRM 2975 (diesel particulate matter). The only NIST values that have been published for these dibenzopyrene isomers in the analyzed SRM are reference values for dibenzo(a,i)pyrene and dibenzo(a,h)pyrene in SRM 1649a. The concentrations determined in the SRM were in good agreement with reported NIST-certified and reference values and other concentrations reported in the literature. Standard reference material 1650 (diesel particulate matter) was also analyzed. The method could not, however, be validated using this material because certification of SRM 1650 had expired. The method is based on ultrasonically assisted extraction of the particulate material, then silica SPE pre-separation and isolation, and, separation and detection by hyphenated LC-GC-MS. The method is relatively rapid and requires only approximately 1-5 mg SRM particulate material to identify and quantify the analytes. Low extraction recoveries for the analytes, in particular the dibenzopyrenes, when extracting diesel SRM 2975 and 1650 resulted, however, in the dibenzopyrenes being present in amounts near their limits of quantifications in these samples. The method's limit of quantification (LOQ), based on analyses of SRM 1649a, is in the range 10-77 pg. By use of this method more than 25 potential PAH isomers with a molecular weight of 302 could be separated.",

                                "Description": "The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical is an airborne concentration at which a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effect.  There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

ANIMAL STUDIES: A group of 24 female mice received a single dermal application of 240 ug DB(a,h)P; a control group of 23 mice was treated with the solvent alone. One week later, all mice received twice weekly dermal applications of 4.26 nmol 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in 100 uL acetone for 25 weeks. Papillomas occurred in 18/24 mice treated with DB(a,h)P (5.3 tumors/mouse) compared with 2/23 solvent-treated control mice (0.1 tumors/mouse). One study found 2 tumors in 4 rats dying after 7 to 8 months following im administration of 0.5-1.0 mg of DB(a,h)P. The duration of the experiment was at least 8 months. In another study, 6 female rats were injected with single dose of 0.5 mg DB(a,h)P, and 2 sarcomas appeared at 5.5 and 8 months. DB(a,h)P was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TM67 with or without metabolic activation. DB(a,h)P was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100.",

Although the biological properties of many pure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been investigated, less is known about their effects when present as components of mixtures. As the ability to form DNA adducts in vivo is generally indicative of carcinogenic activity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, we have compared the DNA binding potencies of dibenzo(a,e)pyrene (DB(a,e)P), dibenzo(a,h)pyrene (DB(a,h)P), dibenzo(a,i)pyrene (DB(a,i)P), dibenzo(a,l)pyrene (DB(a,l)P) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), when applied topically, either singly or in combination, to the skin of male Parkes mice. DNA isolated from the skin and lungs was analyzed by (32)P-postlabelling. The adducts formed by each polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exhibited markedly different chromatographic mobilities on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates. The relative binding potencies of the compounds in both skin and lungs were: dibenzo(a,l)pyrene > dibenzo(a,i)pyrene > dibenzo(a,e)pyrene, in good agreement with their reported carcinogenicities in mouse skin. The majority of adducts were removed from DNA within 21 days of treatment, but low levels of adducts were found to persist for at least 3 months in both tissues. When dibenzo(a,l)pyrene, dibenzo(a,e)pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene were applied together to mouse skin, a total binding 31% lower than expected was detected, while with a mixture of dibenzo(a,e)pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene the binding to DNA in skin was 65% higher than expected from the binding levels of the carcinogenes when applied singly. Other binary combinations of these three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons gave adduct levels similar to the sum of the binding levels of the individual components when applied singly. The results demonstrate the usefulness of (32)P-post-labelling for the assessment of the DNA binding potencies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in mouse tissues, and for the detection of interactions between components of mixtures of carcinogens.",

The relationships between the chemical structure of 9 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and antagonistic effects on the 1-NP-induced mutation were evaluated by the binary mixtures of 1-NP and PAHs with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the absence of S9 mix. Remarkably different antagonistic effects of 9 PAHs on the mutagenicity of 1-NP were observed. Among the tested PAHs, coronene demonstrates the most antagonistic potential followed by benzo[g,h,i]perylene (B[g,h,i]P), benzo[e]pyrene (B[e]P), dibenzo[a,h]pyrene (DB[a,h]P), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and pyrene. Naphthalene, anthracene, and chrysene had only minor inhibitory activity on the 1-NP mutagenicity. The modifying effects of PAHs on the nitroreductase activity of TA98 strains in the presence of 1-NP were further examined from the production of 1-AP. The statistical analytical data showed that the inhibitory effect of PAHs on the mutagenicity of 1-NP significantly correlated with their effects on the nitroreductase activity (r = -0.69, p < 0.05). In addition, the formation of 1-NP-DNA adducts of the binary mixtures of 1-NP and PAH was determined by the (32)P-postlabeling method. The results indicated that the modulatory effects of PAHs on the formation of 1-NP-DNA adducts were correlated well with their antagonistic activity (r = -0.91, P < 0.01). From the above results, the relationships between the chemical structure of PAHs and the antagonistic effects on the 1-NP mutagenicity were revealed by the surface area and electronic parameters of PAHs. The planar molecular area of PAHs was more convincingly correlated with the antagonistic effect on the mutagenicity of 1-NP (r = -0.81, p < 0.01) than that with the difference in energy, delta E, between EHOMO and ELUMO (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). According to the above, two possible mechanisms are involved in the interactive effect of the binary mixtures: (1) a higher binding affinity with nitroreductase for PAHs having a large planar surface area; and (2) a high energy of interaction between 1-NP and PAHs with a low delta E might decrease the nitroreductive capability.",

The mutagenicity of 0.05 nmol of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium is inhibited 50% by incubation of the bacteria and the diol epoxide with 150 nmol of ferulic acid, 75 nmol of caffeic acid, 50 nmol of chlorogenic acid or, most strikingly, 1 nmol of ellagic acid in the 0.5-ml incubation mixture. A 3-nmol dose of ellagic acid inhibits mutation induction by 90%. Ellagic acid is also a potent antagonist of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in Chinese hamster V79 cells. Mutations to 8-azaguanine resistance induced by 0.2 uM diol epoxide are reduced by 50% when tissue culture media also contains 2 uM ellagic acid. Similar to results obtained with the bacteria, ferulic, caffeic, and chlorogenic acids are approximately two orders of magnitude less active than ellagic acid in the mammalian cell assay. The antimutagenic effects of the plant phenols result from their direct interaction with B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2, because a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of diol epoxide disappearance in cell-free solutions of 1:9 dioxane/water, pH 7.0, is observed with all four phenols. In parallel with the mutagenicity studies, ellagic acid is 80-300 times more effective than the other phenols in accelerating the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2. Ellagic acid at 10 uM increases the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 by approximately 20-fold relative to the spontaneous and hydronium ion-catalyzed hydrolysis of the diol epoxide at pH 7.0. Ellagic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of the mutagenic activity of bay-region diol epoxides of benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, but higher concentrations of ellagic acid are needed to inhibit the mutagenic activity of the chemically less reactive bay-region diol epoxides of benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, and benzo[c]phenanthrene. These studies demonstrate that ellagic acid is a potent antagonist of the adverse biological effects of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolites of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and suggest that this naturally occurring plant phenol, normally ingested by humans, may inhibit the carcinogenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",

To better understand the mutagenicity of this class of compounds, 11 C24H14 PAH, including benzo[a]perylene, benzo[b]perylene, dibenzo[a,e]fluoranthene, dibenzo[a,f]fluoranthene, dibenzo[j,l]fluoranthene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, dibenzo[e,l]pyrene, naphtho[1,2-b]fluoranthene, naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene, and naphtho[2,3-e]pyrene, were tested in a mutagenicity assay based on human h1A1v2 cells. h1A1v2 cells are a line of human B-lymphoblastoid cells that have been engineered to express cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1), an enzyme capable of metabolizing promutagenic PAH. Mutagenicity was measured at the thymidine kinase (tk) locus following a 72-hr exposure period. Our results show that nine of the compounds were mutagenic. Benzo[a]perylene, dibenzo[a,e]fluoranthene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, and naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene were the most potent mutagens, having minimum mutagenic concentrations (MMC) (i.e., the dose at which the induced response was twice that of the negative controls) in the 1-5 ng/mL range. Benzo[b]perylene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, dibenzo[a,f]fluoranthene, and naphtho[2,3-e]pyrene were somewhat less potent mutagens, having MMC in the 10-30 ng/mL range. Dibenzo[e,l]pyrene, which had an MMC of 280 ng/mL, was the least potent mutagen. Dibenzo[j,l]fluoranthene and naphtho[1,2-b]fluoranthene were not mutagenic at the doses tested (1-3000 ng/mL). The most mutagenic compounds were also quite toxic. At the highest doses tested, benzo[a]perylene, dibenzo[a,e]fluoranthene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,f]fluoranthene induced > 60% killing, and naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene and naphtho[2,3-e]pyrene induced > 50% killing. Benzo[b]perylene, dibenzo[e,l]pyrene, dibenzo[j,l]fluoranthene, and naphtho[1,2-b]fluoranthene induced < 50% killing at the highest doses tested. Comparing these results to a previous study in which nine other C24H14 PAH were tested for mutagenicity in this same assay, it was found that dibenzo[a]pyrene isomers were generally more mutagenic than the other groups of C24H14 PAH tested. ...",

DB[al]P and B[a]P, both potent animal carcinogens, were the most mutagenic substances in both assays. DB[al]P was nearly 50-fold more potent than B[a]P in human cells, but only 60% more mutagenic in Salmonella. The carcinogenic isomer DB[ah]P, though nonmutagenic in bacteria, was active in human cells. The following mutagenic potency series, expressed as the minimum detectable mutagen concentration (MDMC) in nmol/ml, was obtained with Salmonella in the presence of rat liver postmitochondrial supernatant (PMS): DB[al]P (3.7), B[a]P (5.8), DB[ae]P (6.9), DB[ai]P (14.9), DB[ah]P (> 100). None of the compounds were mutagenic in the absence of PMS. In human MCL-5 cells the potency series was: DB[al]P (3.1 x 10(-4)), B[a]P (1.5 x 10(-2)), DB[ae]P (2.5 x 10(-2)), DB[ah]P (0.5), DB[ai]P (3.2). The human cell assay thus exhibited over a 10,000-fold range between the most mutagenic and least mutagenic compound, whereas in the bacterial assay there was only a corresponding four-fold difference if the nonmutagenic DB[ah]P was excluded. ...",

However, in many countries including Japan, only benzo[a]pyrene is regulated, though more toxic PAHs than benzo[a]pyrene have been reported. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the risk of atmospheric PAHs and to find major contributing compounds that can act as suitable indicators for estimating and monitoring the risk of PAHs as a whole. The primary objectives of this study are to investigate the risk of 22 combined atmospheric PAHs and to find major contributing compounds that can act as adequate indicators for estimating the risk. The average lifetime cancer risk for all 22 PAHs in winter was 1.7 x 10(-4) in the Yokohama residential area. Although benzo[a]pyrene has been considered to be a useful indicator in many countries, the present study also showed that benzo[a]pyrene contributed only ca. 40% of the total cancer risk for all 22 PAHs, as calculated by unit risk. Six PAHs (dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]perylene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene) contributed 93% of the overall risk. Therefore, these six PAHs, including the high molecular ones, would be better indicators of the risk than benzo[a]pyrene alone. The secondary objective of this study is to reveal the PAHs that are major contributors to the deposition that contribute to the total deposition of PAHs in the human respiratory tract. The results revealed that the same six PAHs identified using unit risk evaluation were large contributors in all five parts of the respiratory tracts in adult males in spite of deposition process. It was concluded that the reason for this was that these six PAHs had the same size distributions, of which the 0.43-1.1 um fraction was the largest, about 57-70% of the whole concentration.",

It is present as a component of the total content of PAHs in the environment. Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene occurs in tobacco smoke, gasoline and diesel engine exhaust, stack emissions of waste incinerators, in coal combustion stack emissions, and in curing smoke. Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene occurs in fossil fuels and is released to air from volcanoes and forest fires. There is no commercial production or known use for dibenzo(a,h)pyrene. If released to air, an estimated super-cooled vapor pressure of 6.4X10-12 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibenzo(a,h)pyrene will exist almost entirely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. However, a small percentage may exist in the vapor phase. Vapor-phase dibenzo(a,h)pyrene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours. Particulate-phase dibenzo(a,h)pyrene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dibenzo(a,h)pyrene is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 6.3X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene showed no biodegradation after a 29-day incubation period in a bioslurry reactor using contaminated soil from a previous gasworks facility. PAHs with four or more rings, such as dibenzo(a,h)pyrene, are expected to be resistant to biodegradation. Photolysis may occur on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight. If released into water, dibenzo(a,h)pyrene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 9600 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to dibenzo(a,h)pyrene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dibenzo(a,h)pyrene is produced as a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dibenzo(a,h)pyrene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and dermal contact with particulate matter resulting from combustion.

Volatilization of dibenzo(a,h)pyrene from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 6.4X10-12 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2). Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene showed no biodegradation after a 29-day incubation period in a bioslurry reactor using contaminated soil from a previous gasworks facility(3). In general, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with five or more benzene rings may not biodegrade readily(4). PAHs with four or more rings, such as dibenzo(a,h)pyrene, are expected to be resistant to biodegradation(5). Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 9600(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 7.28(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(5). In general, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with five or more benzene rings may not biodegrade readily(6). PAHs with four or more rings, such as dibenzo(a,h)pyrene, are expected to be resistant to biodegradation(7). Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(8) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on water surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC). Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

Based on an estimated super-cooled vapor pressure of 1.3X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(2), a small percentage of dibenzo(a,h)pyrene may exist in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere(1). Similar PAHs have been detected in the vapor phase in ambient air(3,4). Vapor-phase dibenzo(a,h)pyrene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase dibenzo(a,h)pyrene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(5,6) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

In one biodegradation study, the half-life for the largest PAH studied, benzo(a)pyrene, was 875 days in petroleum-contaminated sediment; rates in pristine sediment were 10 to 400 times slower(3). On this basis, dibenzo(a,h)pyrene is expected to be resistant to biodegradation. PAHs with four or more rings, such as dibenzo(a,h)pyrene, are expected to be resistant to biodegradation(4).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 7.7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Dibenzo(a,h)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(3,4) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). While no photolysis rates have been located for dibenzo(a,h)pyrene, photolysis in aqueous media may be rapid in view of the fact that larger polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons tend to photolyze more rapidly than smaller ones(5) and that larger PAHs, such as benzo(a)pyrene, have a photolysis half-life of 1 hr in sunlight(6).",

However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(3). Some marine organisms have no detectable aryl hydrocarbons hydroxylase enzyme systems, namely: phytoplankton, certain zooplankton, mussels (Mytilus edulis), scallops (Placopecten sp), and snails (Litternia littorea)(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

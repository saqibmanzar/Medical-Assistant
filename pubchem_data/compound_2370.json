As a cholinergic agent, bethanechol is similar in structure and pharmacological function to acetylcholine and is used in specific cases when stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system is necessary.

An advantage of bethanechol is that in contrast to acetylcholine, bethanechol is not degraded by cholinesterase allowing its effects to be longer-lasting.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Though there are 5 types of muscarinic receptors (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5), binding of bethanechol to M3 is most clinically significant since M3 receptors are present in intestinal smooth muscle and the bladder. The cholinergic effects of bethanechol lead to increased detrusor muscle tone to promote bladder emptying and increased smooth muscle tone which restores gastrointestinal peristalsis and motility.  As a result of selectivity for muscarinic receptors, bethanechol produces minimal to no nicotinic effects.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

In this study, the antithrombotic and antiplatelet activities of borneol were investigated on thrombosis in vivo and on platelet aggregation ex-vivo. In addition, the coagulation parameters and influence on fibrinolytic activity were also assessed. The results showed that borneol had concentration dependent inhibitory effects on arterio-venous shunt and venous thrombosis but no effect on ADP and AA-induced platelet aggregation. Meanwhile, borneol prolonged the coagulation parameters for prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT), but did not show any fibrinolytic activity. It suggested that the antithrombotic activity of borneol and its action in combined formula for preventing cardiovascular diseases might be due to anticoagulant activity rather than antiplatelet activity. /Traditional medicine/",

Isoborneol did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity at concentrations ranging between 0.016% and 0.08% when tested against human and monkey cell lines. Isoborneol specifically inhibited glycosylation of viral polypeptides based on the following data: (1) the mature fully glycosylated forms of two viral glycoproteins gB and gD were not detected when the virus was replicated in the presence of isoborneol, (2) no major changes were observed in the glycosylation pattern of cellular polypeptides between untreated and isoborneol treated Vero cells, (3) isoborneol did not affect the glycosylation of gB produced from a copy of the gB gene resident in the cellular genome, and (4) other monoterpenes such as 1,8-cineole and borneol, a stereoisomer of isoborneol, did not inhibit HSV-1 glycosylation.",

The drug in tissues was extracted with ethyl acetate, and borneol's concentration detected by GC, with octadecane as the internal standard. The calibration curve showed a good linear relationship. Extraction recoveries, inter-day and intra-day precisions and stability were in conformity with the analytical requirements of biological samples. Borneol was mainly distributed in most tissues, more in heart, brain and kidney, and less in liver, spleen and lung. The established GC-FID method is applicable for content determination of borneol in tissues. After intravenous and intranasal administrations in mice, borneol is mainly distributed in abundant blood-supply tissues. After intranasal administration, brain tissues showed the highest target coefficient and target effectiveness.",

In order to understand the blood and brain pharmacokinetics after intravenous, intranasal, or oral administration and to investigate the superiority and feasibility of intranasal administration, a simple gas chromatographic (GC) method with flame ionization detection (FID) was developed for the quantification of borneol. Blood samples and brain were collected from mice at 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after intravenous, intranasal, or oral administration of borneol at a dosage of 30.0 mg/kg. Sample preparations were carried out by liquid-liquid extraction with an internal standard solution of octadecane. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated /using computer software/. The calibration curves were linear in the range of 0.11-84.24 ug/mL and 0.16-63.18 ug/g for borneol in plasma and brain, respectively. The methodological and extraction recoveries were both in the range of 85%-115%. The intra-day and inter-day variabilities for plasma and brain samples were </= 5.00% relative standard deviation (RSD). The absolute bioavailabilities F of intranasal and oral administrations were 90.68% and 42.99%. The relative brain targeted coefficients Re of intranasal and oral administrations were 68.37% and 38.40%. The GC-FID method developed could be applied to determination and pharmacokinetic study. The borneol from injection was distributed and metabolized fast without absorption process. The borneol from oral administration was distributed more slowly and had the lowest absolute bioavailability. Nasal administration of borneol was quickly absorbed into the blood and brain, was easy to use and had a greater safety than infection, which makes it worthy of further development as an administration route for encephalopathy treatment.",

A novel single pass in situ nasal perfusion technique was applied to examine the rate and extent of nasal absorption of borneol by rats. Experimental conditions, such as perfusion rate, pH and drug concentration, were investigated. The in situ experiments showed that the nasal absorption of borneol was not dependent on drug concentration, and fitted a first order process. The absorption rate constant, Ka, influenced with an increase in perfusion speed. The borneol was well absorbed in the conditions of the nasal cavity within the pH range and pH value of physiological conditions. In vivo studies of borneol absorption were carried out in rats and the pharmacokinetics parameters of intranasal (in) was compared with intravenous (iv) administration. The bioavailabilities of borneol was 90.82% for i.n. while Tmax values were 10 min. MRT (Mean Residence Time) were 262.55 +/- 67.35 min and 204.22 +/- 14.50 min for in and iv methods, respectively. The results demonstrate that borneol could be absorbed promptly and thoroughly by in administration in rats.",

The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between excitation ratio [contents of excitatory amino acids (AAs) versus that of inhibitory] and the content of natural borneol after a single oral dose. Mice were administered a 1.2 g/kg dose of natural borneol (containing 98% D: -borneol) by oral ingestion. Brain samples were collected before administration and at 0.083, 0.167, 0.25, 0.333, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 hr after administration. The brain concentration of natural borneol and contents of AA neurotransmitters in mice brain were determined by GC-MS and HPLC-FLU, respectively. After per oral application, natural borneol was absorbed rapidly into the brain and could be determined 5 min after dosing. The maximal brain concentration (86.52 ug/g) was reached after 1 hr post-dosing. Natural borneol could affect the contents of AA neurotransmitters in mice brain: L: -aspartic acid increased significantly from 0.083 to 1 hr after administration, L: -glutamic acid increased significantly at 0.333 hr and decreased from 1.5 to 5 hr, gamma-amino-N-butyric acid increased significantly from 0.167 to 5 hr, whereas glycine was not affected. The excitation ratio is the contents of excitatory AAs versus that of inhibitory AAs, which reflects the excitatory or inhibitory state of the body. The excitation ratio elevated transitorily and then declined 0.5 hr post-dosing; there were significant differences between 1.5-5 hr post-dose compared with pre-dose. The present study indicated that natural borneol could affect the contents of AA neurotransmitters, and the change in excitatory ratio led to borneol's double side effects on the CNS.",

Isoborneol-treated barriers did not affect termite survival. The bioavailability of the active ingredient decreased with increasing clay content of the soil. Evaporation of isoborneol from treated soil increased with increasing particle size of the substrate and could be reduced by covering the soil surface.",

Although some borneol is still made by tapping trees, the vast majority of it is created synthetically from turpentine oil or camphor.

The optimal MAE conditions obtained were: acetone for solvent, with solvent having sample ratio of 12:1 (v/w); microwave power of 380 W, and an irradiation time of 4 min. Method validations were also studied. To demonstrate the proposed method, ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) and steam distillation (SD), followed by GC-FID, were used to analyze camphor and borneol in the three TCMs. The close results were obtained by the three methods. The results showed that the proposed MAE-GC-FID is a simple, rapid, and reliable method for quantitative analysis of camphor and borneol in TCM, and is also a potential tool for TCM quality assessment.",

Herein, a reliable method by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with an optical rotation detector was developed to separate isoborneol enantiomers. A cellulose tris(3, 5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)-coated chiral stationary phase showed the best separation performance for isoborneol enantiomers in the normal phase among four polysaccharide chiral packings. The effects of alcoholic modifiers and column temperature were studied in detail. Resolution of the isoborneol racemate displayed a downward trend along with an increase in the content of ethanol and column temperature, indicating that less ethanol in the mobile phase and lower temperature were favorable to this process. Moreover, two isoborneol enantiomers were obtained via a semipreparative chiral HPLC technique under optimum conditions, and further characterized by analytical HPLC, and experimental and calculated vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, respectively. The solution VCD spectrum of the first-eluted component was consistent with the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculated pattern based on the SSS configuration, indicating that this enantiomer should be (1S, 2S, 4S)-(+)-isoborneol. Briefly, these results have provided reliable information to establish a method for analysis, preparative separation, and absolute configuration of chiral compounds without typical chromophoric groups.",

The resulting n-hexane extract (20 uL) was introduced into a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry system using programmable temperature vaporizing-based large-volume injection. The assay was validated to demonstrate its reliability for the intended use. Using this assay, pharmacokinetic studies of Bingpian, synthetic Bingpian, and Fufang-Danshen tablets (containing synthetic Bingpian) were conducted in rats. ... The extraction efficiency for the analytes and the internal standard from plasma was almost constant with decrease in n-hexane-to-plasma volume ratio, thus enabling a small volume of extracting solvent to be used for sample preparation, and enhancing the assay sensitivity. The lower quantification limit for measuring borneol, isoborneol, and camphor in plasma was 0.98 nmol/L, which was 33-330 times more sensitive than those reported earlier for Bingpian and synthetic Bingpian. The applicability of the miniaturized liquid-liquid extraction technique could be extended to measure other volatile and nonvolatile medicinal compounds in biomatrices, which can be predicted according to the analytes' octanol/water distribution coefficient (logD) and acid dissociation constant (pKa).",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Borneol does not present a concern for skin sensitization. Toxicity is essentially indistinguishable from that of camphor. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed to varying concentrations of l-borneol in DMSO up to 600 ug/mL for 4 hr, with and without metabolic activation and 24 hr without metabolic activation. Under the conditions of the study, l-borneol was considered non-clastogenic. ANIMAL STUDIES: As with camphor, laboratory animals appear to be much less susceptible to borneol toxicity than man. Borneol increased the activity of CYP2D in rats orally treated by borneol for 7 days. Borneol has been evaluated for antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities in mice. Borneol produced a significant reduction of the nociceptive behavior at the early and late phases of paw licking and reduced the writhing reflex in mice. When the hot plate test was conducted, borneol (in higher dose) produced an inhibition of the nociceptive behavior. Additionally, borneol-treated mice had reduced the carrageenan-induced leukocytes migration to the peritoneal cavity. The mutagenic potential of borneol was assessed in an Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100 treated with borneol at concentrations up to 5000 ug/ plate in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Other studies confirming a lack of mutagenic potential in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 have been published. Under the conditions of the study, borneol is considered not mutagenic in bacteria.",

It is also used in perfumery and in preparation of chemical esters.HUMAN STUDIES: In a human maximization test, no reactions indicative of sensitization were observed with 10% isoborneol in petrolatum. Isoborneol did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity at concentrations ranging between 0.016% and 0.08% when tested against human cell lines. ANIMAL STUDIES: Isoborneol did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity at concentrations ranging between 0.016% and 0.08% when tested against monkey cell lines. Read across chemicals l-borneol and isobornyl acetate were evaluated for genotoxicity, repeated dose toxicity, developmental and reproductive toxicity. In the13-week subchronic toxicity study for isobornyl acetate conducted in rats the NOEL was determined to be 15 mg/kg/day, based on increased urinary cell excretion.The NOAEL for reproductive toxicity in the parental generation was determined to be 300 mg/kg/day for isobornyl acetate. l-borneol was not mutagenic in the Ames test. Isoborneol, was assessed for genotoxic potential in the Bluescreen assay and was found negative for genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.",

Six compounds, namely rhodamine B, sodium-fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dextrans of 4, 10, 20 and 40 kDa were selected as model drugs. Permeation studies were performed using excised cornea of rabbits by a Franz-type diffusion apparatus. The safety of borneol was assessed on the basis of corneal hydration level and Draize eye test. The application of 0.2% borneol to the cornea increased the apparent permeability coefficient by 1.82-(p<0.05), 2.49-(p<0.05), 4.18-(p<0.05), and 1.11-fold (not significant) for rhodamine B, sodium-fluorescein, FITC-dextrans of 4 and 10 kDa, respectively. No significant permeability enhancement of FITC dextrans of 10, 20 and 40 kDa with borneol was found compared to control. The permeability coefficient enhanced by 0.2% borneol was linear correlated to the molecular weight of model drugs (R(2)=0.9976). With the 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% borneol application, the corneal hydration values were <83% and Draize scores were <4. Borneol may improve the transcorneal penetration of both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds without causing toxic reactions, especially hydrophilic ones. Furthermore, 0.2% borneol can enhance the permeation of hydrophilic compounds with molecular weight </= 4 kDa. Hence, borneol can be considered as a safe and effective penetration enhancer for ocular drug administration.",

Our results demonstrated that NB effectively synergized with Cur to enhance its antiproliferative activity on A375 human melanoma cells by induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by an increase in sub-G1 cell population, DNA fragmentation, PARP cleavage, and caspase activation. Further mechanistic studies by Western blotting showed that after treatment of the cells with NB/Cur, up-regulation of the expression level of phosphorylated JNK and down-regulation of the expression level of phosphorylated ERK and Akt contributed to A375 cells apoptosis. Moreover, NB also potentiated Cur to trigger intracellular ROS overproduction and the DNA damage with up-regulation of the expression level of phosphorylated ATM, phosphorylated Brca1 and phosphorylated p53. The results indicate the combinational application potential of NB and Cur in treatments of cancers.",

(+/-) Isoborneol is a monoterpenoid alcohol present in the essential oils of numerous medicinal plants and is a known antioxidant. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of isoborneol against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cell death in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with isoborneol significantly reduced 6-OHDA-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 6-OHDA-induced increases in intracellular calcium. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by 6-OHDA was reversed by isoborneol treatment. Isoborneol protected against 6-OHDA-induced increases in caspase-3 activity and cytochrome C translocation into the cytosol from mitochondria. Isoborneol prevented 6-OHDA from decreasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. We also observed that isoborneol decreased the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and induced activation of protein kinase C (PKC) which had been suppressed by 6-OHDA. Our results indicate that the protective function of isoborneol is dependent upon its antioxidant potential and strongly suggest that isoborneol may be an effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress.",

In the human maximization test, two reactions were observed in a panel of 25 subjects to l-borneol; however these were considered questionable due to the presence of concurrent test materials for which numerous strong reactions were observed. The human maximization test was repeated, utilizing the same concentration; no reactions (0/25) indicative of sensitization were observed to l-borneol. In another human maximization test, no reactions indicative of sensitization were observed with 8% l-borneol in petrolatum. /l-Borneol/",

Some natural compounds, including borneol, shed promising light on AD treatment. The present study was designed to investigate the antioxidative, antiapoptotic effects, and neuroprotection of borneol in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). Oxidative stress was induced by administering 50 uM Abeta into SH-SY5Y cells. Neuroprotective effect of commercially available borneol was examined by determining cell viability with the MTT assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured using a fluorometer with further examination of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression. Apoptosis was examined by measuring the ratio of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). Our data indicated that Abeta-induced cell cytotoxicity was inhibited by 100 uM of (-) and (+) borneol treatment. Treatment of borneol significantly decreased ROS generation (p<0.01). The expression of HO-1 and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 were increased by Abeta treatment. This nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was further increased by administration of borneol. Compared with the Abeta treated group, the (+) borneol treated group significantly increased Bcl-2 expression with decreased expression of Bax. Borneol protected SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta-induced toxicity, exerted an antioxidative effect and suppressed apoptosis. It increases our knowledge about neuroprotective mechanism of borneol, and it is hopeful to be a candidate compound for developing therapeutic drug for the prevention and treatment of AD and other Abeta-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, due to its poor solubility and hence poor absorption, Cur has limited clinical applications. It is therefore important to develop an effective method to improve its absorption. Natural borneol (NB), a terpene and bicyclic organic compound, has been extensively used as a food additive, and our previous studies show that it can improve the uptake of Cur in cancer cells. However, the anticancer mechanism of NB/Cur remains unclear. In this study, the effects of NB/Cur on HepG2 cells were investigated by proteomic analysis. The results showed that 32 differentially expressed proteins identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were significantly changed after NB/Cur treated HepG2 cells for 24 h. Moreover, 17 proteins increased and 12 proteins decreased significantly. Biological progress categorization demonstrated that the identified proteins were mainly associated with cell cycle and apoptosis (28.1%). Subcellular location categorization exhibited that the identified proteins were mainly located in nucleus (28.1%) and mitochondrion (21.9%). Among of all proteins, we selected three differential proteins (hnRNPC1/C2, NPM, and PSMA5), which were associated with the p53 pathway. Down-regulation of hnRNPC1/C2 and NPM contributed to the enhancement of phosphorylated p53. Activated p53 and down-regulation of PSMA5 resulted in an increase in p21 protein. Further studies showed that NB/Cur induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, indicating that ROS might be upstream of the G2/M arrest signaling pathway. In summary, the results exhibited the whole proteomic response of HepG2 cells to NB/Cur, which might lead to a better understanding of its underlying anticancer mechanisms.",

A significant, non-dose-dependent increase in micronucleated binucleated (MNBN) cells was increased compared to vehicle control in the non-S9-activated 4 hr exposure group at doses of 100 and 400 mg/mL. However, the percentage of MNBN cells was within the historical solvent control range; this increase was not considered biologically relevant. Under the conditions of the study, l-borneol was concluded to be negative for the induction of micronuclei in the micronucleus test. /l-borneol/",

In the past few years, many studies showed that borneol can improve the bioavailability of other drugs, promoting drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier, so the potential drug interactions between borneol and other medicines have attracted great attention, but the influence of borneol to CYP450 and its isoforms are rarely reported. In this research, male Wistar rats were orally administered by borneol for 7 days, then the mRNA and protein expression and the activities of CYP2D were detected, we also compared the pharmacokinetic parameters of CYP2D's specific substrate between control group and borneol group. The results show that borneol (33, 100 and 300 mg/kg/d) have no significant effect on CYP2D, while the activites of CYP2D increased 1.71, 1.97 and 2.89 times comparing to the control group. At the same time, borneol (300 mg/kg/d) caused the C(max) decreased 10.6% (p>0.05), AUC(0-8) decreased 27.5% (p<0.01), CL/F increased 41.1% (p<0.01), V(z)/F increased 23.1% (p>0.05) of dextromethorphan. Our data provided that borneol speed up dextromethorphan's elimination in vivo. Since the activity of CYP2D can be induced by borneol, the metabolic interactions might happen when borneol and the substrate drug CYP2D are used together.",

Borneol is a constituent of various plants, plant tissues, and many plant essential oils. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.02X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates borneol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase borneol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.4 days. Borneol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, borneol is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 76. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.38X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Borneol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 97% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, borneol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.2 days and 29 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 30 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to borneol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where borneol is produced or used. Limited monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to borneol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing borneol.

Its previous use as an insecticide may have resulted in its direct release to the environment. Isoborneol is a constituent of various plant parts, tissues, and essential oils of a variety of plant species. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.5X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isoborneol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase isoborneol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 34 hours. Isoborneol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isoborneol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.7X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Isoborneol has an estimated vapor pressure of 3.5X10-2 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, isoborneol may volatilize from dry soil. Based on analogy to borneol, isoborneol is expected to biodegrade rapidly. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 97% of the Theoretical BOD was reached for borneol, in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, isoborneol may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 days and 54 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 64 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to isoborneol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isoborneol is produced or used. Limited monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to isoborneol via ingestion of food and dermal contact with plant essential oils and consumer products containing isoborneol.

Vapor-phase borneol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.4 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.14X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Borneol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Volatilization of isoborneol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.7X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Isoborneol has an estimated vapor pressure of 3.5X10-2 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3) and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, isoborneol may volatilize from dry soil(SRC). Based on analogy to borneol, isoborneol is expected to biodegrade rapidly. Borneol reached 97% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(5) which suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.7X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 days and 54 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 64(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Based on analogy to borneol, isoborneol is expected to biodegrade rapidly. Borneol reached 97% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(7) which suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

After 4 weeks of treatment with methapyrilene, rats also excrete detectable amounts of the 3- and (6-hydroxylpyridyl)-methapyrilene metabolites suggesting that pretreatment with methapyrilene alters the metabolism of the pyridine ring. Metabolic removal of the 2-thienylmethylene moiety is also facile, as large amounts of N'-(2-pyridyl)-N,N-dimethylethylenediamine and its metabolite N'-(2(5-hydroxylpyridyl))-N,N-dimethylethylenediamine are excreted under all dosing regimens.

Liver microsomes were prepared from both control and treated rats. After incubation with 1 mM methapyrilene, eight metabolites were detected and six were quantitated. Five of the metabolites have been previously identified as 2-hydroxymethyl-thiophene, thiophene-2-carboxylic acid, N-(2-thienylmethyl)-2-aminopyridine, N-2-pyridyl-N'N'-dimethylethylenediamine, and 2-aminopyridine. Three other metabolites have been tentatively identified based on their mass spectral fragmentation patterns as normethapyrilene, (5-hydroxypyridyl)methapyrilene, and methapyrileneamide. The same metabolites were found in both control and treated animals, the most abundant being normethapyrilene and N-2-pyridyl-N'N'-dimethylenethylenediamine. Pretreatment with methapyrilene resulted in inhibition of both consumption of methapyrilene and formation of some metabolites. However increases in the formation of all of the metabolites also occurred under different treatment conditions. In both control and treated tissue, the preliminary mass balance was less than 55%, except in incubations with tissue from rats treated with 1000 ppm for 8 or 16 weeks where it was 92 and 89%, respectively. Dramatic increases in the fraction of N-(2-thienylmethyl)-2-aminopyridine, methapyrileneamide, normethapyrilene and (5-hydroxypyridyl)methapyrilene relative to methapyrilene consumed account for the increase in the mass balance after 8 weeks pretreatment with 1000 ppm methapyrilene, and increases in the amounts of N-2-pyridyl-N'N'-dimethylenediamine, (5-hydroxypyridyl)methapyrilene and thiophene-2-carboxylic acid account for the higher mass balance after 16 weeks.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Amines are chemical bases. They neutralize acids to form salts plus water. These acid-base reactions are exothermic. The amount of heat that is evolved per mole of amine in a neutralization is largely independent of the strength of the amine as a base. Amines may be incompatible with isocyanates, halogenated organics, peroxides, phenols (acidic), epoxides, anhydrides, and acid halides. Flammable gaseous hydrogen is generated by amines in combination with strong reducing agents, such as hydrides.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

The compound may no longer be used as a drug based upon a report that it was being withdrawn due to possible carcinogenicity. If methapyrilene is released to soil, it will be expected to exhibit low mobility in soil based upon an estimated Koc of 737. Methapyrilene, therefore, may very slowly leach through soil to groundwater. Based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.74X10-7 atm-cu m/mole, volatilization of methapyrilene from moist near-surface soil or water should not be significant. It is not known whether methapyrilene biodegrades in soil or natural water. It should not hydrolyze in natural water or moist soil. If released to water, it may be susceptible to direct photolysis in water since the compound absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm. It should not bioconcentrate significantly in aquatic organisms or strongly adsorb to sediment or suspended sediments. If methapyrilene is released to the atmosphere, it will be expected to exist in both the vapor and particulate phases, based upon a vapor pressure of 7.0X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C which was extrapolated from vapor pressure data at higher temperatures. It may be susceptible to direct photolysis in the atmosphere since the compound adsorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm. It should react rapidly with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals based upon an estimated rate constant for this process of 185X10-12 cu cm/molecules-sec at 25 \u00b0C which corresponds to atmospheric half-life of 2.1 hr at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hdyroxyl radicals per cu cm. Exposure to methapyrilene in the past may have been mainly via oral ingestion of medications which contained salts of methapyrilene as antihistamines, although it may no longer be used as a drug. Current exposure may be very limited since no information concerning possible current manufacture or uses were found. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

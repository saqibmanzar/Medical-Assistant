The determination of free and total nomifensine in plasma and urine was performed by HPLC. Nomifensine was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and peak concentration of free nomifensine was reached at 1.13 hr. The elimination half life after single dose was about 4 hr regardless of the route of administration. Nomifensine was extensively distributed in body fluids and tissues, with an apparent volume of distribution of 8.69 L/kg. The AUC of free nomifensine after oral dosing was only 26.5% of that after intravenous infusion. Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract was complete, and the AUCs of total nomifensine were equal after all treatments. The AUC of free nomifensine decreased substantially and the elimination half life was shortened after a 2-wk dosing period. It was concluded that the main reason for limited bioavailability seems to be extensive first-pass metabolism during the absorption process and that a marked induction of the metabolizing enzymes is suggested; therefore, an increase in nomifensine dosage may be needed in some patients to maintain a full therapeutic effect. /Nomifensine maleate/",

The clearance of radioactivity of (14)C-nomifensine from the plasma of pregnant and non-pregnant rats was similar and was complex with secondary peaks and plateaux after both oral and intravenous dosing. Maximum plasma levels (mean +/- S.D., 0.20 +/- 0.05 and 0.22 +/- 0.02 ug equivalents nomifensine/mL plasma for pregnant and non-pregnant rats respectively) occurred at 30 to 45 min after oral dosing. The biological half-life of radioactivity in plasma was between 4 and 5 hr for both routes of administration, although there was an additional rapid initial phase (half life approx. 20 min) after intravenous dosing. Whole body autoradiography also showed a very similar tissue distribution pattern of radioactivity between pregnant and non-pregnant rats with extensive distribution from blood into tissue. Only traces of radioactivity from (14)C-nomifensine were seen to cross the placenta into the fetuses of 15-day pregnant rats and these rapidly cleared with time. Slightly higher amounts were seen to cross the fetuses of 18-day pregnant rats and radioactivity was seen in the fetal brain, heart, liver and lung. Quantitative tissue distribution studies confirmed these qualitative findings. The biological half-life of radioactivity in both adult and fetal tissues was approximately 5 hr, except for adult livers where a longer half-life of radioactivity of approximately 10 hr was found.",

The elimination half-life was 6 hr and only very small amounts were found in blood at 24 hr after administration. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) was 120-149 1, suggesting an extensive distribution of the drug throughout body fluids and tissues. The area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) obtained after oral administration was significantly smaller than that after intravenous administration indicating incomplete bioavailability of the drug in oral form. The conjugation of nomifensine after the two different administration routes was also studied: the conjugation reaction was in equilibrium at 15 min after oral administration, while after intravenous administration, equilibrium was not reached until 1-1.5 hr. The metabolism of nomifensine occurred in the gastrointestinal membranes and or in the liver during the absorption process; the first-pass effect was marked.",

The determination of the 3 main metabolites of nomifensine maleate in plasma and urine was performed by HPLC. The 3 principal metabolites reached maximum plasma concentrations rapidly (1-1.5 hr), less than 10% as a free, unconjugated form and were eliminated rapidly (elimination half life between 6.8 and 9.0 hr). Only very low concentrations of free metabolites were found in plasma after 24 hr. Two wk of dosing had no significant influence on the elimination of half life or AUC values of the metabolites, indicating no change in the hydroxylation and methylation reactions and there were no changes in the conjugation reactions. Nomifensine had a very short half life and no tendency for accumulation after repeated doses. It was concluded that the clinical pharmacokinetic profile of nomifensine maleate is not significantly changed by the kinetic behavior of its 3 main metabolites after the usual maintenance doses. /Nomifensine maleate/",

Human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH generated the dihydroisoquinolinium ion metabolite along with other hydroxylated metabolites, whereas when supplemented with t-butyl peroxide, only the dihydroisoquinolinium ion metabolite was observed. Monoamine oxidase A, but not monoamine oxidase B, catalyzed this reaction, as well as human hemoglobin supplemented with H2O2. Human myeloperoxidase catalyzed this reaction in the presence of H2O2, and activation of the reaction was observed when incubations were conducted in the presence of acetaminophen at concentrations relevant to those measured in humans. The reaction was also observed in human whole blood. The equilibrium between the dihydroisoquinolinium ion and carbinolamine was shown to have a pK of about 11.7.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Nomifensine is more than 20 times as potent as imipramine, and equipotent to desipramine, in inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine. In electrophysiologic studies nomifensine is four times as active, within the locus coeruleus (a major noradrenergic brain nucleus), as desipramine, and nomifensine is 20 times as potent as imipramine with this test system. In accord with such activity, chronic treatment with nomifensine leads to a reduction in the sensitivity of postsynaptic beta-noradrenergic receptors.",

Nomifensine is a weak inhibitor of serotonin reuptake into rat brain synaptosomes, and is 1/300 times as potent as imipramine, and equipotent to desipramine, in this regard. This is confirmed in electrophysiologic studies where nomifensine has extremely weak, although not absent, activity within the dorsal raphe. However, while nomifensine appears to be inactive in serotonergic systems it has some binding affinity for serotonergic receptors; it is as avid as imipramine for the 5-HT 1 receptor, but is less than 1/100 as avid as imipramine for the 5-HT 2 receptor.",

However, among our patients we have seen 2 typical cases of drug fever due to nomifensine. 2-4 weeks after start of nomifensine treatment, 75-150 mg/day, for recurrent endogenous depressions the patients developed shiverings and fever. Nomifensine was withdrawn and both became afebrile within 1 day. A provocation test with 50 mg nomifensine p.o. again resulted in shiverings and fever within 6-8 hr 1 of the patients was allergic to other drugs and suffered from asthma. During the acute episode of illness the serum concentration of alanine aminotransferase was elevated and it normalized after stopping the treatment. A liver biopsy at that time showed liver cell necrosis, and a moderate grade of steatosis and fibrosis was also present. The results indicate that nomifensine may cause drug fever. It is possible that patients with allergy and/or liver diseases in particular may be susceptible to drug fever due to nomifensine.",

No deaths occurred in 6 rabbits treated with mianserin, but 3 of 8 rabbits given maprotiline and one of 8 rabbits given nomifensine did die. Cardiac output values were lowered only in the mianserin group, while renal blood flow was reduced by 35.8, 46.8 and 28% for maprotiline, mianserin and nomifensine, respectively. Left ventricular pressure and mean arterial pressure fell significantly in the maprotiline and mianserin groups. All rabbits demonstrated ventricular and supraventricular extrasystoles, but QRS widening and right bundle branch block were observed only for maprotiline and mianserin. Severe seizures with hypocapnia and metabolic acidosis were seen in nomifensine rabbits. It was concluded that nomifensine causes much less cardiotoxicity at the dosage studied, but severe motor convulsions were induced.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

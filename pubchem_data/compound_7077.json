It is a H1 receptor blocker and a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistaminergic drugs. It is available in combination products that also contain other analgesics and antitussives such as acetaminophen. Phenyltoloxamine citrate is the more common salt form that acts as an active ingredient in pharmaceutical products and promotes hay fever relief via reversing the effects of histamine. Phenyltoloxamine acts as an adjuvant analgesic, which augments the analgesic effect of acetaminophen. It also potentiates the effects of other drugs, such as codeine and codeine derivatives.  Although phenyltoloxamine's ability to potentiate the effects of analgesics may be explained in part by its chemical nature as a first-generation H1 antihistamine that is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and causing tranquilizing effects at CNS histamine receptors, many of the drug's specific pharmacokinetics are not readily available - perhaps also because many early (phenyltoloxamine was involved in studies as early as the 1950s) first-generation antihistamines were not optimally investigated. Nevertheless, phenyltoloxamine is used to a fairly limited extent in contemporary medicine, with only very few products involving it as an active ingredient.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Reduction of the activity of the NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) immune response transcription factor via the phospholipase C and phosphatidylinositol (PIP2) signaling pathways also serves to decrease antigen presentation and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and chemotactic factors. Moreover, lowering calcium ion concentration leads to increased mast cell stability which reduces further histamine release.  Additionally, first-generation antihistamines like phenyltoloxamine readily cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation and other adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects, like nervousness and insomnia. By comparison, second-generation antihistamines are more selective for H1 receptors in the peripheral nervous system and do not cross the blood-brain barrier, resulting in fewer adverse drug effects overall.  Furthermore, although some studies propose that phenyltoloxamine may possess some intrinsic antispasmodic and distinct local anesthetic properties, the specific mechanisms of action for these effects have not been formalized. Also, even though the combination of phenyltoloxamine's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause various tranquilizing effects may explain to some extent how it may be able to potentiate analgesic effects, there are also studies that observed no potentiating effects associated with phenyltoloxamine use either.",

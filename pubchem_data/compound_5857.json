ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The highest concentrations were found in the liver, while there was lower activity in the fatty tissues and the activity in the fetuses was comparable with that in the brain. The placental transfer was verified by the results of liquid scintillation counting. The concentration of labelled substance in the fetuses increased with the duration of pregnancy.",

After the administration of norethindrone, the peak level of norethindrone in the plasma was obtained within 2 hours, and the peak concentration in the plasma was about 3.5 ng/mL/mg norethindrone. During a period of 2-6 hours after the administration of norethindrone, the half-life of norethindrone in the plasma was approximately 1.8 hours, and during the period of 6-24 hours, half-life was variable. On the other hand, after lynestrenol administration, the peak level of norethindrone in the plasma was obtained within 4 hours, and the peak concentration of norethindrone was about 1.9 ng/mL/mg lynestrenol. During a period of 4-12 hours, the half-life of norethindrone was about 2.5 hours. The peak of norethindrone level after lynestrenol administration was lower and appeared later than that after administration of the same dose of norethindrone. Norethindrone in plasma in subjects receiving lynestrenol could be measured for a longer period than in those receiving the same dose of norethindrone. These results suggest that lynestrenol is stored in fat tissue and is slowly metabolized to norethindrone.",

There was a decrease of the peak values and an increase of half-life of NET during the periovulatory and luteal phase which was, however, not significant due to the great individual differences. The shift of the peak time to longer intervals and the increase of half-life of NET after ingestion of higher LYN doses indicate a certain limitation of the metabolic capacity of the liver. ...",

Eleven normal males were administer either 1 capsule containing 2.5 mg lynestrenol and 0.05 mg ethynylestradiol or tablets containing the same dose of steroids. Blood samples were taken just before and 1,2,4,8, and 24 hours after the drugs were administered. 8 days later the subjects were given the opposite formulations and blood samples were again obtained at the same time intervals. Radioimmunoassay was used to assess levels of free and conjugated ethynylestradiol and norethisterone in the serum samples. Biovailability assessments were made by calculating the areas under the time-concentration curves. Results demonstrated that the conversion of lynestrenol to norethisterone in vivo was complete. Unconjugated ethynylestradiol mean values, 2 and 4 hours after administration of the drugs, were higher for capsules than for tablets. For blood samples taken at other time periods the mean values of unconjugated ethynylestradiol were similar for both capsules and tablets. For conjugated ethynylestradiol the mean values and the areas under the curve, for blood samples obtained at each time interval, showed no significant difference for tablets and capsules.",

Both levonorgestrel and norethindrone undergo extensive reduction of the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone in ring A. Levonorgestrel also undergoes hydroxylation at carbons 2 and 16. The metabolites of both compounds circulate predominantly as sulfates. In urine, levonorgestrel metabolites are found primarily in the glucuronide form, whereas norethindrone metabolites are present in approximately equal amounts as sulfates and glucuronides. Of the progestogens structurally related to norethindrone, norethindrone acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, norethindrone enanthate, and perhaps lynestrenol, undergo rapid hydrolysis and are converted to the parent compound and its metabolites. There is no convincing evidence that norethynodrel is converted to norethindrone. Of the progestogens structurally related to levonorgestrel, it appears that neither desogestrel nor gestodene are transformed to the parent compound. However, there is evidence that norgestimate can be, at least partly, converted to levonorgestrel. ...",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

During treatment of a characteristic, monomorphic microscopical endometrium picture was observed with hardly distinct endometrium glands and only slight decidualike transformation of cellular elements of the stroma.

Blood samples were taken in the morning and plasma was immediately separated. Results showed that body temperature varied unpredictably during the cycle, and therefore could not be considered a reliable parameter of ovulation. 0.35 mg of Lynestrenol administered daily was enough to suppress ovulation, as evidenced by the absence of LH during midcycle. Although differences exists in individual reactions, administration of Lynestrenol beyond 0.6 mg. daily always suppresses ovulation because of hypothalamo-pituitary inhibition, while doses below 0.5mg. daily can bring about episodic peaks. It is still not clear how Lynestrenol influences gonadotropins, especially LH, while intermittent bleeding seems to be the only sure side effect.",

Hepatocellular adenomas were studied by immunohistochemistry for estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors (ER, PR and AR respectively), and for beta-catenin. Direct sequencing of the HNF-1alpha gene was also performed. ...  /Investigators/ demonstrate significant immunostaining of AR in the hepatocellular adenomas. This staining was negative in the partially regressive adenoma. Immunostainings for ER and PR were negative.

The patient was subjected to hormonal linestrenol therapy, which she had administered herself, without further consultations with her gynecologist, during the previous 10 years. Complete diagnostic examinations were performed. Contrast sonohysterography enabled the visualization of multiple polyps inside the uterine cavity, which were confirmed by histopathological analysis of material obtained via explorative curettage. Histopathological material contained over 30 endometrial polyps. A control check-up after one month, as well as subsequent quarterly check-ups, resulted in normal findings. Analysis of the described case has indicated that the loss of sensitivity of progesterone receptors in endometrial cells is possible if there is a continuous presence of progesterone agonists in circulation, as is true of linestrenol in this case. The loss of sensitivity of progesterone receptors upsets normal hormonal activity during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, leading to copious, irregular bleeding. ...",

The diagnosis was based on the characteristic urinary coproporphyrin and fecal protoporphyrin excretion patterns, and the specific peak of plasma fluorescence at 626 nm in spectrofluorometry. Biochemical analysis revealed that most of the family members, though free of clinical symptoms, excrete porphyrin metabolites in urine and stool similar to variegate porphyria, accompanied by a significant decrease of porphobilinogen deaminase activity of a range which is ordinarily found in patients with acute intermittent porphyria only (approximately 50%). These data first led to the assumption of two separate and independently inherited genetic defects, similar to the dual porphyria of Chester. Molecular analysis, however, revealed only a missense mutation of the protoporphyrinogen oxidase gene, but not of the porphobilinogen deaminase gene. Thus, in the family presented, porphobilinogen deaminase deficiency is likely to be a phenomenon secondary to the genetic defect of protoporphyrinogen oxidase.",

In both experiments, the rats were caged with a mate overnight and if, on the following morning, spermatozoa were found on the vaginal smear, that day became Day 1 of pregnancy. In Experiment 1, the test group (15) received .1 mg lynestrenol sc and the control group (14) 1 mL propyleneglycol on Days 2, 3, 4, and 5 of pregnancy. Experiment 2 differed in that the rats received 1 mg dosages of lynestrenol. On Day 7 of pregnancy, Experiment 1 rats were killed and their ovaries and genital tracts were examined. In Experiment 2, the rats were permitted to live until Day 23 to see if they would achieve full-term pregnancy. If delivery did not occur, they were killed (Day 25) and examined for fetuses. In Experiment 1, the dose did not significantly increase the number of lost ova (20% in controls), as indicated by the implanted embryos/recent corpora lutea ratio counted on Day 7. There was an increase in the number of ciliated cells in the epithelium and a diminution of the deciduoid tissue of the stroma. No histological changes were seen in the ovaries, embyros, or uteri. The 1 mg dosage of lynestrenol prevented pregnancy in all of the rats. Doses were smaller than those needed to inhibit ovulation, and the time of administration of the doses excluded any action on sperm transport, capacitation, or penetration. Lynestrenol would appear to act on the pregnant rat's genital tract, as oviducts displayed evidence of estrogen stimulation.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

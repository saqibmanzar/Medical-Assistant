Initially introduced in 1983 in Japan as treatment for neurological conditions such as anxiety and sleep disorders, etizolam is marketed in Japan, Italy and India.

This new class is easily oxidized, rapidly metabolized, and has a lower risk of accumulation, even after prolonged treatment. Etizolam has an anxiolytic action about 6 times greater than that of diazepam. Etizolam produces, especially at higher dosages, a reduction in time taken to fall asleep, an increase in total sleep time and a reduction in the number of awakenings. During tests there were not substantial changes in deep sleep. There is a reduction of REM sleep. In EEG tests of healthy volunteers Etizolam showed some characteristics of tricyclic antidepressants. Etizolam (marketed under the brand name Etilaam, Etizola, Sedekopan, Pasaden or Depas) is a thienodiazepine drug which is a benzodiazepine analog. The etizolam molecule differs from a benzodiazepine in that the benzene ring has been replaced by a thiophene ring. It possesses amnesic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It acts on the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor as an agonist to increase inhibitory GABAergic transmission throughout the central nervous system. Studies indicate that etizolam mediates its pharmacological actions with 6 to 10 times more potency than that of diazepam. Clinical human studies performed in Italy showed clinical effectiveness of etizolam in relieving symptoms in patients with generalized anxiety disorders with depressive symptoms. Etizolam also mediates imipramine-like neuropharmacological and behavioral effects, as well as minor effects on cognitive functioning. It is shown to substitute the actions of a short-acting barbiturate, pentobarbitol, in a drug discrimination study.  Etizolam is an antagonist at platelet-activating-factor (PAF) receptor and attenuates the recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma after neurosurgery in clinical studies. It is shown to inhibit PAF-induced bronchoconstriction and hypotension.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

It is reported to bind to the benzodiazepine binding site which is located across the interface between the alpha and gamma subunits. Benzodiazapines are reported to only bind to receptors that contain gamma 2 and alpha 1/2/3/5 subunits. Alpha-1-containing receptors mediate the sedative effects of etizolam whereas alpha-2 and alpha-3 subunit-containing receptors mediate the anxiolytic effect. Etizolam shows high potency and affinity towards GABA-A receptor with alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2S subunit combination. By binding to the regulatory site of the receptor, etizolam potentiates GABA transmission by facilitating the opening of GABA-induced chloride channels. Etizolam is a specific antagonist at PAFR. It inhibits PAF-induced platelet aggregation by inhibiting PAF binding to the receptors located on the surface of platelets with an IC50 of 22nM.",

Hypotension may be combated by the use of norepinephrine or metaraminol. Dialysis is of limited value. Flumazenil (Anexate) is a competitive benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that can be used as an antidote for benzodiazepine overdose. In particular, flumazenil is very effective at reversing the CNS depression associated with benzodiazepines but is less effective at reversing respiratory depression. Its use, however, is controversial as it has numerous contraindications. It is contraindicated in patients who are on long-term benzodiazepines, those who have ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold, or in patients who have tachycardia or a history of seizures. As a general rule, medical observation and supportive care are the mainstay of treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Although benzodiazepines are absorbed by activated charcoal, gastric decontamination with activated charcoal is not beneficial in pure benzodiazepine overdose as the risk of adverse effects often outweigh any potential benefit from the procedure. It is recommended only if benzodiazepines have been taken in combination with other drugs that may benefit from decontamination. Gastric lavage (stomach pumping) or whole bowel irrigation are also not recommended.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

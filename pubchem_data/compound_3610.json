When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

As an antiseptic agent, studies have demonstrated that hexylresorcinol is capable of eliciting actions like reducing or inhibiting the generation of bacterial biofilm, interfering with bacterial cell chain formation, reducing bacterial adherence of the pharynx, inhibition of glycolytic enzyme and pH drops, and alteration of cell surface hydrophobicity. Unfortunately, there are either antibiotics that function even more effectively at formally treating bacterial growth or there are also other plant-derived phenolic compounds similar to hexylresorcinol that elicit stronger such mechanisms of action. Nevertheless, it is useful for hexylresorcinol to have both anesthetic and certain antiseptic actions for its use in treating various relatively self-limiting scrapes and sore throats that are treated by the over-the-counter products that feature the compound. Early studies in the 1930s and 1940s suggested that there were more effective medicines over hexylresorcinol that could be employed for their anthelmintic effects.  As an anti-inflammatory and anti-aging agent, some studies have shown that it may be possible for hexylresorcinol to inhibit the phosphorylation of the immune response mediator NF-kappaB and also elicit a significant skin lightening effect owing to a strong inhibitory effect on tyrosinase and peroxidase and a stimulatory effect on glutathione and E-cadherin syntheses. It is proposed that hexylresorcinol can bind to tyrosinase directly and inhibits its enzyme activity. Literature data suggests that low glutathione levels relates to the deposition of melanin in the skin of humans and other animals, while high glutathione levels inhibit melanogenesis. And ultimately, it is also reported that glutathione depletion increases tyrosinase activity in human melanoma cells, which makes hexylresorcinol's effects on tyrosinase desirable.  Finally, there are ongoing studies that have reported hexylresorcinol's abilities to induce the differentiation of SCC-9 squamous cell cell-line by way of the modulation of the E2F-mediated signaling pathway and suppress the growth of squamous cell carcinoma SCC-9 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, such studies have also shown that hexylresorcinol is seemingly capable of dose-dependent induction of SCC-9 cell apoptosis as well as the inhibition of transglutaminase-2 enzyme activity which can facilitate chemotherapy resistance.",

Watch for signs of respiratory insufficiency and assist ventilations if necessary. Administer oxygen by nonrebreather mask at 10 to 15 L/min. Monitor for pulmonary edema and treat if necessary. Monitor for shock and treat if necessary. Anticipate seizures and treat if necessary. For eye contamination, flush eyes immediately with water. Irrigate each eye continuously with 0.9% saline during transport. Administer activated charcoal. Dilution may be contraindicated because it may increase absorption. Do not use emetics. Cover skin burns with dry, sterile dressings after decontamination. Maintain body temperature. Advanced treatment. Consider orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation for airway control in the patient who is unconscious, has severe pulmonary edema, or is in severe respiratory distress. Positive-pressure ventilation techniques with a bag-valve-mask device may be beneficial. Consider drug therapy for pulmonary edema. Monitor cardiac rhythm and treat arrhythmias if necessary. Start IV administration of D5W TKO. Use 0.9% saline or lactated Ringer's if signs of hypovolemia are present. For hypotension with signs of hypovolemia, administer fluid cautiously. Consider vasopressors if patient is hypotensive with a normal fluid volume. Watch for signs of fluid overload. Administer 1% solution methylene blue if patient is symptomatic with severe hypoxia, cyanosis, and cardiac compromise not responding to oxygen. DIRECT PHYSICIAN ORDER ONLY. Treat seizures with diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam (Ativan). Use proparacaine hydrochloride to assist eye irrigation. /Phenols and related compounds/",

Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2 yr gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of 4-hexylresorcinol for male or female F344/N rats given doses of 62.5 or 125 mg/kg. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of 4-hexylresorcinol for male B6C3F1 mice, as shown by marginally incr incidences of pheochromocytomas (and hyperplasia) of the adrenal medulla and of harderian gland neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for female B6C3F1 mice given doses of 62.5 or 125 mg/kg 4-hexylresorcinol. ...",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.4X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates hexylresorcinol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase hexylresorcinol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours. Particulate-phase hexylresorcinol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Hexylresorcinol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, hexylresorcinol is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,800. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, hexylresorcinol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 90 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to hexylresorcinol is limited but may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hexylresorcinol is produced. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to hexylresorcinol via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing hexylresorcinol. Exposure to the drug among the general population may be via ingestion to those administered the drug (an anthelmintic) and via ingestion of some over-the-counter throat lozenge formulations. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase hexylresorcinol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.1X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase hexylresorcinol may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Hexylresorcinol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

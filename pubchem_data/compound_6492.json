Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The amount of CPD /cyclopentadiene/ produced depends on the feedstock to the cracker. The yield from a naphtha cracker is 6 to 8 times of that from a gas cracker, which uses ethane and propane feed mixture.  The cracked gas leaving the furnace section of a steam cracker contains many chemical components. They are separated by a series of fractionation columns. The bottom stream from the debutanizer column, known as the pyrolysis gasoline in the industry, contains the C5 and heavier fraction of the cracked gas. Typically, cyclopentadiene plus dicyclopentadiene constitute 15-25 wt% of the pyrolysis gasoline. Because CPD dimerizes readily, it is usually recovered in the form of the DCPD.  ... When the pyrolysis gasoline is processed immediately, the amount of DCPD present is small. ... The C5 fraction of the pyrolysis gasoline is first separated as the overhead of a depentanizer. The C5 stream is heat-soaked in a dimerizer at about 100 degC. The CPD in the C5 stream is converted to DCPD. The separation of the low-boiling C5 components from the DCPD is achieved by a second fractionation in which the DCPD is recovered as the bottom product. The DCPD is mainly in the endo form and has a purity of 82-90%.",

The pyrolysis gasoline is first heat-soaked in a dimerizer to convert remaining CPD to DCPD. The effluent from the dimerizer is fractionated in one or more columns where the C5-C9 components are separated from the C10 and heavier fraction. ... The C10 and heavier stream, which contains 50-70% DCPD, is distilled to yield a DCPD overhead product. The purity of the DCPD is 82-95%.",

Two ketone derivatives of dicyclopentadiene were identified by comparison with synthetic standards. Ground water derivatives of dicyclopentadiene were compared with mammalian enzymatic metabolites produced in vitro by incubation with immobilized rabbit liver cytochromes p450. The metabolites were analysed by GC/MS and by GC/MS following derivatization and deuterium labelling.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

DCPD is used in the manufacture of cyclopentadiene as a pesticide intermediate; in the production of ferrocene compounds; in paints, varnishes, and resin manufacture; in production of elastomers, resin systems, and polymers. It is also used as a repellent for animals such as hares, rabbits, and deer, in winter or in summer. Applied in the form of impregnated strip on deciduous and coniferous trees, or by spraying around ornamental plants and shrubs. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Signs of exposure after inhalation--cough, sore throat, and headache; skin exposure--redness and pain; eyes exposure--redness and pain; Ingestion--abdominal pain, and nausea. Human sensory responses to DCPD were studied in three human volunteers. The odor threshold was reported to be as low as 0.003 ppm. In two of the subjects exposed to 1 and 5.5 ppm for 30 minutes, one subject experienced mild eye and throat irritation after 7 minutes at 1 ppm, and the other subject reported olfactory fatigue after 24 minutes. Eye irritation was reported after 10 minutes, but no olfactory fatigue was reported by either test subject at 5.5 ppm. Accidental exposures of workers, in which headaches were experienced during first 2 months but were not experienced during next 3 months, indicate a certain degree of inurement. ANIMAL STUDIES: In rabbits it was slightly irritating to skin and eyes. Three of four rats survived ten 6-hour daily exposures at 250 ppm, and all survived 15 such exposures at 100 ppm. On daily, repeated exposures to DCPD for 10 days, rats succumbed at the 332 ppm level, but not at the 146 and 72 ppm levels. All dying rats succumbed with convulsions and hemorrhage of the lungs with blood in the intestines; with the females, hemorrhage of the thymus. Mice exposed under the same schedule died at both 146 and 72 ppm. After exposures of 7 hours/day for 89 exposure days, kidney damage was seen in rats exposed at 74 and 35 ppm DCPD. Some lung involvement was seen as chronic pneumonia and bronchiectasis, but no dose related effect was seen in other organs examined. Dogs exposed under the same schedule (89 exposure days) at 32, 23, and 9 ppm DCPD showed only minimal changes in the biochemical tests used, and no changes that were dose-related in 28 organs examined. Hyaline droplets in the proximal convoluted tubular epithelial cells of the kidney were seen in male rats exposed to 5 and 50ppm DCPD and tubular proteinosis was seen by week 13 in all male rats exposed to 50ppm DCPD. Mice were exposed to DCPD by inhalation for 7 hours per day, 5 days per week for 10 days at 47, 72, and 146 ppm. All mice exhibited convulsive deaths on the first day of exposure. Death at 72 ppm occurred in five of six mice of each sex during the 10 days of exposure and was not associated with the convulsions or gross lesions observed in rats. No deaths occurred at 47 ppm and no other effects of treatment were observed. In other study four groups, each consisting of 45 male and 45 female B6C3F1 mice, were exposed to DCPD vapor by inhalation 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks (64 exposures) at targeted concentrations of 0, 1.0, 5.0, or 50 ppm. Ten male and nine female mice in the highest exposure group died during the study, while no more than two mice died in any other group. 20 female pregnant rats were admin DCPD orally at 0, 80, 250, 750 mg/kg/day for days 6 to 15 gestation. On day 19, the dams were sacrificed and examined; each uterus was examined for implantation sites, placement in uterine horns, number of live and dead fetuses and resorptions. Fetuses were examined for soft tissue changes and skeletal abnormalities. No compound-related gross pathological effects or changes in reproductive performance were seen in the dams. There were no visceral or skeletal malformations or changes in sex ratio in the fetuses. DCPD was not mutagenic in the Salmonella assay at doses of 0, 3, 10, 33, 100, and 333 ug/plate in Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537) with or without metabolic activation. DCPD did not induce structural chromosomal aberration or polyploidy in CHL/IU cells; negative finding were confirmed in the in vitro micronucleus test.",

A pilot-plant study with alternative disinfectants was carried out with stored water of the Rivers Rhine and Meuse. It was demonstrated that the increase of direct acting mutagens after treatment with chlorine dioxide is similar to the effect of chlorination. Ozonation of Rhine water reduced the mutagenic activity for Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 both with and without metabolic activation. UV alone hardly affects the mutagenicity of the stored river water for S. typhimurium TA 98. In all studies, practically no mutagenic activity for S. typh. TA 100 was found. Although remarkable changes in the concentration of individual organic compounds are reported, the identity of the mutagens detected is yet unclear. Compounds of possible interest due to their removal by ozonation are 1,3,3-trimethyloxindole, dicyclopentadiene and several alkylquinolines. Compounds which might be responsible for the increased mutagenicity after chlorination are two brominated acetonitriles and tri(2-chlorethyl) phosphate. Furthermore, the concentration procedure with adsorption on XAD resin and the subsequent elution step may have affected the results. It is proposed to focus further research more on the less volatile by-products of disinfection than on the trihalomethanes.",

Its use as a repellent for animals such as hares, rabbits, and deer via application of impregnated strip on deciduous and coniferous trees, or by spraying around ornamental plants and shrubs will result in its direct release to the environment. Dicyclopentadiene occurs in crude petroleum and coal tar. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.30 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dicyclopentadiene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dicyclopentadiene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrate radicals; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 3.2 hours, 11 minutes and 39 minutes respectively. Dicyclopentadiene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dicyclopentadiene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1500. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.02 atm-cu m/mole. Dicyclopentadiene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicates that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. Two field studies in Alberta, Canada found degradation rates of 37-57% in 266 days and not appreciable to 60% in 116 days. If released into water, dicyclopentadiene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 4.6 days, respectively. A measured BCF range of 58.9-384 indicates that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. Dicyclopentadiene photoxidizes in natural surface waters exposed to sunlight with a half-life of about 25 days. Occupational exposure to dicyclopentadiene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dicyclopentadiene is produced or used. The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to dicyclopentadiene is by inhalation due to the presence of this substance in gasoline. (SRC)",

Two field studies in Alberta, Canada reported soil biodegradation rates of 37-57% in 266 days and not appreciable to 60% in 116 days(5). A 0% of theoretical BOD as reported using activated sludge in a 2-week Japanese MITI test(6). Although biodegradation of dicyclopentadiene does occur, it is not an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.02 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.30 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 20 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 4.6 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), a measured BCF range of 58.9-384 in carp (Cyprinus carpio)(7) indicates that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high(SRC). A 0% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in a 2-week Japanese MITI test(7) indicates that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Photolysis of dicyclopentadiene in natural groudwater by sunlight was found to reduce the concentration by 50% in about 32 day(8). Dicyclopentadiene is an olefin and olefins in surface waters exposed to sunlight react with photo-oxidants (such as hydroxyl radicals, peroxy radicals and singlet oxygen) with a half-life on the order of 25 days(9).",

Vapor-phase dicyclopentadiene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.2 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.2X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Dicyclopentadiene is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone and nitrate radicals(4). The half-life for the reaction with ozone is estimated to be 11 minutes(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.46X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4). The half-life for the reaction with nitrate radicals is estimated to be 39 minutes(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.2X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4). Dicyclopentadiene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3.2 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of dicyclopentadiene with atmospheric ozone has been measured as 1.46X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(2); this corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 11 minutes at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of dicyclopentadiene with atmospheric nitrate radicals has been measured as 1.2X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(2); this corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 39 minutes(SRC) at an atmospheric concentration of 2.5X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(3). Dicyclopentadiene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Using OECD Method TG 111, dicyclopentadiene was found to be stable in water at 25 \u00b0C for 5 days(5). Dicyclopentadiene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(5). Photolysis of dicyclopentadiene in natural groudwater by sunlight was found to reduce the concentration by 50% in about 32 day(6). Dicyclopentadiene is an olefin and olefins in surface waters exposed to sunlight react with photo-oxidants (such as hydroxyl radicals, peroxy radicals and singlet oxygen) with a half-life on the order of 25 days(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

It is used on cats, dogs, human body and clothing, horses and pet living/sleeping quarters. HUMAN STUDIES: Dipropyl isocinchomeronate is a probable human carcinogen. ANIMAL STUDIES: Dipropyl isocinchomeronate was fed in diet to mice at 0, 125, 250, 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks. Both sexes showed increased relative liver and brain weights. Males showed decreased kidney weights. In rats fed for 104 weeks, increased incidence in hepatocellular and renal cell adenomas and carcinomas, uterine polyps and testicular interstitial cell tumors were observed at 1000 mg/kg. In mice fed for 80 weeks, hepatocellular adenomas (females) and carcinomas in both sexes and alveolar bronchiolar adenomas (males) were observed at 2000 mg/kg. In rat developmental studies, reduced body weight in both sexes at 1000 mg/kg and mild proliferation of portal bile ducts with increased incidence of trace mononuclear cell infiltrate in the portal areas was observed in F0 females and both sexes of F1 at 1000 mg/kg/day. Dipropyl isocinchomeronate was negative for genotoxicity in Salmonella strains TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100 with and without metabolic activation.",

Commonly used spray and aerosol application of insect repellents containing dipropyl isocinchomeronate will release the compound directly to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.92X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dipropyl isocinchomeronate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dipropyl isocinchomeronate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.5 days. Particulate-phase dipropyl isocinchomeronate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Dipropyl isocinchomeronate is decomposed by sunlight. If released to soil, dipropyl isocinchomeronate is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 168. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.1X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Dipropyl isocinchomeronate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Dipropyl isocinchomeronate is expected to hydrolyze in moist neutral and alkaline soils. Photodegradation may occur on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight. If released into water, dipropyl isocinchomeronate may adsorb moderately to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Dipropyl isocinchomeronate hydrolyzed to pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid during the Japanese MITI biodegradation test. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 100 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Dipropyl isocinchomeronate is stable to hydrolysis at pH 5, however, it does hydrolyze in neutral (pH 7) and alkaline (pH 9) water with half-lives of 17 days and 14 hours, respectively. Occupational exposure to dipropyl isocinchomeronate may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dipropyl isocinchomeronate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dipropyl isocinchomeronate via dermal contact with consumer products (insect repellents) containing dipropyl isocinchomeronate. (SRC)",

Dipropyl isocinchomeronate is never used as the sole active ingredient, and is commonly formulated with DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) and other active insect repellent ingredients(1). Dipropyl isocinchomeronate improves the performance of DEET by slowing its evaporation and doing a better job of repelling various insects such as horse flies, stable flies and specific mosquitoes(2). Personal repellent products are washed off the human body and released in household wastewater into a treatment plant(1). Similarly, those products that are used as surface sprays of animal premises and pet dips would be discharged as wastewater, often to septic systems or sewage treatment plants(1).",

Vapor-phase dipropyl isocinchomeronate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.5 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.3X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase dipropyl isocinchomeronate may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Dipropyl isocinchomeronate is decomposed by sunlight(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It includes the likely routes of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, skin and eye contact), and the delayed, immediate, or chronic effects/symptoms from short- and long-term exposure, and the numerical measures of toxicity [e.g., acute toxicity estimates such as the LD50 (median lethal dose, the estimated amount of a chemical expected to kill 50% of test animals in a single dose)].  This section also includes information on whether the chemical is considered as a potential carcinogen according to authoritative sources such as the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens and the International agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

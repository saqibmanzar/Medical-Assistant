When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

It is calculated as the sum of the mass of each constituent atom multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula.  The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Epidermal membranes were set up in glass diffusion cells and, following an initial determination of permeability to tritiated water, excess undiluted glycol ether was applied to the outer surface for 8 hr. The appearance of glycol ether in an aqueous receptor phase bathing the underside of the epidermis was quantified by a gas chromatographic technique. A final determination of tritiated water permeability was compared with initial values to establish any irreversible alterations in epidermal barrier function induced by contact with the glycol ethers. 2-methoxyethanol (EM) was most readily absorbed (mean steady rate 2.82 mg/sq cm/hr), and a relatively high absorption rate (1.17 mg/sq cm/hr) was also apparent for 1-methoxypropan-2-ol (PM). There was a trend of reducing absorption rate with increasing molecular weight or reducing volatility for monoethylene glycol ethers (EM, 2.82 mg/sq cm/hr; 2-ethoxyethanol, EE, 0.796 mg/sq cm/hr; 2-butoxyethanol, EB, 0.198 mg/sq cm/hr) and also within the diethylene glycol series: 2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethanol (DM, 0.206 mg/sq cm/hr); 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy) ethanol (DE, 0.125 mg/sq cm/hr) and 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol (DB, 0.035 mg/sq cm/hr). The rate of absorption of 2-ethoxyethyl acetate (EEAc) was similar to that of the parent alcohol, EE. Absorption rates of diethylene glycol ethers were slower than their corresponding monoethylene glycol equivalents. Combination of intrinsic toxicity and ability to pass across skin contribute to assessment of hazards of contact with undiluted glycol ethers.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Task 1 (dose-range finding) was performed using eight male & 8 female Swiss CD-l mice (8 wks of age)/dose group, which were given 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 & 5.0% DGMEE in their drinking water (deionized/filtered) for 14 days. During the 14-day exposure, one male in the 5.0% DGMEE group exhibited dehydration on days 8-10 & exhibited dehydration & tremors prior to death on day 11. The % weight gain for the sexes combined was significantly reduced in the 4.0% DGMEE group relative to the 0.0, 1.0 & 2.0% DGMEE groups & in the 5.0% DGMEE group relative to the 0.0, 1.0, 2.0 & 3.0% DGMEE groups. Based on the acute toxicity results (Task 1), drinking water levels of 0.0, 0.25, 1.25 & 2.5% DGMEE were selected for the continuous breeding phase of the study (Task 2). Continuous exposure of CD-l mice (11 weeks of age at outset) to up to 2.5% DGMEE had no effect on the number of pairs able to produce at least 1 litter. In addition, DGMEE had no influence on the number of litters/pair, live pups/litter, proportion of pups born alive, or sex (males/total) of pups born alive. In contrast, continuous exposure to the low dose of DGMEE did significantly reduce the adjusted mean live male pup weight & exposure to 2.5% DGMEE significantly reduced the adjusted mean live female pup weight relative to the control group. Due to the minimal effects of DGMEE on fertility & reproductive performance in the Task 2 parental mice (F0 generation), the second generation was evaluated in only the control & high dose groups (Task 4). Each weanling was maintained on the same treatment as their Task 2 parents. Body weights of the F1 male & female offspring continuously exposed to 2.5% DGMEE were slightly depressed at birth, at weaning & at 74 + 10 days of age relative to control F1 male & female offspring. At 74 + 10 days of age, a male & female from different litters within treatment groups were cohabited for 1 wk. The pairs were then separated & the females allowed to deliver their litters. Continuous exposure of the mice to DGMEE had no statistically significant effects on mating behavior, fertility rate, number of live pups/litter, proportion of pups born alive, sex males/total of pups born alive or live pup weight. The 0.0 & 2.5% DGMEE F1 parental mice were necropsied at the conclusion of Task 4. Sperm assessment indicated no significant differences in the sperm concn or % abnormal sperm in the cauda epididymis between male mice exposed to 0.0 or 2.5% DGMEE. Conversely, sperm samples from mice in the 2.5% DGMEE group had significantly fewer motile sperm than did the controls. Although body weight was unaffected, the adjusted liver weight was significantly increased & the adjusted brain weight was significantly decreased in males & females exposed to 2.5% DGMEE relative to controls. Under the conditions of this reproductive study, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (at doses as high as 2.5% in the drinking water) was not a reproductive toxicant in either F0 or F1 breeding pairs of Swiss CD-l mice, although DGMEE was associated with significantly decreased sperm motility in the F1 males. DGMEE (2.5% in the drinking water) increased liver weight & decreased brain weight in both sexes of the F1 generation.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.126 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diethylene glycol monoethyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diethylene glycol monoethyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.7 hours. Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 12. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Aerobic biological screening studies, which utilized settled wastewater, sewage, or activated sludge for inocula, indicate that diethylene glycol monoethyl ether should biodegrade rapidly in soil and water following an acclimation period. If released into water, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to diethylene glycol monoethyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diethylene glycol monoethyl ether is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to diethylene glycol monoethyl ether via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other consumer products containing diethylene glycol monoethyl ether.

Vapor-phase diethylene glycol monoethyl ether is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.7 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.72X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 23 \u00b0C(3). Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

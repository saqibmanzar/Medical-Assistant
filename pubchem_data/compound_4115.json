Dermal contact with methoxychlor is slightly irritating to skin. Chronic oral exposure of animals to methoxychlor has resulted in effects to the liver, kidneys, and nervous system. Reproductive and developmental effects are the primary concern from methoxychlor exposure. Animal studies have reported developmental and reproductive effects, such as abortions, reduced fertility, reduced litter size, and skeletal effects from oral exposure to methoxychlor. EPA has classified methoxychlor as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. Inhalation studies are not available for methoxychlor. However, oral studies are available and a risk management decision can be made to assume that the hazards resulting from oral exposure may be indicative of that resulting from inhalation exposure.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The prooestrogenic pesticide methoxychlor (MXC), however, has shown a differential effect on proliferative activity. An increase in uterine growth is present, while the pituitary undergoes a decrease in size, even though the effect is accompanied by a characteristic estrogen-induced elevation in pituitary prolactin concentration. The focus of the current study was whether the observed differences in tissue growth between uterus and pituitary in response to MXC administration were paralleled by a corresponding disparity in the expression of those growth factors (members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin families and their receptors) that are involved in the angiogenic cascade. Ovariectomized adult Sprague-Dawley female rats were administered MXC (0-200 mg/kg, oral) for 1 or 3 weeks. Immunohistochemical staining of uteri and pituitaries was performed under strictly controlled conditions for VEGF and its receptor VEGFR2, Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and angiopoietin-2 and their tyrosine kinase receptor Tie2, and platelet endothelial adhesion factor (as an index of vascularity). Image acquisition and densitometric assessments of staining intensity were conducted under blind conditions. The results showed uterine MXC-induced increases in the expression of VEGFR2 and Ang1, changes consistent with a normal proliferative response to oestrogenic stimulation. For VEGF, staining tended to be most pronounced in the stromal region, although there did not appear to be a progressive increase with dose. VEGFR2 expression showed significant dose-related trends in luminal and glandular epithelia by 1 week. Similar effects at 1 week were evident for Ang1 in glandular epithelium. In the anterior pituitary, a dose-related increase in VEGF was present for the 1 and 3 week treatments, and the number of pituitary vessels per unit area was also increased after 3 weeks. The effects indicate that even though the insecticide has not been found to cause an augmentation in pituitary growth, a dose-related rise in the expression of at least one principal angiogenic factor is present that may be associated with an increase in vascular density.",

Because Bcl-2 (an antiapoptotic factor), Bax (a proapoptotic factor), gonadotropins, and estradiol are important regulators of atresia in the ovary, the purpose of this study was first to examine whether MXC-induced atresia occurred through alterations in Bcl-2 or Bax, and second, to examine the effect of MXC on gonadotropins, estradiol, and their receptors. CD-1 mice were dosed with 8-64 mg kg(-1) day(-1) MXC or vehicle (sesame oil). Ovaries were subjected to analysis of antral follicle numbers, Bcl-2, Bax, estrogen receptor, and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor levels. Blood was used to measure gonadotropins and estradiol. In some experiments, mice that overexpressed Bcl-2 or mice that were deficient in Bax were dosed with MXC or vehicle and their ovaries were analyzed for atresia. MXC caused a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of atretic antral follicles compared with controls at the 32 and 64 mg kg(-1) day(-1) doses of MXC. MXC treatment did not result in changes in Bcl-2 levels, but it did result in an increase in Bax levels in antral follicles. MXC treatment did not affect gonadotropin or estradiol levels, nor did it affect the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone or estrogen receptors. Mice that overexpressed Bcl-2 or mice that were deficient in Bax were protected from MXC-induced atresia. These data suggest that MXC induces atresia through direct effects on the Bax and Bcl-2 signaling pathways in the ovary.",

MXC and its metabolites bind the estrogen receptor and function as endocrine disruptors. MXC diminishes the uterine decidual cell response, necessary for the support of pregnancy. Hoxa10 is an estrogen-regulated gene that is an essential mediator of the decidual response and necessary for pregnancy. ... A mechanism by which MXC disrupts uterine function is by suppressing Hoxa10 expression. MXC treatment of mice produced a mild uterotropic response as measured by increased uterine weight and epithelial height. MXC treatment of uterine Ishikawa cells in vitro induced Hoxa10 expression. Estrogen receptor (ER) binding to the HOXA10 estrogen response element (ERE) was promoted by treatment with estradiol (E2); however, MXC disrupted E2/ER/ERE complex formation and gel shift. MXC alone allowed weak ER/ERE binding. In vivo MXC blocked the effect of E2 on Hoxa10 expression. Neonatal MXC treatment resulted in an immediate suppression and cellular restriction of Hoxa10 expression as well as a permanent generalized decrease in expression that persisted in the adult. MXC inhibited the expression of Hoxa10, a gene necessary for uterine development and function. One common mechanism by which endocrine disrupting chemicals produce lasting reproductive tract defects is through permanent alteration of developmental gene expression.",

An in vitro follicle culture system /was used/ to test the hypothesis that MXC is directly toxic to antral follicles, and that overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, or deletion of pro-apoptotic Bax, protects antral follicles from MXC-induced toxicity. Antral follicles were isolated from wild-type (WT), Bcl-2 overexpressing (Bcl-2 OE), or Bax deficient (BaxKO) mice, and exposed to dimethylsulfoxide (control) or MXC (1-100 ug/mL) for 96 hr. Follicle diameters were measured every 24 hr to assess growth. After 96 hr, follicles were histologically evaluated for atresia or collected for quantitative PCR analysis of Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA levels. MXC (10-100 ug/mL) significantly inhibited antral follicle growth at 72 and 96 hr, and increased atresia (100 ug/mL) compared to controls at 96 hr. Furthermore, MXC increased Bax mRNA levels between 48-96 hr and decreased Bcl-2 mRNA levels at 96 hr. While MXC inhibited growth of WT antral follicles beginning at 72 h, it did not inhibit growth of Bcl-2 OE or BaxKO follicles until 96 h. MXC also increased atresia of small and large WT and BaxKO antral follicles over controls, but it did not increase atresia of large Bcl-2 OE antral follicles over controls. These data suggest that MXC directly inhibits follicle growth partly by Bcl-2 and Bax pathways, and increases atresia partly through Bcl-2 pathways.",

Information on the acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) effects of methoxychlor in humans is not available. In an acute oral study in animals, changes in the liver were reported. Dermal contact with methoxychlor is slightly irritating to skin. Chronic oral exposure of animals to methoxychlor has resulted in effects to the liver, kidneys, and nervous system. Reproductive and developmental effects are the primary concern from methoxychlor exposure. Animal studies have reported developmental and reproductive effects, such as abortions, reduced fertility, reduced litter size, and skeletal effects from oral exposure to methoxychlor. EPA has classified methoxychlor as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. Inhalation studies are not available for methoxychlor. However, oral studies are available and a risk management decision can be made to assume that the hazards resulting from oral exposure may be indicative of that resulting from inhalation exposure.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

HPTE is an estrogen receptor alpha agonist, and also acts as an antagonist at the estrogen receptor beta and androgen receptor. This affects protein synthesis, which is believed to cause many of methoxychlor's estrogenic effects, such as decreased fertility. As methoxychlor is also a structural analogue of DDT, it is believed to have the same neurotoxic effects. This includes preventing the deactivation of the sodium gate after neuron activation and membrane depolarization, resulting in hyperexcitability of the nerve. Like DDT, methoxychlor may also inhibit neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase, which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. This contributes to the reduced rate of depolarization and increases the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. (T10, A118)",

We have previously reported that in utero and lactational exposure to high doses of GE or the endocrine active pesticide methoxychlor (MXC) caused mammary epithelial proliferation in 21-day-old male rats. Combined exposure to GE and MXC resulted in significant feminization of the male mammary glands. The goals of the current study were to evaluate mammary responses to GE and MXC at the adult stage and investigate relevant mechanisms. Following in utero, lactational exposure (through maternal diet), and direct dietary exposure, the inguinal mammary gland of male rats (90 days of age) was found to exhibit significant morphological alterations in the groups treated with GE and/or MXC compared to the control. GE exposure (at 300 and 800 ppm concentrations) caused lobular enlargement and epithelial proliferation, whereas MXC exposure (800 ppm) led to ductal elongation and lobular enlargement. Combining the two treatments caused prominent proliferation of both ducts and alveoli; secretory material was seen in readily recognizable alveolar lumens, which are absent in untreated male mammary. We also surveyed gene expression in the mammary tissue using a cDNA microarray and evaluated relevant protein factors. The results indicated that the treatment effects are likely due to interactions between steroid hormone receptor-mediated signals and growth factor-driven cellular pathways. The distinctive responses associated with the GE+MXC combination were likely linked to enhanced actions of insulin-like growth factor 1 and related downstream pathways.",

In addition, methoxychlor was found to accumulate in the fat and liver in amounts approximately 15-19 times the levels observed in control animals. Carbon tetrachloride is known to inactivate certain hepatic enzymes (CYPs or cytochrome P450s) which metabolize xenobiotics, thereby increasing their retention. These data suggest that carbon tetrachloride and other chemicals which inhibit the metabolism of methoxychlor may increase the risk of neurotoxicity.",

Although it was not investigated in this study, methoxychlor usually does not produce effects of the liver by itself at such low doses.

Aspirate oral and pharyngeal secretion, and when possible, insert an oropharyngeal airway to maintain an open passage unobstructed by the tongue. Minimize noise and any manipulation of the patient that may trigger seizure activity. Seizures in patients caused by organochlorine toxicity are likely to be prolonged and difficult to control. Status epilepticus is common. For this reason, patients with seizures that do not respond immediately to anticonvulsants should be transferred as soon as possible to a trauma center and will generally require intensive care admission until seizures are controlled and neurologic status is improved.

Whether treatment with methoxychlor at low observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) would alter the activities of steroidogenic enzymes such as Delta(5)3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) and Delta(5)17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD), the expression levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein and androgen binding protein (ABP) in the testis of adult male rats /was examined/. The experimental rats were exposed to a single dose of methoxychlor (50 mg/kg body weight) orally. The rats were killed at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 72 hr following treatment ... and testes were collected, processed and used to measure the activities of 3beta-HSD, 17beta-HSD, levels of hydrogen peroxide produced and the expression levels of StAR protein, and ABP. Methoxychlor administration resulted in a sequential reduction in the expression of StAR protein and activities of 3beta-HSD, 17beta-HSD with concomitant increase in the levels of hydrogen peroxide in the testis. These changes were significant between 6-12 hr following treatment. The levels of ABP declined at 6-12 hr following exposure to methoxychlor. ...",

For each species, 20 animals of each sex were placed on test as controls. The time weighted avg high and low dietary concentrations of methoxychlor were, respectively, 845 and 448 ppm for male rats, 1385 and 750 ppm for female rats, 3491 and 1746 ppm for male mice, and 1994 and 997 ppm for female mice. After a treatment period of 78 wk, the rat groups were observed for an additional 34 wk and the mouse groups for an additional 15 wk. A dose related mean group body weight depression was observed in both rats and mice, but no effect on survival was detected. Under the conditions of this study, methoxychlor was not found to be carcinogenic in Osborne-Mendel rats or B6C3F1 mice of either sex.

Sacrificed on Day 12, their treated dermis was harvested and examined for a reduction in number of sebaceous glands, a potential indicator of epidermal carcinogenicity. The authors noted wide variability (p = 25.72) in number of sebaceous glands per centimeter skin between mice, while there was great consistency between different sites on the same animal. Study authors also reported strong dose-related reduction in sebaceous glands in association with known epidermal carcinogens (data not provided), while average methoxychlor values (38.0 sebaceous glands/cm) were within the range of those of the benzene solvent control (averages in 4 experiments, 34.3 - 50.6 sebaceous glands/cm).",

These studies examined route of exposure and vulnerability to biological impact of EDCs over the life cycle in a precocial avian model, the Japanese quail. Embryonic exposure occurs with maternal deposition and methoxychlor (MXC) accumulated with maternal exposure. Egg injections of MXC or estradiol at selected stages of development impacted hypothalamic neuroendocrine systems in hatchlings and affected sexual maturation, with evidence for long-term effects on neurotransmitters and male behavior. Two-generation dietary studies were conducted to examine transgenerational effects of EDCs. Adult quail (P1) were exposed to dietary MXC (0, 0.5 and 5 ppm), with continued exposure in their offspring (F1), and control diet for all F2 chicks. Toxicological end points, including fertility, hatching success, and 14-day viability were unaffected. F1 and F2 male offspring from MXC-treated pairs MXC had impaired mating behavior and altered plasma hormones. These studies confirm neuroendocrine and behavioral measures as reliable indices of exposure to an estrogenic EDC. Moreover, maternal deposition remains a primary route of EDC exposure, with potential deleterious consequences for field birds, especially precocial species that appear to be particularly sensitive to embryonic EDC exposure.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.2X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methoxychlor will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase methoxychlor will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 hours. Particulate-phase methoxychlor will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. This compound may photolyze on soil surfaces based on studies reporting the photolysis of dry methoxychlor films exposed to sunlight. If released to soil, methoxychlor is expected to have no mobility based on Koc values from 23,000 to 93,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.03X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, methoxychlor is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its Koc range. Methoxychlor is resistant to biodegradation under aerobic conditions but biodegrades fairly readily in anaerobic environments; methoxychlor was not degraded over a 100-day period in aerobic soil while 73% degradation was observed under anaerobic conditions for the same time period. Measured BCF values of 138 and 8,300 in sheepshead minnows and fathead minnows, respectively, suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process; the hydrolysis half-life of methoxychlor in water at 27 \u00b0C and pH 3-7 is estimated as 367 days, and at pH 9 it is estimated as 270 days; the hydrolysis half-life in soil may be longer due to soil adsorption. Occupational exposure to methoxychlor may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methoxychlor was produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population is exposed to methoxychlor via ingestion of contaminated food and drinking water, dermal contact with this compound, and inhalation of ambient air. Methoxychlor was most likely to be found in US crop foods where it was used as an insecticide. (SRC)",

Mass balances in pond, river and wet sand (25% moisture) systems spiked with methoxychlor indicate that 98.6, 97.0, and 92.1%, respectively, of all methoxychlor was retained in the sediment(3). Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.03X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(5). According to a classification scheme(6), measured BCF values of 138(7) and 8,300(8) in sheepshead minnows and fathead minnows, respectively, suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Methoxychlor added to sediment-water mixtures was slowly biodegraded under aerobic conditions (half-lives of 115 and 206 days) and rapidly degraded anaerobically with half-lives of <28 days(9). The effect of hydrolysis(10,11) and oxidation(12,13) on the persistence of methoxychlor in the environment is expected to be negligible.",

Methoxychlor degraded rapidly in sediments with half-lives of less than 28 days under N aeration (Eh less than -50 mv), 49 to 55 days under static aerobic conditions and 115 to 206 days in air-purged flasks (Eh 220 to 464 mv). The major degradation products were dechlorinated methoxychlor (DMDD) and mono- and di-hydroxy derivatives of methoxychlor and dechlorinated methoxychlor. Dihydroxy- derivatives represented 15% of extractable radioactivity in pond sediments and 28% in lake sediments after 448 days of aerobic incubation. Under N aeration, mono- and dihydroxy- derivatives represented 44 to 65% of extractable (14)C after 28 days incubation(1).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The hydrolysis half-life of methoxychlor in water at 27 \u00b0C and pH 3-7 is estimated to be 367 days based on a rate constant of 2.2X10-8 per sec (extrapolated from data at elevated temperatures)(2); at pH 9 its hydrolysis half-life has been estimated to be 270 days(3), although the hydrolysis half-life in soil is probably longer due to adsorption to the soil(3). Half-lives of methoxychlor in distilled water at 27 \u00b0C are 1 yr (pH 7), 5.5 yr (pH 9), 0.21 days (pH 13)(4). Assuming first-order kinetics, the midsummer photolysis half-life of methoxychlor is estimated to be 4.5 months in distilled water at latitude 40 deg N, and 2.2-5.4 hours in filtered, sterilized, natural waters at latitude 34 deg N(5). Films of pure compound on solid surfaces absorb sunlight more rapidly than dilute solutions(5), thus photolysis of methoxychlor in the adsorbed form may be even more rapid(SRC). The half lives for methoxychlor in distilled water, and from a glass surface in winter, have been reported as 999.99 and 26.66 days (degradation rate of 0.03 1/day), respectively(6).",

In distilled water, 1,1-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)- 2,2-dichloroethylene is the major photolysis product of methoxychlor and p-methoxybenzaldehyde is a minor product(2). The UV irradiation of methoxychlor in the presence of methyl oleate produced several addition products in a reaction performed to mimic the photoinduced addition of pesticides to biomolecules(3). The half-lives for  photodecomposition of methoxychlor (40 ppb) under sunlight in distilled water (pH 6.3), Suwannee river (pH 4.7), Tombigbee river (pH 7.6), Alabama river (pH 7.7), and 20 ppm \"humic acid\" in distilled water (pH 5.2) were 300, 2.2, 5.4, 2.9, and 7.3 hours, respectively, and there was no reaction in 2 hours for Withlacoochee river (pH 8.2) and South Georgia stream (pH 7.2)(4).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In another study, a K value of 620 was found in a water-sediment system(2). Another study determined a K value of 2009 in soil(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that methoxychlor is expected to be immobile in soil.

A study involving 820 samples taken from 49 agrichemical facilities located throughout Illinois, reported that methoxychlor was detected in 3 soil samples collected from 2 facilities at concns ranging from 190 to 630 ug/kg (common range of detection limits = 4 to 100 ug/kg), median 500 ug/kg(2). Methoxychlor was detected in water samples at concentrations of 0.022 and 0.04 ppm from two different sampling sites out of seven total sites that directly receive surface run-offs from sugarcane fields in Kenya, taken in October 2002(3).

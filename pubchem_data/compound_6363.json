Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as a solvent, intermediate in synthesis of rubber accelerators, pharmaceuticals, dyes, insecticides, bactericides, textile specialties, and surface-active agents, dehairing agent, solubilizer for 2,4-D acid. HUMAN STUDIES: Complaints of nose and throat irritation were reported by volunteer subjects after brief exposures at 10 to 20 ppm. Workers complained of transient visual disturbances (halos around lights) after exposure to the vapor for 8 hours, probably resulting from mild corneal edema, which usually cleared in 3 to 4 hours. ANIMAL STUDIES: A 4-hour exposure of 10,000 mg/cu m (4000 ppm) to 6 rats was not lethal, while all 6 rats died from exposure to 20,000 mg/cu m (8000 ppm). Exposure to a saturated vapor caused the death of all rats within 2 minutes. Isopropylamine produced a severe burn from application of 0.5 mL of a 1% solution. Instillation of 0.005 mL of undiluted compound resulted in severe corneal opacity while 0.5 mL of a 1% solution in water caused severe corneal opacity and iritis. In mice, isopropylamine is essentially an upper respiratory tract-irritating compound. In a one generation reproduction study rats were exposed to isopropylamine at analytical concentrations of 20, 100 or 499 mg/cu m for 6 hr per day (5 days/week) by inhalation (whole body exposure). Clinical signs included incidental fur discoloration and focal hair loss. There were no significant differences in mating and fertility parameters, number of corpora lutea, implantations and resorptions. The was a reduction in mean body weight gain in males in the high dose group. Negative results were reported in bacterial reverse mutation tests for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium (strains included TA1535, TA1537, TA98 and TA100) with and without metabolic activation. The highest non-toxic dose tested was 3333 mg/plate.",

Additional examinations may be necessary if a worker develops symptoms attributable to isopropylamine exposure. The interviews, examinations, and medical screening tests should focus on identifying the adverse effects of isopropylamine on the eyes, skin, or respiratory system.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 580 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isopropylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase isopropylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.3 hours. Isopropylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isopropylamine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 11. The pKa of isopropylamine is 10.6, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in cation form in the environment and cations generally absorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. Isopropylamine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Manometric Respirometry test, 70-80% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, isopropylamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A pKa of 10.6 indicates isopropylamine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process.  An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to isopropylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isopropylamine is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to isopropylamine via inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food, and dermal contact with consumer products containing isopropylamine.

However, the pKa of isopropylamine is 10.6(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization of isopropylamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because this compound exists almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and cations do not volatilize. Isopropylamine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 580 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(6). A 70-80% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Manometric Respirometry test(7) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

A pKa of 10.6(4) indicates isopropylamine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3.2(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

Isopropylamine, present at 100 mg/L, reached 70-80% of its theoretical BOD in 28 days using an activated sludge inoculum in the Manometric Respirometry test and was confirmed to be readily biodegradable(3). Isopropylamine reached greater than 95% degradation after 14 days using industrial, non-adapted sludge in an inherent Zahn-Wellens/EMPA test; based on the high degradation rate after 5 days, isopropylamine was considered readily biodegradable(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

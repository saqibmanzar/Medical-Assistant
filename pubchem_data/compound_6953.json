Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The splenocytes of DS-Nh mice were cultured with SEB and the cytokine levels in the supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ... Significant skin changes were observed on the skin even where TNCB was not applied in both mice treated with TNCB. Increases in S. aureus on the skin and serum IgE levels were detected in DS-Nh mice, but not in NC/Nga mice. In DS-Nh mice, IFN-gamma and IL-13 production of splenocytes increased in the mice treated with TNCB. /THe authors concluded that/ these results suggest that there might be a different mechanism of dermatitis induction between NC/Nga and DS-Nh mice.

A new model of liver injury induced in mice by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to picryl chloride (PCl) mimicks the pathogenesis of human hepatitis /was reported/. This liver injury is mediated by CD4+ T cells. The interaction between lymphocyte function associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) is an essential process for hepatocyte (HC) damage. The present study was undertaken to reveal the role of Th1 and Th2-like cytokines in regulating the liver injury. ... The kinetics of cytokine production were examined by ELISA and RT-PCR after the elicitation of liver injury for both serum protein and liver mRNA expression, respectively. A co-culture assay between liver nonparenchymal cells (NPC) and HC was conducted to evaluate the cytokine regulation on the cell-cell interaction. Expression of LFA-1 on NPC and ICAM-1 on HC were examined by FACScan and ELISA, respectively. ... Serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma showed a peak production at 6 and 12 hr, while IL-5 and IL-4 reached their maximum levels at 18 and 24 hr after induction of liver injury, respectively. Liver mRNA expression of IFN-gamma and IL-4 had a similar time course to their corresponding products. Both recombinant murine IFN-gamma and IL-2 triggered the hepatotoxicity of NPC or spleen cells at 0 h. In this case, an increased expression of both LFA-1 on NPC and ICAM-1 on HC was also observed. In contrast, IL-4 and IL-5 completely abolished the hepatotoxicity of NPC at 12 hr without influencing the adhesion molecules. /The authors concluded that/ Th1 and Th2 may be involved in regulating liver injury. Th1/Th2 balance may critically contribute to the production of the liver injury or recovery from it.",

The peak expression of LFA-1 on SPC was seen at 6 hr after eliciting liver injury, and then that of LFA-1 on NPC and ICAM-1 on HC appeared at 12 hr. Thereafter, the serum ALT elevation reached to a peak at 18 hr. A splenectomy before the PCl elicitation significantly reduced the ALT elevation. Both SPC and NPC from liver injury mice induced a remarkable release of ALT from HC in vitro, in parallel with their LFA-1 expression. The pre-treatment of NPC or SPC with anti-LFA-1 mAb, irrespective of the presence of complement, completely blocked the ALT release. Also, when HC was prebound with anti-ICAM-1 mAb, neither NPC nor SPC showed a cytotoxicity against the HC. Furthermore, the treatment of NPC with either anti-Thy1.2 or anti-CD4 mAb in the presence but not absence of complement, showed a complete abolishment of ALT release. Anti-CD8 mAb plus complement also tended to inhibit ALT release. The twofold increase in CD4+ LFA-1+ and mild increase in CD8+ LFA-1+ populations were also confirmed in NPC at 12 hr. These results suggest that PCl elicitation in liver may trigger an increased expression of LFA-1 on SPC and NPC and ICAM-1 on HC. LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction between liver-infiltrating NPC, mainly including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and HC may be an essential step for the hepatocyte damage in PCl-DTH liver injury.",

Distinct changes of biochemical parameters were observed including the elevation of serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, increase of liver lipid peroxides, as well as decrease of serum alkaline phosphatase. Damage was confirmed by histopathological findings such as hepatocellular necrosis, granulocyte infiltration, and fatty degeneration. The liver injury was passively transferred into naive syngeneic mice by infusing spleen cells from immune mice. The capacity of the splenocytes to induce liver injury in recipient mice was almost completely abolished by pretreatment of the cells with anti-Thy 1.2 or anti-CD4, but not anti-CD8 antibody. These findings suggest that the production of liver injury by a local DTH mechanism is possible and the subpopulation of T cells, Thy-1.2+, L3T4+, and Lyt-2- cells, is at least one of the effector cells that mediate the injury.",

This gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method is used to determine the concentration of semivolatile organic compounds in extracts prepared from all types of solid waste matrices, soils, and ground water. The practical quantitation limit for determining an individual compound is approximately 1 mg/kg (wet weight) for soil/sediment samples, 1-200 mg/kg for wastes, and 10 ug/l for ground water samples. This method is applicable to quantify most neutral, acidic, and basic organic compounds that are soluble in methylene chloride, including the title compound, and capable of being eluted without derivatization as sharp peaks from a gas chromatographic packed column. For base/neutral compound detection, a 2 m by 2 mm ID stainless or glass column packed with 3% SP-2250-DB on 100/120 mesh Supelcoport or equivalent is used. For acid compound detection, a 2 m by 2 mm ID glass column packed with 1% SP-1240-DA on 100/120 mesh Supelcoport or equivalent is used. A representative sample is collected in a glass container equipped with a Teflon-lined cap. Care is taken to avoid sample contact with any plastic. Under the prescribed conditions, nitrobenzene has a detection limit of 1.9 ug/l, a range for the average recovery of four measurements of 1.D9-3.05 ug/l, and a limit for the standard deviation of 39.3 ug/l. /Nitrobenzene/",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Histamine was found to produce less response in mice to PCl. In contrast, cimetidine, a selective antagonist of histamine type 2 receptor, significantly enhanced the response, while diphenhydramine, a selective antagonist of histamine type 1 receptor showed no effect. The pre-treatment of 2,4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) significantly caused a tolerance to the formation of the liver injury induced by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to PCl. Against the tolerance, the single iv administration of 150 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (Cy) at 3 days before the TNBS-treatment recovered the response and induced a remarkable elevation of serum transaminases. On the other hand, cyclosporin A protected the liver injury. These observations revealed that the development of acute PCl-DTH liver injury was regulated by the functional state of suppressor and helper T cells.",

Rolipram, prednisolone and cyclosporine A were administered orally once daily from day 0 to 21. Rolipram at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day significantly inhibited the ear thickness and the increase in cytokine levels and enzyme activity in the ear. Interleukin (IL)-4 production was markedly decreased in cervical lymph node cells from animals treated with rolipram at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. Prednisolone and cyclosporine A significantly reduced ear thickness. These compounds significantly decreased the total cell and lymphocyte number of the cervical lymph nodes. Furthermore, prednisolone markedly suppressed body weight gain, and cyclosporine A significantly increased the serum total IgE concentration compared with that in the vehicle-treated control. Rolipram, unlike prednisolone and cyclosporine A, did not influence body weight and the total IgE concentration in the serum. The present results suggest that the PDE4 inhibitor is a promising oral medicine for the treatment of chronic skin inflammatory diseases.",

Oral administration of extract from Hatakeshimeji (Lyophyllum decastes, LD extract) to NC/Nga mice inhibited the development of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions /induced by repeated application of picryl chloride/ based on lower total skin severity scores and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Splenic lymphocytes were stimulated with the T cell mitogen concanavalin A, and secretion of a Th1 cytokine (IFN-gamma) and a Th2 cytokine (IL-4) was determined by ELISA. IFN-gamma production was not inhibited by treatment with LD extract. On the other hand, IL-4 production was significantly decreased by treatment with LD extract. These results suggest that LD extract exerts anti-allergic actions by suppressing the serum IgE and Th2-type immune responses.",

This study ... first investigated the cellular immune responses in mice with chronic liver injury induced by delayed-type hypersensitivity to picryl chloride (PCl). A continuous reduction, after week 3 of liver injury, was observed in the level of PCl-induced contact sensitivity but not in sheep red blood cell-induced footpad reaction, suggesting the presence of PCl-specific suppression. When spleen cells from mice whose liver had been injured for 1 week were systemically transferred into syngeneic recipients with the liver injury, the elevation in serum lactic dehydrogenase and the decrease in alkaline phosphatase and albumin levels in recipient mice were significantly exacerbated. However, when the liver damage in the donor mouse was allowed to proceed for 3, 5 or 7 weeks, biochemical changes in recipients were reduced to near normal levels. A flow-cytometric assay demonstrated that the number of CD4+ T cells in both spleen cells and liver nonparenchymal cells decreased dramatically during the late phase of liver injury, while CD8+ counts did not. These findings suggest that CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes may contribute to the positive and negative regulation, respectively, of the early and late phases in the chronic development of liver injury.",

The changes of most biochemical parameters were similar in these three strains, namely, the activities of serum transaminases, lactic dehydrogenase, and prolidase were elevated significantly on day 1, during the first several weeks, and almost throughout the duration, respectively, of liver injury. The content of liver hydroxyproline was also increased after 1-9 weeks of liver injury. In addition, a significant decrease of liver weight, serum alkaline phosphatase and albumin level was observed in BALB/c and Kunming mice. Similar changes in liver histology were also found in the three strains. The hepatocellular necrosis and inflammatory infiltration into the portal area were the predominant features on day 1 and were still distinct during the subsequent several weeks. The mild or moderate hepatocellular degeneration, regeneration and connective tissue hyperplasia were observed after 1 or 3 weeks. A bridging necrosis between portal and portal was observed in several BALB/c and ICR mice, reflecting the possibility of exacerbation of liver injury. ...",

PCL was applied to the left ear of each mouse 4 (1st), 11 (2nd), 18 (3rd) and 25 days (4th) after sensitization of the abdominal skin with PCL. Time course examinations were carried out on the ear swelling responses, total IgE levels, skin histology and immunohistochemistry for infiltrated cells after the 1st and 4th application. In IQI mice, the peak time of the ear swelling responses tended to shift from 24 hr to 9 hr with marked elevation of total IgE levels and marked increase of mast cells showing degranulation after the 4th application when CD8(+) cells as well as CD4(+) cells also prominently increased. In BALB/c mice, except for the total IgE levels and the number of mast cells, the degrees of ear swelling responses, histological changes and increase of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells were much less severe. Female IQI mice are considered to be a useful mouse strain for further investigations on the role of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the pathogenesis of contact dermatitis.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.1X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene will be very slowly degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 115 years. Particulate-phase 2-chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2-Chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 140. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.5X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 2-chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. 2-Chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is expected to be resistant to biodegradation under aerobic conditions in soil and water as the presence of multiple nitro groups and a halogen group, as found in its structure, have been reported to decrease biodegradability. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 18 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A hydrolysis half-life of 127 days at pH 7 has been reported for 2-chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene. Occupational exposure to 2-chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene may have occurred during its former production through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene was produced or used.

According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 18(SRC), from its water solubility (2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 2-Chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is expected to be resistant to biodegradation under aerobic conditions in water(SRC) as the presence of multiple nitro groups and a halogen group, as found in its structure, have been reported to decrease biodegradability(6). 2-Chloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is expected to slowly hydrolyze in water with a half-life of 127 days at pH 7(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

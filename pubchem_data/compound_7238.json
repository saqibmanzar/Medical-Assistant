When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Exposure may occur at sites where 2-chlorotoluene is manufactured or used as a pesticide, solvent, or intermediate in the synthesis of dyes, pharmaceuticals, or synthetic rubber chemicals. This colorless liquid may exert its strong irritant properties upon dermal contact or inhalation. To assure protection against 2-chlorotoluene exposure a full-face mask self-contained breathing apparatus and protective clothing should be worn. The ACGIH recommends maintaining an 8-hr TLV of 50 ppm. While this substance must be moderately heated before ignition occurs, 2-chlorotoluene is nevertheless considered a combustion hazard. For fires involving 2-chlorotoluene, extinguish with \"alcohol foam\", CO2, dry chemical, or water in flooding quantities as fog (solid streams may be ineffective). Flooding quantities of water should be applied from as far a distance as possible, to cool affected containers. This substance should be stored away from heat or flames. Shipping regulations and other DOT regulatory requirements should be consulted before transport. For small spills of 2-chlorotoluene, take up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and place into containers for later disposal. For large spills, dike to prevent 2-chlorotoluene from entering water sources and sewers. Prior to implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge) consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

If released to the atmosphere, 2-chlorotoluene will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere based on a measured vapor pressure of 3.43 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 2-chlorotoluene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 9 days. Measured Koc values from 170-880 indicate that 2-chlorotoluene may have low to moderate mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist and dry soil surfaces may occur based on a measured Henry's Law constant of 3.57X10-3 atm-cu m/mole and 2-chlorotoluene's measured vapor pressure, respectively. Based on limited data, 2-chlorotoluene may be resistant to biodegradation. A second order rate constant for the microbial degradation of 2-chlorotoluene in natural water was experimentally determined to be 2.7X10-11 L/organism-hr. At 100 ppm, 2-chlorotoluene showed only 0-<30% biodegradation in 14 days using an activated sludge inoculum. However, a microbial consortium of 10 different bacteria and 2 fungi was able to degrade 2-chlorotoluene at a concentration of 200 mg/l; complete biodegradation occurred in 3 days. 2-Chlorotoluene may adsorb to sediment and suspended matter in water based on its measured Koc values. This compound may volatilize from water surfaces given its Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. BCF values from 20-112, measured in carp, indicate that 2-chlorotoluene may bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. The general population may be exposed to 2-chlorotoluene by inhalation of contaminated air or ingestion of contaminated drinking water. Workers involved in the manufacture, use, packaging, or transport of this compound may be exposed by inhalation and/or dermal contact. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Volatilization appeared to be the dominant removal mechanism. Volatilization in a bay or ocean should be significantly faster (perhaps up to an order of magnitude)(SRC) since turbulence in the mesocosm was substantially less than is found in bays or open oceans(1). The Henry's Law constant for 2-chlorotoluene was measured as 3.57X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(2). This value indicates that 2-chlorotoluene will volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 4 hours(3,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 5 days(3,SRC). 2-Chlorotoluene's experimental value for vapor pressure(4) and its measured Henry's Law constant(2) indicate that volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces, respectively, is likely(SRC).",

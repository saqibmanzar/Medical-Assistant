When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.87 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl chloroacetate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl chloroacetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 days. If released to soil, ethyl chloroacetate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 12. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.20X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyl chloroacetate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Ethyl chloroacetate is subject to hydrolysis under acidic and alkaline conditions and will be an important fate process. If released into water, ethyl chloroacetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 hr and 11 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to ethyl chloroacetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl chloroacetate is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of ethyl chloroacetate from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.20X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(4). The potential for volatilization of ethyl chloroacetate from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 4.87 mm Hg(5). Ethyl chloroacetate is subject to hydrolysis under acidic and alkaline conditions. Acid hydrolysis products could include ethyl alcohol and chloroacetic acid, both very soluble in water. Alkaline hydrolysis of the ester would yield products similar to acid hydrolysates except the chloroacetic acid would be in salt form. In addition, alkaline hydrolysis could result in the substitution of an OH group for the chlorine atom resulting in the production of glycolic acid in its salt form. Glycolic acid is water soluble as well as being susceptible to biodegradation(6).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.20X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 hr and 11 days, respectively(SRC). Ethyl chloroacetate is subject to hydrolysis under acidic and alkaline conditions. Acid hydrolysis products could include ethyl alcohol and chloroacetic acid, both very soluble in water. Alkaline hydrolysis of the ester would yield products similar to acid hydrolysates except the chloroacetic acid would be in salt form. In addition, alkaline hydrolysis could result in the substitution of an OH group for the chlorine atom resulting in the production of glycolic acid in its salt form. Glycolic acid is water soluble as well as being susceptible to biodegradation(7). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.",

Vapor-phase ethyl chloroacetate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.2X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined using a structure estimation method(3).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 12 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 9 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(2); this corresponds to half-lives of 9 days and 22 hr at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(2). Ethyl chloroacetate will hydrolyze in water with an ionic strength of 1.0 at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C with a half-life of 74 days(4). Ethyl chloroacetate is subject to hydrolysis under acidic and alkaline conditions. Acid hydrolysis products could include ethyl alcohol and chloroacetic acid, both very soluble in water. Alkaline hydrolysis of the ester would yield products similar to acid hydrolysates except the chloroacetic acid would be in salt form. In addition, alkaline hydrolysis could result in the substitution of an OH group for the chlorine atom resulting in the production of glycolic acid in its salt form. Glycolic acid is water soluble as well as being susceptible to biodegradation(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

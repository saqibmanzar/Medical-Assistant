Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

This technique is particularly useful to study aromatic, conjugated, and other substances containing a pi bond.  Modern ultraviolet spectrophotometers also cover the visible light range, in which case the technique is called ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Effects on reaction times were tested at all dose levels, memory (writing of the Lord's Prayer) was tested at 82,000 and 100,000 ppm, muscular coordination (as exemplified by the act of writing) was observed at 82,000, 100,000, and 144,000 ppm, and typewriting was tested at 100,000 ppm. In human subjects, 50,000 and 75,000 ppm of DME caused feelings of mild intoxication but no objective symptoms beyond slight lack of attention after 12-minutes exposure to the higher concentration. At 82,000 ppm, some incoordination developed after 21.5 minutes, and a complaint was made of indistinct vision. At 100,000 ppm, no objective symptoms occurred during the first 15 minutes. Distinct signs of incoordination developed after 21 minutes of exposure. The experiment continued for 64 minutes, with the subject unable to do simple tasks (i.e., balancing of the head required special effort, estimation of time was lost, simple multiplication and memory were affected). At 144,000 ppm, symptoms first occurred after 7 minutes with the subject losing consciousness after 26 minutes. Inhalation of 200,000 ppm caused unconsciousness in 17 minutes."

The dogs received a control injection of epinephrine (0.008 mg/kg) intravenously, prior to exposure and a challenge injection (same dosage) after breathing the test material for 5 minutes. The desired concentrations (calculated) were achieved by delivering a metered volume of the vapor or gas from the pressured cylinder containing the test substance and diluting it with a known volume of air. The flow meter used for monitoring the test compound had been previously calibrated with the compound by a dry gas test meter.

Exposure concentrations tested were 84,000, 121,000, 152,000, 169,000, and 205,000 ppm. ... The air/DME flow was maintained at 10 L/minute. ... During exposure, observations of clinical signs of toxicity were made. After exposure, the surviving rats were returned to their respective cages and were observed daily (weekends excluded) for 14 days. ... Surviving rats were sacrificed after a 14-day recovery period. ... Mortality of 0/10,3/10,2/10,7/10, and 7/10 occurred in the 84,000, 121,000, 152,000, 169,000, and 205,000 ppm groups, respectively. All but one death (205,000 ppm) occurred during the exposures. During exposure, the rats demonstrated ataxia (84,000 ppm and above), unresponsiveness to noise (121,000 ppm and above), anesthesia (84,000 ppm and above), paw waving (84,000 ppm), roving eyeballs (84,000 ppm), and coma (121,000 ppm and above). Ataxia was defined as uncoordinated. Anesthesia was considered unconsciousness with steady respirations (>50/min) and coma was considered unconsciousness with irregular, periodic or slow (<50/min) and shallow respirations. Post-exposure, survivors rapidly awoke and showed no clinical signs, other than transient weight loss for 1-2 days and sporadic lung noise.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4450 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dimethyl ether will exist solely as a gas in the ambient atmosphere. Gas-phase dimethyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and nitrate radicals; half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 5.4 and 123 days, respectively. Aliphatic ethers do not absorb light in the environmental spectrum; therefore dimethyl ether is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dimethyl ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 27. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.9X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Dimethyl ether is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation of dimethyl ether in soil and water is expected to be a slow process based upon its slow biodegradation in an aqueous screening study. If released into water, dimethyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon its estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon dimethyl ether's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 hours and 2.8 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to dimethyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimethyl ether is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to dimethyl ether via inhalation of consumer aerosol products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Gas-phase dimethyl ether is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and nitrate radicals(SRC); half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 5.4 and 123 days, respectively(3,4). Direct photolysis is not expected to be an important removal process since aliphatic ethers do not absorb light in the environmental spectrum(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that dimethyl ether is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the estimated volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is approximately 2.4 hours(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is approximately 2.8 days(SRC). Dimethyl ether's Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Volatilization of dimethyl ether from dry soil surfaces is expected(SRC) based upon this compound's vapor pressure(1).",

Dimethyl ether and liquefied petroleum gas concentrations were measured in the 'breathing zone' of an experimental manikin and an 'accompanying child' designed to simulate human use of hairsprays in a domestic situation and in the breathing zone of a 'stylist' and 'customer' under salon conditions. Results were expressed as the 10 min time weighted average in the air (TWA10) and as the peak concentration in the breathing zone of the 'user'. Following a 10 s use of hairspray containing 50% dimethyl ether or 26% liquefied petroleum gas, time weighted average in the air values for an adult user in a closed room (volume 21 cu m) were on average 114 ppm and 73 ppm respectively. The child time weighted average in the air values were 89 ppm (dimethyl ether) and 80 ppm (liquefied petroleum gas). Leaving the door open during spraying did not significantly alter these values. The peak concentrations measured in the user breathing zone were 1577 ppm of dimethyl ether and 671 ppm of liquefied petroleum gas. Simulated salon use of a hairspray gave a calculated value of 55 ppm dimethyl ether and 88 ppm liquefied petroleum gas for the stylist over an 8 h working period.",

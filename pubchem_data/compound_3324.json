When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

In cells infected with HSV-1, HSV-2 or VZV, the viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form that, in turn, is converted by cellular kinases to the active form penciclovir triphosphate. Biochemical studies demonstrate that penciclovir triphosphate inhibits HSV-2 DNA polymerase competitively with deoxyguanosine triphosphate. Consequently, herpes viral DNA synthesis and, therefore, replication are selectively inhibited. Penciclovir triphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 10 hours in HSV-1-, 20 hours in HSV-2- and 7 hours in VZV-infected cells grown in culture. However, the clinical significance of the intracellular half-life is unknown.",

The OH group is replaced by bromine using CBr4 and trimethyl phosphine. The bromo derivative is combined with 2-amino-6-chloropurine to alkylate in the 7-position.

The method involved simple, one-step SPE procedure coupled with a C(18) , 75 X 4.mm, 3 um column with a flow-rate of 0.5 mL/min, and acyclovir was used as the internal standard. The Quattro Micro mass spectrometry was operated under the multiple reaction-monitoring mode using the electrospray ionization technique. Using 250 uL plasma, the methods were validated over the concentration range 52.555-6626.181 ng/mL, with a lower limit of quantification of 52.55 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy values were found to be within the assay variability limits as per the FDA guidelines. The developed assay method was applied to a clinical pharmacokinetic study in human volunteers.",

Plasma samples were treated by solid-phase extraction with Oasis MCX (30 mg) cartridges. Ganciclovir, an antiviral drug structurally related to penciclovir, was used as internal standard (I.S.). Aqueous humor samples were directly injected into the chromatographic system. Separation was performed by a gradient elution with a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of acetonitrile and phosphate buffer 50mM containing 5mM of sodium octanesulfonate, pH 2.0, at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The method was validated and showed good performances in terms of linearity, sensitivity, precision and trueness. Quantification limit was obtained at 0.05 ug/mL for aqueous humor and at 0.1 ug/mL for plasma. Finally, the proposed analytical method was used to measure penciclovir in clinical samples for a pharmacokinetic study, after oral administration of famciclovir.",

Local exhaust ventilation is generally preferred to general exhaust because it can control the contaminant at its source, preventing dispersion into the work area. An industrial hygiene survey involving air monitoring may be used to determine the effectiveness of engineering controls. Effectiveness of engineering controls intended for use with highly potent materials should be assessed by use of nontoxic surrogate materials. Local exhaust ventilation such as a laboratory fume hood or other vented enclosure is recommended, particularly for grinding, crushing, weighing, or other dust-generating procedures."

Employees who are sensitive to natural rubber (latex) should use nitrile or other synthetic nonlatex gloves. Use of powdered latex gloves should be avoided due to the risk of latex allergy. Eye Protection: Safety glasses with sideshields are recommended. Face shields or goggles may be required if splash potential exists or if corrosive materials are present. Approved eye protection (e.g., bearing the ANSI Z87 or CSA stamp) is preferred. Maintain eyewash facilities in the work area. Protective Clothing: For handling of laboratory scale quantities, a cloth lab coat is recommended.

Approximately 2 months prior to this hospitalization, the woman was diagnosed with shingles of her left T1-T2 nerve distribution and was treated with famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily, which was her first exposure to this medication. Her shingles resolved; however, on day 4 of treatment, she began to notice red spots on both of her legs that began to progressively blister and increase in size. She discontinued famciclovir at that time. The rash persisted and spread to her abdomen, groin, legs, feet, and toes. She underwent punch biopsy that revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV). Workup was negative for antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, hepatitis B and C virus, perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, cytoplasmic-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens, proteinase 3, and myeloperoxidase. The patient improved with daily oral steroids and local wound care. ... The most common cause of LCV is medication use, but it is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is hypothesized that drugs act as haptens, which cause an immune response. An objective causality assessment using the Naranjo probability scale suggested that famciclovir was the probable cause of LCV in this patient.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.1X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates famciclovir will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase famciclovir will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Famciclovir contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, famciclovir is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 330. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.4X10-14 atm-cu m/mole. Famciclovir is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, famciclovir is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis may occur given base-catalyzed hydrolysis half-lives of 2 years and 61 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to famciclovir may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where famciclovir is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to famciclovir via administration of pharmaceutical products containing famciclovir. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

These are discharged after therapeutic use through human excretion. Effluent containing high concentration of antiviral drugs discharged from production facilities is also a cause of concern to nearby aquatic bodies. There is an increased interest in their removal because they are highly bioactive. Some antiviral drugs are resistant to conventional methods of degradation, and there is a risk of development of antiviral resistance in humans and animals if exposed repeatedly for long periods. To date, the potential human, animal, and ecological risks associated with the discharge of these antiviral compounds to the environment are not well documented. This study presents a brief summary on occurrence, ecotoxicological risks, and physicochemical properties of antiviral drugs in the environment. The needs regarding removal, disposal, and treatment of antiviral drugs are also addressed(1). /Antiviral drugs/"

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

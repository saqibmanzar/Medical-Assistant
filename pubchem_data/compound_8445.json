When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

A group of 50 animals of each sex served as matched controls. There was a dose-related depression in mean body weight gain throughout the study. By 75 weeks, 94, 96 and 62% of males, and 96, 98 and 76% of females were still alive in the control low dose and high-dose groups, respectively. Mortality was associated with the development of tumors of the urinary bladder and nasal cavity. Carcinomas of the urinary bladder, primarily of the transitional-cell type, were found in a dose-related trend in 0/48 control males, 16/48 low-dose males, 41/47 high-dose males, 0/47 control females, 31/49 low-dose females and 41/46 high-dose females. Bladder papillomas were found in 0/48 control males, 14/48 low-dose males, 3/47 high-dose males, 0/47 control females, 6/49 low-dose females and 2/46 high-dose females. A few rats had leiomyosarcomas of the bladder; and most of the treated rats did not have bladder neoplasms had bladder epithelial hyperplasia. Olfactory neuroblastomas were found in 0/48 control males, 1/50 low-dose males and 21/47 high-dose males (P<0.001), and in 0/50 control females, 0/50 low-dose females and 11/49 high-dose females (P<0.001). A few treated rats had other types of malignant nasal tumors or epithelial hyperplasia of the nasal epithelium. Neoplastic liver nodules, hepatocellular carcinomas or hepato-/cholangiocarcinomas were found in 0/48 control males, 13/49 low-dose males (P<0.001) and 2/46 high-dose males; and neoplastic liver nodules were found in 0/50 control females, 4/48 low-dose and 0/48 high-dose females.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.5X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates p-cresidine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase p-cresidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hrs. If released to soil, p-cresidine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 53. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in suspended solids and sediments due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. p-Cresidine reached 0.7% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using the Japanese MITI test, suggesting that biodegradation is not a fast environmental fate process. If released into water, p-cresidine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc but may bind strongly to humus and organic matter. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. This compound is expected to exist in the dissociated form in the environment and therefore volatilization of the cation from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. A BCF of <4.6 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to p-cresidine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where p-cresidine is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

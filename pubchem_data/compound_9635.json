ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /CFCs and HCFCs/",

The original Montreal Protocol was agreed on 16 September 1987 and entered into force on 1 January 1989. The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(v) and 2.125(e)(4)(iv) is effective December 31, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(iii) is effective June 30, 2011.

Additionally, since ozone-depleting substances persist in the air for long periods of time, the past use of these substances continues to affect the ozone layer today. We must also continue to ensure that the alternatives being brought to the market support the country's long-term environmental goals in a cost-effective manner.[EPA; Achievements in Stratospheric Ozone Protection Progress Report, Available from, as of March 11, 2013: http://www.epa.gov/ozone/downloads/spd-annual-report_final.pdf]",

If vomiting occurs, lean patient forward or place on left side (head-down position, if possible) to maintain an open airway and prevent aspiration. Keep patient quiet and maintain normal body temperature. Obtain medical attention. /Chlorinated fluorocarbons (CFCs) and related compounds/",

Death occasionally has been attributed to inhalant abuse, probably via the mechanism of cardiac arrhythmias, especially accompanying exercise or upper airway obstruction. /Fluorocarbon propellants/",

The human health risks are mainly confined to occasional high exposures that may occur during the handling of these substances. In contrast, indirect effects from the accumulation of these substances in the stratosphere may lead to substantial effects on human health, mainly due to the depletion of stratospheric ozone resulting in an increase in effects from UV-B radiation. The projected increase in the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers, a possible increase in melanoma skin cancers, and immunotoxic and ocular effects suggest that immediate action is required to reduce further stratospheric ozone depletion. /Halogenated chlorofluorocarbons/",

A review of the results of studies with these halogenated ethanes has revealed several consistencies between the pattern of halogen substitution and neoplastic responses in some affected organs. One of these consistencies was the finding of a modest increase in the incidence of renal tubule cell neoplasms in male rats administered penta- or hexachloroethane. Certain aspects of the nephropathy also noted in these studies resembled what is now recognized as a distinct hyaline droplet nephropathy typically associated with the accumulation of alpha2u-globulin in renal tubule cells. In an attempt to determine some of the structure activity relationships involved in the induction of hyaline droplet nephropathy by halogenated ethanes, a series of commercially available ethanes substituted with three or more chlorines, four or more bromines, or a combination of chlorines and fluorines was studied in a short-term renal toxicity assessment in male F344/N rats...Groups of five male rats were administered the vehicle (corn oil) or 0.62 or 1.24 mmol/kg 1,1,2,2-TC-1,2-DFE ... by gavage in a corn oil vehicle (5 mL/kg bod y weight) 7 days a week for 3 weeks. Additionally, five male and five female rats received the corn oil vehicle only, and five females designated as negative controls were administered 1.24 mmol/kg PCE...Necropsies were performed on all rats that survived to the end of the study and on four rat s administered 0.62 mmol/kg 1,1,2,2-TBE that died early. The right kidney, liver, and right testis were weighed...All male rats administered 1,1,1-TriC-2,2,2-TFE survived until the end of the study. The final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of dosed males were similar to those of the controls . There were no clinical signs of toxicity. There were no significant differences in organ weights or urinalysis parameters between dosed and control males. No microscopic effects attributable to 1,1,1-TriC-2,2,2-TFE administration were present in either the kidney or the liver at either dose level. PCNA staining was not performed due to the absence of a detectable treatment effect in routine sections.",

The compound is often present in low levels in CFC113. Fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), such as 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane, were scheduled for production phase-out in 1987 by the Montreal Protocol. If released to air, a measured vapor pressure of 360 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates that 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane is essentially inert to reaction with photochemically generated radicals and ozone molecules. 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to undergo direct photolysis by sunlight in the troposphere. Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine. These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer. If released to soil, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.27 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 51 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.27 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 51(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 3.09(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2012).",

Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine. These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer(3,5,6). By analogy to other Freon compounds, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane is predicted to have a stratospheric lifetime on the order of several decades(7).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

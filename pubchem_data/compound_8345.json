PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.2X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bis(2-butoxyethyl) phthalate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase bis(2-butoxyethyl) phthalate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.1 hours. Bis(2-butoxyethyl) phthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, bis(2-butoxyethyl) phthalate is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 170. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation studies using a series of commercial phthalate esters and acclimated inoculum have demonstrated that in general, phthalate esters may be susceptible to biodegradation. If released into water, bis(2-butoxyethyl) phthalate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 27 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 1.3 years and 49 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to bis(2-butoxyethyl) phthalate may occur through inhalation of aerosols and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bis(2-butoxyethyl) phthalate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to bis(2-butoxyethyl) phthalate via products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Biodegradation studies using a series of commercial phthalate esters and acclimated inoculum have demonstrated that in general, phthalate esters may be susceptible to biodegradation(2). A proposed pathway is via enzymatic ester hydrolysis to form the monoester and corresponding alcohol; further enzymatic degradation of the monoester proceeds via phthalic acid to procatechuate, ultimately yielding acetyl CoA and succinate(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

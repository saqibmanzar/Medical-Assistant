When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Remember that atropine can be administered through an endotracheal tube if initial IV access if difficult to obtain. Depending on the severity of poisoning, doses of atropine ranging from very low to ...high ...may be required, or even continuous infusion. The objective of atropine antidotal therapy is to antagonize the effects of excessive concentrations of acetylcholine at end-organs having muscarinic receptors. Atropine does not reactivate the cholinesterase enzyme or accelerate disposition of organophosphate. Recrudescence of poisoning may occur if tissue concentrations of organophosphate remain high when the effect of atropine wears off. Atropine is effective against muscarinic manifestations, but it is ineffective against nicotinic actions, specifically muscle weakness and twitching, and respiratory depression. Despite the limitations, atropine is often a life-saving agent in organophosphate poisonings. Favorable response to a test dose of atropine... can help differentiate poisoning by anticholinesterase agents from other conditions. However, lack of response, with no evidence of atropinization (atropine refractoriness) is typical of more severe poisonings. The adjunctive use of nebulized atropine has been reported to improve respiratory distress, decrease bronchial secretions, and increase oxygenation. ...Do not administer atropine or pralidoxime prophylactically to workers exposed to organophosphate pesticides. Prophylactic dosage with either atropine or pralidoxime may mask early signs and symptoms of organophosphate poisoning and thus allow the worker to continue exposure and possibly progress to more severe poisoning. Atropine itself may enhance the health hazards of the agricultural work setting: impaired heat loss due to reduced sweating and impaired ability to operate mechanical equipment due to blurred vision. This can be caused by mydriasis, one of the effects of atropine. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

Ampules of... glycopyrolate were added to ...saline and this infusion was titrated to the desired effects of dry mucous membranes and heart rate above 60 beats/min. During this study, atropine was used as a bolus for a heart rate less than 60 beats/min. The other apparent advantage to this regimen was a decreased number of respiratory infections. This may represent an alternative when there is a concern for respiratory infection due to excessive and difficult to control secretions, and in the presence of altered level of consciousness where the distinction between atropine toxicity or relapse of organophosphate poisoning is unclear. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

Before administration of pralidoxime, draw a blood sample (heparinized) for cholinesterase analysis (since pralidoxime tends to reverse the cholinesterase depression). Administration pralidoxime (Protopam, 2-PAM), a cholinesterase reactivator, in cases of severe poisoning by organophosphate pesticides in which respiratory depression, muscle weakness, and/or twitching are severe. When administered early (usually less than 48 hours after poisoning) pralidoxime relieves the nicotinic as well as the muscarinic effects of poisoning. Pralidoxime works by reactivating the cholinesterase and also by slowing the \"aging\" process of phosphorylated cholinesterase to a non-reactivatable form. ... Dosage of pralidoxime may be repeated in 1-2 hours, then at 10-12 hour intervals if needed. In very severe poisonings, dosage rates may be doubled. Repeated doses of pralidoxime are usually required. In cases that involve continuing absorption of organophosphate (as after ingestion of large amounts), or continuing transfer of highly lipophilic organophosphate from fat into blood, it may be necessary to continue administration of pralidoxime for several days beyond the 48 hour post-exposure interval usually cited as the limit of its effectiveness. ... Blood pressure should be monitored during administration because of the occasional occurrence of hypertensive crisis. Administration should be slowed or stopped if blood pressure rises to hazardous levels. Be prepared to assist pulmonary ventilation mechanically if respiration is depressed during or after pralidoxime administration. If intravenous injection is not possible, pralidoxime may be given by deep intramuscular injection. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

If the average of several pre-exposure values were available, then a decrease of 17% would be significant. It has been recommended that, if measured activity is reduced by 30% or more of the pre-exposure value, AChE measurements should be repeated at appropriate intervals to confirm the results. Depressions of AChE or ChE in excess of 20-25% are considered diagnostic of exposure but not, necessarily, indicative of hazard. Depressions of 30-50% or more are considered indicators for removal of an exposed individual from further contact with pesticides until levels return to normal. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/"

Advances in gas chromatography and combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) have made it possible to analyse the urine of exposed persons for the presence of appropriate metabolites. It is usually necessary to preserve the sample by the addition of chloroform, to concentrate or extract the metabolite(s), and to convert them to suitably-volatile derivatives that can be detected by GC. Obviously, access to a well-equipped analytical laboratory, capable of the quick processing of samples, is a necessary factor if monitoring by urine analysis is proposed. However, in some cases, simpler and sensitive colorimetric tests are available for screening the urine of exposed persons. Thus, 4-nitrophenol can be measured directly in the urine of workers exposed to parathion. Consideration of the concentration of metabolite(s) in the urine can be helpful in determining patterns of exposure, and these concentrations can be calibrated against the effects on AChE for a particular pesticide. However, the time-course and peak of excretion of metabolites appears to vary according to dose, so that serial sampling and analyses of urine are desirable. Levels of metabolite alone cannot be considered a guide to hazard. This is obvious when it is realized that pesticides that have very different toxicities may yield identical acidic metabolites. Thus, the level of metabolites in urine, after exposure to sufficient amounts of the very toxic parathion-methyl to depress blood-AChE to 50%, will be much lower than that of the identical metabolites, following exposure to the related fenitrothion, which is about 40 times less toxic. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/",

(From a graph presented in the study, an intramuscular dose of about 0.5 mg (about 0.007 mg/kg) reduced plasma cholinesterase and RBC acetylcholinesterase to about 20% and 75% of control, respectively.) Thus, a no-effect-level for RBC acetylcholinesterase inhibition following intramuscular administration is probably <0.007 mg/kg. Maximum depression of plasma cholinesterase occurred within 1 hr of dosing, and the maximum depression of RBC acetylcholinesterase occurred within 2 hr of dosing, regardless of the route of administration. Overt cholinergic symptoms (anorexia, vomiting, sweating, salivation, giddiness, uneasiness, headache, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, etc.) occurred after a single parenteral dose of 5 mg, after 3.6 mg for 2 days, or after 2.4 mg for 3 days. Similar results were obtained following oral dosing of 7.2 mg every 3 hours, 3-5 times. When symptoms appeared, they usually began suddenly about 30 minutes after the last dose of TEPP."

The potency of NaF in restoring transmission is less than that of P-2-AM, the effect of 0.02 mM NaF being equivalent to that of 0.001 mM P-2-AM. The analysis of end-plate potential indicates that the restoration of transmission is due to the dual actions of fluoride, namely, (1) sensitization of end-plate membrane and (2) reactivation of phosphorylated ChE. A similar conclusion is obtained from the analysis of the effects of TEPP and Sarin as well as of NaF on the post-synaptic potential of frog's sympathetic ganglion cell. A similar effect of NaF is also demonstrated with regard to Renshaw cell activity of cat's spinal cord.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.60X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tetraethyl pyrophosphate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase tetraethyl pyrophosphate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.0 hours. If released to soil, tetraethyl pyrophosphate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2.2. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Tetraethyl pyrophosphate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, tetraethyl pyrophosphate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation data for this substance were not located in the literature. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis half-lives for this substance have been measured to be 6.8 and 7.5 hours at 25 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since tetraethyl pyrophosphate is no longer produced or used. In the past, tetraethyl pyrophosphate was applied directly to crops as an insecticide and exposure to this compound was primarily by loading crop duster airplanes and application to fields. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

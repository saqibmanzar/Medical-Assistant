PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The hydroxylation rate for 1-dodecanol was much lower than that for lauric acid. Both NADPH and O2 were required for hydroxylation activity. NADH had no effect on the hydroxylation. The hydroxylating system was inhibited 49% by CO at a CO:O2 ratio of 4.0. The formation of omega-hydroxydodecanol was more sharply inhibited by CO than was the formation of (omega-1)-hydroxydodecanol, implying that more than one cytochrome P-450 was involved in the hydroxylation of 1-dodecanol and that CO has a higher affinity for the P-450 catalyzing the omega-hydroxylation. The formation of laurate during the incubation of 1-dodecanol with frog liver microsomes suggests that a fatty alcohol oxidation system is also present in the microsomes. NAD+ was the most effective cofactor for the oxidation of 1-dodecanol and NADP+ had a little effect. Pyrazole (an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase) had a slight inhibitory effect on the oxidation and sodium azide (an inhibitor of catalase) had no effect.",

Lauric acid was hydroxylated most effectively among saturated fatty acids and the order of activity as hydroxylation substrates was C12 greater than C14 greater than C13 greater than C16 greater than C10 greater than C18 greater than C8. The specific activity of laurate hydroxylation (5.99 nmol/mg microsomal protein/min) in gerbil liver microsomes was higher than that observed in other species. 1-Dodecanol was also hydroxylated very effectively (4.58 nmol/mg microsomal protein/min) by gerbil liver microsomes, but in general the hydroxylation rates for fatty alcohols were much lower than those for the corresponding acids.",

The Agency has completed its review of these generic data, and has determined that the data are sufficient to support reregistration of all products containing aliphatic alcohols (C6 - C16). The Agency has completed its assessment of the human health and ecological risks associated with the use of pesticide products containing aliphatic alcohols (C6 - C16). The Agency has determined that aliphatic alcohol-containing products are eligible for reregistration provided that label amendments are made as outlined in Chapter V. ... The Agency has identified eye-irritation concerns that warrant specific label language concerning personal protective equipment (PPE) and the length of restricted-entry intervals after application for tobacco uses of the aliphatic alcohols (C6 - C16). If all changes outlined in this document are incorporated into the product labels, the eye-irritation concerns will have been mitigated.

Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the  effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for  human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than  those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List  D.

It is also used in synthetic detergents, lube additives, pharmaceuticals, rubber, textiles, perfumes, and as a flavoring agent.  The substance is practically non-toxic, and is a permitted food additive (GRAS) in both the U.S. and the EU.  It is registered for pesticide use in the U.S. but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY:  Contact for 48 hours with 4% 1-dodecanol in petrolatum was not irritating to 25 human volunteers, but marked skin irritation was noted when 25% 1-dodecanol in mineral oil was given in open contact with scarified skin of 5 to 10 volunteers once a day for 3 days. There was no skin sensitization in 25 human volunteers at a concentration of 4% in petrolatum.  ANIMAL STUDIES:  Aspiration of 0.2 mL of 1-dodecanol produced death among 9 out of 10 rats.  The deaths were caused by pulmonary edema rather than cardiac arrest or respiratory failure as with the C3 to C10 alcohols.  The lungs were dark red; seven rats died within 7 to 30 min, and two rats died 5 hr or longer after dosing.  1-Dodecanol did not cause developmental or reproductive toxicities when tested in rats at concentrations of 0, 100, 500, 2000 mg/kg /day for 14 days prior to mating.  1-Dodecanol, in the doses administered, had no effect on fetal weight, weight gain, food consumption, and food efficiency in the parental generation.  When tested for carcinogenicity, 1-dodecanol showed weak tumor-promoting activity when applied three times a week for 60 weeks to the skin of mice that had previously received an initiating dose of dimethylbenz[a]anthracene.  In another study, in 6-8 week old mice, ip injections of dodecanol in 0.1 mL tricaprylin (12.0 g/kg to 30 animals in high dose group, and 2.4 g/kg to 28 animals in low dose group)  was administered 3 times weekly for eight weeks.  Papillomas developed in 2 of 30 mice after 39 and 49 weeks of treatment.  Lung tumors were observed in 2/15 female mice in the high dose group, and in 2/15 males and 3/13 females in the low dose group.  1-Dodecanol was not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium in the Ames assay with and without metabolic activation, or to Escherichia coli without metabolic activation.  However, it diminished cell mitotic activity and caused structural changes to chromosomes and the mitotic apparatus in Vicia faba after 14 hours exposure.  ECOTOXICITY: Although Dodecanol exhibits non-polar CNS depressant toxicity to aquatic organisms of about 1 mg/L, the substance is readily degradable and releases during production, or through diffuse uses of the free alcohol do not give rise to environmental concerns.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 8.48X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-dodecanol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-dodecanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hours. 1-Dodecanol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-dodecanol is expected to have slight mobility based upon Koc values of 2042-3388 in humic acid. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon a estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.19X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Theoretical BOD values using standard 5-day aerobic sewage tests ranged from 20-29.7% indicate that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 1-dodecanol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon a Koc of 7700 measured in suspended solids. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 27 hours and 12 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 11 months when adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 48 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1-dodecanol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-dodecanol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-dodecanol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 1-dodecanol.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.19X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 27 hours and 12 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 11 months when adsorption is considered(5). 1-Dodecanol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 48(SRC), from its log Kow of 5.13(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Theoretical BOD values, using standard 5-day aerobic sewage tests ranged from 20-29.7%(9-11), indicate that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 27 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 12 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 11 months when adsorption is considered(3). 1-Dodecanol's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 1-Dodecanol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 8.48X10-4 mm Hg(4).",

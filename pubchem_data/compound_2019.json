PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

X-ray studies of a crystalline complex between dactinomycin and deoxyguanosine permitted formulation of a model that appears to explain the binding of the drug to DNA. The planar phenoxazone ring intercalates between adjacent guanine-cytosine base pairs of DNA, while the polypeptide chains extend along the minor groove of the helix. The summation of these interactions provides great stability to the dactinomycin-DNA complex, and as a result of the binding of dactinomycin, the transcription of DNA by RNA polymerase is blocked. The DNA-dependent RNA polymerases are much more sensitive to the effects of dactinomycin than are the DNA polymerases. In addition, dactinomycin causes single-strand breaks in DNA, possibly through a free-radical intermediate or as a result of the action of topoisomerase II",

Cellular mitochondrial oxygen consumption (measured by a homemade phosphorescence analyzer) and ATP content (measured by the luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence system) were determined as functions of time t during continuous exposure to the drug. The rate of respiration, k, was the negative of the slope of [O2] versus t. Oxygen consumption and ATP content were diminished by cyanide, confirming that both processes involved oxidations in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In the presence of dactinomycin, k decreased gradually with t, the decrease being more pronounced at higher drug concentrations. Cellular ATP remained constant for 5 h in untreated cells, but in the presence of 20 microM dactinomycin it decreased gradually (to one-tenth the value at 5 h for untreated cells). The drug-induced inhibition of respiration and decrease in ATP were blocked by the pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk). A rapid but temporary decrease in cellular ATP observed on the addition of zVAD-fmk was shown to be due to DMSO (added with zVAD-fmk). The effect of dactinomycin on respiration differed from that of doxorubicin. Plots of [O2] versus t were curved for dactinomycin so that k decreased gradually with t. The corresponding plots for doxorubicin were well fit by two straight lines; so k was constant for approximately 150 min, at which time k decreased, remaining constant at a lower level thereafter. The results for cells treated with mixtures of the two drugs indicated that the drugs acted synergistically. These results show the onset and severity of mitochondrial dysfunction in cells undergoing apoptosis induced by dactinomycin.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

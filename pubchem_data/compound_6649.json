PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The concentrations chosen to be scored for the activated assay were neat and 1:2 and 1:4 dilutions of the test extract. The results indicate that the test substance did not cause a statistically significant increase in the number of chromosome aberrations (p < 0.05). This was observed for both activated and non-activated system. In addition, there was no detectable dose response in the number of aberrations of both activated and non-activated systems, verifying the validy of the test system. In conclusion, the test substance did not induce aberrations in primary cultured human lymphocytes and is considered non-clastogenic."

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.91X10-11 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates p,p'-oxybis(benzenesulfonyl hydrazide) will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase p,p'-oxybis(benzenesulfonyl hydrazide) will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. p,p'-Oxybis(benzenesulfonyl hydrazide) does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, p,p'-oxybis(benzenesulfonyl hydrazide) is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 880. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.26X10-17 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, p,p'-oxybis(benzenesulfonyl hydrazide) is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 2% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. BCF values of less than 3.0 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to p,p'-oxybis(benzenesulfonyl hydrazide) may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where p,p'-oxybis(benzenesulfonyl hydrazide) is produced or used. Exposure to the general population is limited. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

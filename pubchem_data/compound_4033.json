It is a vesicant and necrotizing irritant destructive to mucous membranes. It was formerly used as a war gas. The hydrochloride is used as an antineoplastic in Hodgkin's disease and lymphomas. It causes severe gastrointestinal and bone marrow damage. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations. Mechlorethamine is cell cycle phase-nonspecific.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

To explore the mechanism of HN2-induced apoptosis, we utilized ebselen, a selenoorganic compound with potent antioxidant activity. We examined whether ebselen would inhibit apoptosis in BALB/c mouse spleen lymphocytes and human MOLT-4 leukemia cells treated with HN2 (2.5 microM) in vitro. Non-toxic concentrations (<50 microM) of ebselen were found to prevent HN2-induced apoptosis of murine lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by cell viability, hypodiploid DNA formation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. However, ebselen was ineffective at preventing spontaneous apoptosis in these cells, pointing to the selectivity of its action. Furthermore, pretreatment with ebselen at 1-10 microM for 72 hr protected MOLT-4 cells from HN2-induced apoptosis and maintained cell viability and proliferation as monitored by the above-mentioned parameters. This was accompanied by the preservation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and elevated glutathione levels and by a blockage of caspase-3 and -9 activation. In vivo, ebselen also had a marked protective effect against spleen weight loss associated with lymphocyte apoptosis in mice treated by HN2. Therefore, ebselen provides an efficient protection against HN2-induced cell death in normal and tumoral lymphocytes and might prove useful as an antidote against alkylating agents.",

At concentrations where 50% of the consensus sequence DNA contained at least one lesion, HN2 inhibited formation of the Sp1 complex by 37% (40 microM HN2) and the AP2 complex by 40% (50 microM HN2). The binding of the TATA binding protein (TBP) to the TATA element was also inhibited by HN2, whereas sulphur mustard and the monofunctional sulphur mustard 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulphide (CEES) resulted in a disproportional extent of inhibition with respect to the level of alkylation. The level of alkylation of the TBP oligonucleotide varied significantly at 100 microM drug, with 80, 42 and 15% of HN2, sulphur mustard and CEES, respectively. However, this level of alkylation inhibited formation of the TBP-DNA complex by 70, 70 and 45%, respectively. This differential sensitivity of transcription factors to mustard-induced DNA damage therefore appears to reside dominantly in the stereochemical differences between the specific mustard lesions.",

HN2 caused a concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis on C3H murine spleen cells, as identified by two criteria: morphological features revealed by microscopical observations and DNA fragmentation visualized by the characteristic \"ladder\" pattern observed upon agarose gel electrophoresis, as well as by hypodiploid DNA-containing cells revealed by the flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide labelled cells. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was found to markedly reduce the occurrence of HN2-induced apoptosis in these cells. This protective effect will still obtained when NAC was added 30 min after HN2. In contrast, the pretreatment of spleen cells with this antioxidant did not provide any significant protection. We also showed that lymphocytes protected by NAC are still able to respond to a mitogenic stimulation. To gain some insight into the mechanisms underlying the cytoprotective action of NAC against HN2, we tested whether or not poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP, EC 2.4.2.30), a nuclear enzyme that participates in the triggering of apoptosis induced by alkylating agents, is involved. We report that 6(5H)-phenanthridinone, a potent PARP inhibitor, did not affect the ability of NAC to prevent HN2-induced apoptosis under our experimental conditions. Thus, the exact mechanism by which NAC protects lymphocytes from HN2 cytotoxicity has yet to be determined.",

The properties of nitrogen mustards are only slightly different from those of sulfur mustards, another major class of blister agents. However, exposure to nitrogen mustards may be more immediately toxic than exposure to sulfur mustard. Nitrogen mustards are alkylating agents that affect DNA and other molecules in the body. Exposure to nitrogen mustard damages the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and suppresses the immune system. Although the nitrogen mustards cause cellular changes within minutes of contact, the onset of pain and other symptoms is delayed. Exposure to large amounts can be fatal. HN-2 has a fruity odor at high concentrations, and a soapy or fishy odor at low concentrations.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

The vacuum bag should be removed and discarded or cleaned, and the exterior of the vacuum cleaner should be washed with detergent and rinsed before being covered and stored. The contaminated powder should be discarded into a sealable plastic bag and segregated with other contaminated waste materials. Alternatively, inexpensive wet or dry vacuum units may be purchased for this express use and used with appropriate cleaners. All such units are contaminated, once used, and must be cleaned, stored, and ultimately discarded /properly/ ... The circumstances and handling of spills should be documented.

Depending on the persistence of the agent and the potential for condensation of agent from the cloud, evacuation of the threatened population after passage of the initial cloud may be appropriate. /Vesicants- Nitrogen Based/",

To be effective, decontamination must be completed within one minute of exposure. However, to prevent systemic toxicity, decontamination should be done as late as 2 or 3 hours after exposure even if it increases the severity of the local reaction. In all cases, clothing should be removed because it may contain \"trapped\" liquid or vapor. Small Areas: Puddles of liquid must be contained by covering with vermiculite, diatomaceous earth, clay, fine sand, sponges, paper towels or cloth towels. Remove all material and place in a container. Decontaminate the area with copious amounts of household bleach. A 10 weight percent HTH/water slurry may be substituted for the bleach solution. Removal of porous material, including painted surfaces, that may have absorbed Vesicant liquid may be required as these materials could continue to re-release vapor after exposure has ceased. Surfaces contaminated with Vesicants then only rinsed may still evolve sufficient agent vapor to produce a physiological response. /Vesicants- Nitrogen Based/",

Vesicants cause inflammation, blisters, and general destruction of tissues. Vapors have a greater impact on moist areas of the body. Eyes are especially susceptible to vesicants. Inhalation of Vesicants can cause lung membranes to swell and become filled with liquid (pulmonary edema). Death may result from lack of oxygen. Vesicants are also systemic agents and readily pass through the skin to affect susceptible tissue including those that produce blood. Nitrogen Vesicants should be considered carcinogenic. Pathways: Vesicants are hazardous through inhalation, skin and eye exposure, ingestion, and abraded skin (e.g., breaks in the skin or penetration of skin by debris). /Vesicants- Nitrogen Based/",

Candidate molecules were chosen on the basis of the known cytotoxicity mechanisms of mustards or their efficacy previously observed on other cellular models. It included the sulfhydryl-containing molecules N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and WR-1065, the nucleophile hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), the energy-level stabilizer niacinamide (NC), the antioxidant dimethylthiourea (DMTU), L-arginine analogues such as L-thiocitrulline (L-TC) and L-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and the anti-gelatinase doxycycline (DOX). Their efficacy was determined using 2-(4-[3-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2, 4-disulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium (WST-1) reduction by viable cells 24 h after initial exposure to 100 microM HN2 or SM. On individual immediate cotreatment, some molecules exhibited selective protection against only one mustard, such as DMTU and WR-1065 against HN2 and DOX against SM, whereas NAC and L-TC were effective against both SM and HN2 cytotoxicity. However, as the level of protection against SM was always weak compared to HN2, several combinations were investigated against SM to improve the protection. The effective combinations (L-TC + DOX, NAC + DOX, NAC + DMTU, NAC + HMT, NC + DOX) combined agents, reducing the bioavailability of the mustard with compounds possibly acting on the consequences of alkylation. One of these combinations, NAC + DOX, appeared to be the most interesting, as these agents are already used in human therapy. It exhibited good efficacy in delayed cotreatment (up to 90 min) against SM.",

The compounds examined included inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), sulfhydryl-group donors as nucleophiles, and iron chelators and inhibitors of lipid peroxidation as antioxidants. Their effectiveness was determined upon observance of metabolic dysfunction induced by HN2 following a 4-hr  exposure, using (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction and ATP-level assays as indicators. Moreover, the fluorescent probe, monobromobimane (mBBr), and 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (H2DCF-DA) were used to assess intracellular sulfhydryl and peroxide level modifications by flow cytometry, respectively, following a 3-h exposure. Cell death was assessed by flow cytometry using the propidium iodide (PI)-dye-exclusion assay following 24-hr exposure. PARP inhibitors (niacinamide, 3-aminobenzamide, 6(5H)-phenanthridinone), and two sulfhydryl-group donors (N-acetylcysteine, WR-1065) were found to be effective in preventing HN2-induced metabolic dysfunction when added in immediate or delayed treatment with HN2. Only N-acetylcysteine, however, was found to prevent cell death induced by HN2, though it must be present at the time of the HN2 challenge.",

Later decontamination is not likely to improve the victim's condition but will protect other personnel from exposure. ...The eyes and skin must be decontaminated within 1 or 2 minutes after exposure to reduce tissue damage. Flush the eyes immediately with water for about 5-10 min by tilting the head to the side, pulling eyelids apart with fingers, and pouring water slowly into eyes. Do not cover eyes with bandages. If exposure to liquid agent is suspected, cut and remove all clothing and wash skin immediately with soap and water. If shower areas are available, showering with water alone will be adequate. However, in those cases where water is in short supply, and showers are not available, an alternative form of decontamination is to use 05% sodium hypochlorite solution or absorbent powders such as fluor, talcum powder, or Fuller's earth. If exposure to vapor only is certain, remove outer clothing and wash exposed areas with soap and water or 0.5% solution of sodium hypochlorite. Place contaminated clothes and personal belongings in a seal double bag. In cases of ingestion, DO NOT INDUCE EMESIS. There is no evidence that administration of activated charcoal is beneficial. ...If the victim is alert and able to swallow, give 4 to 8 ounces of milk or water to drink. /Nitrogen mustards/",

A group of patients, including 14 children and teenagers, exposed to mustard gas were studied. Laboratory tests including blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, urine analysis, etc., were determined. Among the most frequent disorders were facial involvement (78%), which dominated the clinical picture, followed by genital (42%), truncal, and axillary lesions (both 14%). Eosinophilia was the most prominent laboratory disorder seen in 12% of the patients. Skin lesions started 4-18 hours after exposure. Erythema developed within 20-30 hours after exposure, followed by blisters. The time of onset of manifestations had been shorter and severity of the lesions higher in children and teenagers compared with adults. Both phenomena could be attributed to the more delicate skin of the young patients. Genital manifestations were less frequent in this subgroup while ophthalmic, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal lesions were more frequently encountered in children than in adults. /Unspecified mustard gas/"

Cells were synchronized in Gl/S, treated with nitrogen mustard, and then postincubated with pentoxifylline. Nitrogen mustard-induced a protracted delay in G2 phase. This delay correlated with suppression of cyclin Bl- and cdc2-kinase activities, and stabilization of hyperphosphorylated-cdc2 in the presence of similar cyclin Bl levels to those found in mitosis. Nitrogen mustard had no discernible effect on the S phase activity of cyclin A- or cdk2-immune complexes. Entry of control cells into mitosis correlated with destruction of cyclin A, disappearance of cyclin A-bound cdk2 and decreased cdk2 kinase activity. G2 delay induced by nitrogen mustard was associated with stabilization of cyclin A, increased abundance of cyclin A-bound cdk2, and increased cdk2 activity. Cyclin A was also associated with cdc2, which, contrary to complexes containing cdk2, were only activated upon entry into mitosis. Pentoxifylline abrogated cell cycle arrest induced by aphidicolin and nitrogen mustard in human lymphoma cells. Pentoxifylline also reverted the activity of cyclin A- and Bl-kinases in nitrogen mustard-treated cells to approximately that observed in controls. Delayed entry into mitosis following DNA damage correlates with suppression of cyclin B1/cdc2 and cyclin A/cdc2 complexes, while maintaining cyclin A/cdc2 complexes in an active state. Furthermore, pentoxifylline disrupts the signal transduction pathway that regulates these complexes when damaged DNA is present, resulting ln abrogation of cell cycle arrest.",

Twice weekly applications of HN2 produced tumors in 34% of the mice. In addition, the HN2 treatments plus UVB radiation resulted in a significant acceleration in tumor formation as compared to either carcinogenic stimulus alone. The twice weekly application of HN2 plus UVB exposure was more tumorigenic than UVB plus HN2 applied once a week. Thus a positive carcinogenic dose response was noted. No tumor-suppressing effects were detected in this study.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.17 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates mechlorethamine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase mechlorethamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Mechlorethamine does not contain any functional groups that would be expected to absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm, and it would not be expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. The hydrolysis of mechlorethamine is generally described as rapid and hydrolysis is expected to be the predominate environmental fate of mechlorethamine. A hydrolysis half-life of 11 hours was reported for mechlorethamine in a 66.7% acetone-water solution at 25 \u00b0C, and would be expected to be more rapid in a solution with just water as the solvent. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected based upon its vapor pressure. Bioconcentration is not likely be an important environmental fate due to mechlorethamine's rapid hydrolysis.  Occupational exposure to mechlorethamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where mechlorethamine is produced or used. The general population is unlikely to be exposed to mechlorethamine due to its limited use as a chemotherapeutic agent. (SRC)",

A hydrolysis half-life of 11 hours was reported for mechlorethamine in a 66.7% acetone-water solution at 25 \u00b0C(3), and would be expected to be more rapid in a solution with just water as the solvent(SRC). The predominate environmental fate of mechlorethamine is expected to be hydrolysis and therefore bioconcentration is not expected to be an important environmental fate process(SRC). The hydrolysis of mechlorethamine may be limited by its rate of dissolution(SRC) as is seen for a related compound, bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide (mustard gas)(4).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Mechlorethamine does not contain any functional groups that would be expected to absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm, and it would not be expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). The hydrolysis of mechlorethamine is generally described as rapid(2,3); however, only limited quantitative data were located(SRC). In water, nitrogen mustards, including mechlorethamine, form cyclic imonium ions, releasing chloride ion; the cyclic imonium ion of mechlorethamine can then react with water(4). In 66.7% acetone-water solution at 25 \u00b0C and uncontrolled pH, the psuedo-unimolecular rate constant for the hydrolysis of mechlorethamine was reported as 0.001 min-1(4), corresponding to a half-life of 11 hours(SRC). In a solution with just water as the solvent, hydrolysis of mechlorethamine would be expected to be more rapid(SRC). The hydrolysis of mechlorethamine may be limited by its rate of dissolution(SRC) as is seen for a related compound, bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide (mustard gas)(5).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

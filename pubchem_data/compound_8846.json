Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Subgroups of three animals per dose were killed at various intervals between 15 minutes and 3 days after dosing. Butyl acrylate was rapidly delivered to all major tissues; peak concentrations were seen at or before 15 minutes in all tissues except adipose tissue. There was a rapid initial decrease in radioactivity in all major tissues, except adipose tissue, during the first 2 hours after dosing; the elimination slowed to a negligible rate and remained relatively constant between 2 hours and 3 days after dosing. Fifteen minutes after dosing, 154.3, 98.6, and 51.4 ug/g radioactivity was found in the kidneys, liver, and blood, respectively; the amounts found in the liver, kidneys, and blood were 86.0, 78.7, and 27.0 ug/g, respectively, after 45 minutes; 53.5, 33.7, and 18.5 ug/g, respectively, after 2 hours; and 45.0, 23.0, and 19.8 ug/g, respectively, after 6 hours. (The radioactivity concentration in adipose tissue at 15 minutes, 45 minutes, 2 hours, and 6 hours was 10.8, 10.6, 8.5, and 14.0 ug/g, respectively.) The majority of the dose was excreted in CO2. After 24 hours, 45.3% of the dose was excreted in expired air and 15.6% was excreted in the urine. The greatest amount of radioactivity was found in the adipose tissue, muscle, and skin at this time (12.2%, 5.2%, and 2.7% of the dose, respectively).",

After oral administration, n-butyl acrylate was very rapidly absorbed and hydrolyzed to acrylic acid, with more than 75% of the dose eliminated as its metabolic end product (14)CO2. Some 10% of the dose was excreted in the urine, two metabolites being identified as the mercapturic acid N-acetyl-S-(2-carboxyethyl)cysteine and its sulfoxide. The elimination pattern of (14)C was essentially identical at all doses, but additional unidentified (14)C peaks were present in the urine at 400 mg/kg. Comparison of the data from the two routes of administration suggested that n-butyl acrylate exhibited a first-pass effect after oral dosing, but this was not investigated further. n-Butyl acrylate was rapidly and extensively excreted, the tissues being cleared of (14)C by 24-72 hr. After an initial rapid reduction, a small amount of (14)C was retained in whole blood and adipose tissue, possibly by incorporation of (14)C via the one-carbon pool. These findings were confirmed ... using (13)C-labelled n-butyl acrylate with nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. These authors also found a significant enrichment of (13)C in 3-hydroxypropanoic acid in the urine of rats and, when esterase activity was inhibited with tri-o-tolyl phosphate, a third mercapturic acid, N-acetyl-S-(butoxycarbonylethyl)cysteine, was found. This is derived from the reverse Michael addition of glutathione across the alpha,beta-unsaturated bond of n-butyl acrylate. In further work, ... slight increases /were reported/ in the amounts of lactic and acetic acids in rat urine after administration of n-butyl acrylate.",

A slight increase in the excretion of lactic acid (p < 0.10) was also found in animals exposed to ethyl and 1-butyl acrylates. Two mercapturic acids, N-acetyl-S-(2-carboxyethyl)cysteine and the corresponding N-acetyl-S-[(2-alkoxycarbonyl)ethyl]cysteine were formed from both acrylate esters ... For ethyl acrylate the conversion to mercapturic acids amounted to 11% of the administered dose, whereas for 1-butyl acrylate the corresponding conjugates decreased from 3.6% at 0.5 mmol/kg to 1.6% at 3.0 mmol/kg.

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Gavage administration of equimolar doses (2 mmol/kg) of methyl or ethyl acrylate in corn oil resulted in profound gastric toxicity in male F344 rats, while acrylic acid and n-butyl acrylate were without effect. Furthermore, gavage administration of equimolar doses of methyl propionate or ethyl propionate (saturated analogues of methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate, respectively) as well as methacrylic acid esters were without gastric toxicity. These results indicate that structural requirements for acrylate esters to cause gastric lesions include an intact ester moiety, a double bond, and no substitution at carbon number 2. Additional studies indicate that gastric toxicity may be attributed to the intact ester molecule or to metabolite(s) other than products of carboxylesterase-mediated hydrolysis (acrylic acid and alcohol) and that gastric toxicity is dependent upon both acrylate ester concentration in dose vehicle and the lipophilicity of the dose vehicle (corn oil vs water).",

The objectives of these studies were to determine the irritating and sensitizing potential of these three compounds using an irritation assay, the murine Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA), and the Mouse Ear Swelling Test (MEST). The minimal irritating concentration for TMT was determined to be 1.0%, whereas BAC and EAC demonstrated no irritation up to 30%, the highest concentration tested. TMT tested positive in the LLNA at concentrations as low as 0.1% whereas an induction concentration of 0.3% was required to elicit a positive response in the MEST. Furthermore, BAC tested negative in the MEST at induction concentrations as high as 30%, but yielded positive results in the LLNA at concentrations as low as 20%. EAC, at all concentrations tested, was negative in both the MEST and the LLNA. Cross reactivity was only seen when mice were sensitized with TMT and challenged with BAC. In these studies, the LLNA was a more sensitive indicator of the allergic potential of these three acrylates when compared to the MEST.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.45 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-butyl acrylate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-butyl acrylate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 28 hours and 7 days, respectively. Experimental photodegradation first-order rate constants in distilled water, river water, artificial seawater, and seawater of 5.7X10-4, 5.9X10-4, 4.7X10-4, and 4.1X10-4/sec, respectively, which correspond to half-lives of 20 min, 19 min, 25 min, and 28 min, respectively, suggest that n-butyl acrylate may be susceptible to direct photolysis in sunlight. If released to soil, n-butyl acrylate is expected to have very high to high mobility based upon Koc values of 40-148. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.6X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. n-Butyl acrylate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 61.3% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, n-butyl acrylate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 17 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 11 and 1.1 years at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to n-butyl acrylate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-butyl acrylate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-butyl acrylate via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with products emitting n-butyl acrylate. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an  estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.6X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from  its vapor pressure, 5.45 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 2,000 mg/L(5). Using  this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 5 days,  respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF  of 17(SRC), from its log Kow of 2.36(7) and a regression-derived equation(8),  suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process(SRC) based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 11 and 1.1 years at pHs 7 and 8, respectively(9). n-Butyl acrylate has experimental aquatic first-order photochemical degradation rates of 5.7X10-4, 5.9X10-4, 4.7X10-4, and 4.1X10-4/sec in distilled water, river  water, artificial seawater, and seawater, respectively(10), corresponding to half-lives of 20 min, 19 min, 25 min, and 28 min, respectively(SRC). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 61.3% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks(11), suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase n-butyl acrylate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 28 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.4X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Vapor-phase n-butyl acrylate is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.8X10-18 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that n-butyl acrylate is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). n-Butyl acrylate's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of n-butyl acrylate from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

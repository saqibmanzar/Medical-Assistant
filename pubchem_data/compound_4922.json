Upon oral administration, proglumide binds to and blocks both cholecystokinin receptor type A (CCK-AR; CCK1-R) and gastrin/cholecystokinin type B receptor (CCK-BR; CCK2-R). This prevents the binding of cholecystokinin and gastrin to the CCK receptors, and inhibits both gastrointestinal (GI) motility and gastric secretions. This may also decrease fibrosis in the tumor microenvironment (TME), increase both the infiltration of T-cells and the penetration of chemotherapeutic agents, and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. CCK receptors, normally expressed in the GI tract and the nervous system, are overexpressed on fibroblasts and certain cancers.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

In mice having inhaled these gases, isopropanol and acetone were yielded from propane, sec-butanol and methyl ethyl ketone from n-butane, and tert-butanol from iso-butane as the respective metabolites. In addition, liver microsomes were found to contain the enzymic system participating in these metabolisms. In vitro reactions with liver microsomes produced isopropanol from propane, sec-butanol from n-butane, and tert-butanol from iso-butane. It was assumed that hydrocarbons were first converted to (omega-1)-alcohols by microsomal enzyme system and then to corresponding ketones by alcohol dehydrogenase.",

The newly developed analytical procedure is suitable for both emergency cases and forensic medicine investigations. Its practical applicability is illustrated with a forensic blood sample after acute inhalative intoxication with lighter fluid; case history and toxicological findings are included. Identification and quantitation of the analytes were performed using static headspace extraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In order to reconcile the large gas volumes injected (0.5 mL) with the narrowbore capillary column and thus achieve preconcentration, cold trapping on a Tenax sorbent followed by flash desorption was applied. Adequate retention and separation were achieved isothermally at 35 degrees C on a thick-film capillary column. Sample preparation was kept to a strict minimum and involved simply adding 2.5 uL of a liquid solution of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane in t-butyl-methylether as an internal standard to aliquots of blood in a capped vial. Standards were created by volumetric dilution departing from a gravimetrically prepared calibration gas mixture composed of 0.3% of n-propane, 0.7% of iso-butane, and 0.8% of n-butane in nitrogen. In the forensic blood sample, the following concentrations were measured: 90.0 ug/L for n-propane, 246 ug/L for iso-butane, and 846 ug/L for n-butane.",

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957), Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966), Methane (UN1971) and Hydrogen and Methane mixture, compressed (UN2034) are lighter than air and will rise. Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket. CAUTION: When LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972) is released on or near water, product may vaporize explosively. (ERG, 2024)",

The models relate the applied vacuum, soil permeability, and spill composition to the vapor flowrates, velocities, mass removal rates, and residual composition changes with time. In this report the screening models and some sample calculations are presented . The results illustrate the advantages and limitations of venting as a remediation tool, under both ideal and nonideal conditions."

Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. CAUTION: For LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972), DO NOT apply water, regular or alcohol-resistant foam directly on spill. Use a high-expansion foam if available to reduce vapors. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2024)",

Prior to working with this chemical, you should be trained on its proper handling and storage. Before entering confined space where isobutane may be present, check to make sure that an explosive concentration odes not exist. Isobutane cylinders should be stored in a cool, well-ventilated dry area of noncombustible construction. Protect containers against physical damage. Store away from sources of heat or ignition and from oxygen, chlorine, and other oxidizers. Sources of ignition, such as smoking and open flames, are prohibited where isobutane is handled, used, or stored. Ground and bond all lines and equipment used with isobutane. Wherever isobutane is used, handled, manufactured, or stored, use explosion-proof electrical equipment and fittings. Procedures for the handling, use, and storage of cylinders should be in compliance with OSHA 1910.101 and 1910.169, as with the recommendations of the Compressed Gas Association.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957), Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) and Methane (UN1971) are lighter than air and will rise.  Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket.",

It is used in organic synthesis, as a refrigerant, in motor fuels, and as aerosol propellant, as well as in synthetic rubber, and in instrument calibration fluid. HUMAN STUDIES: Isobutane is a simple asphyxiant. Acute exposure may cause tachypnea and tachycardia. In severe cases, hypotension, apnea, and cardiac arrest develop. Direct contact with the liquid produces chemical burns. Toxicologically, the vapor exerts no effect on skin and eyes. A case of ventricular fibrillation due to isobutane toxicity after unintentional inhalation of air freshener has been reported. The intentional inhalation of a volatile substance (\"sniffing\") causing euphoria and hallucinations is a form of substance abuse in children and adolescents with a high morbidity and mortality. Sudden death can be caused by cardiac arrhythmia, asphyxia or trauma. Fatal cases of isobutane sniffing of cigarette lighter refill containing isobutane has been reported. ANIMAL STUDIES: Studies in rabbits exposed through the eyes to undiluted hairspray containing 22% isobutane showed that irritation of the eye was immediately evident with transient iritis and mild conjunctivitis. Acute exposure in dogs to 55 mg/L isobutane was fatal, and 45 mg/L caused anesthesia. Two-hour exposures of mice to 41 mg/L isobutane caused death in 60% of the exposed animals, whereas exposure to 52 mg/L was lethal to 100% of the animals within an average of 28 min. Isobutane is a CNS depressant in the mouse at 15% in 60 min, and at 23% in 26 min. Isobutane caused apnea and finally cardiac arrest in anesthetized rats. Isobutane tested negative in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay.",

First, the response to exposure periods of 1 min, 2 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, and 8 hr were studied. There being no untoward responses to these acute exposures, the eight volunteers were exposed repetitively to isobutane at concentrations of 500 ppm, 1, 2 or 8 hr per day, five days per week for two weeks. Then exposures to two mixtures of isobutane and propane for 1, 2 or 8 hr per day for two days were studied. During the investigation all subjects were kept under comprehensive medical surveillance. No untoward subjective responses or abnormal physiological responses occurred during or following these exposures. Special emphasis was placed on evaluating the cardiac and pulmonary response to these exposures through the use of continuous ECG telemetry and serial computerized spirometric measurements. The following serial laboratory studies were unaltered by the exposures: complete blood count, urinalysis, serum alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, LDH, serum bilirubin, blood sugar, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, BUN, spontaneous electroencephalogram, visual evoked response, a battery of cognitive tests, and an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test.",

Specimens of blood, urine, stomach contents, brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and fat were collected and analyzed for propylene, propane, isobutane, and n-butane by headspace gas chromatography. n-Butane was the major substance among the volatiles found in the tissues of cases 1 and 2, and propane was the major substance in case 3. A combination of the autopsy findings and the gas analysis results revealed that the cause of death was ventricular fibrillation induced by hard muscle exercise after gas inhalation in cases 1 and 2, and that the cause of death in case 3 might be hypoxia. It is possible that the victim in case 3 was under anesthetic toxicity of accumulated isobutane which is a minor component of liquefied petroleum gas.",

Isobutane is a component of natural gas. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2610 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isobutane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase isobutane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 hours. Isobutane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isobutane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 250. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.19 atm-cu m/mole. Isobutane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor. Isobutane reached 49% mineralization after 20 days using an activated sludge inoculum suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process under certain conditions in soil. If released into water, isobutane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Microcosm experiments designed to simulate natural estuaries reported half-lives for isobutane ranging from 16-26 days suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process under certain conditions in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 47 minutes and 3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 30 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to isobutane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isobutane is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate the general population may be exposed to isobutane via inhalation of ambient air, particularly in areas with heavy vehicular traffic or dermal exposure to products such as gasoline and fuels, insect spray, window and glass cleaner, personal spray deodorant, and rug and upholstery cleaners containing isobutane.

The respective half-lives are 11 days and 23 days(SRC). The results indicate that gas exchange is the dominant removal mechanism for isobutane gases from the water column following a hypothetical input. Scaling up the predicted gas exchange rate constants (0.26/day and 0.017/day at 20 and 10 \u00b0C, respectively) so they are consistent with natural estuaries, the volatilization half-lives for isobutane from the water columns in natural estuaries(1) are estimated to be 4.4 and 6.8 days at 20 and 10 \u00b0C, respectively(SRC). Isobutane also biodegrades in the microcosm at a rate that is slower than for n-butane and falls between propane and ethane in susceptibility. Biodegradation of isobutane initially occurs with a half-lives of 16-26 days at 20 \u00b0C and 33-139 days at 10 \u00b0C, significantly slower than the loss predicted by gas exchange from typical natural estuaries. However, after a lag of 2-4 weeks, the biodegradation rate increases markedly so that in the case of chronic inputs, biodegradation can become the dominant removal mechanism(1).",

The removal rate constant of isobutane is 0.061/day (standard deviation 0.005/day) at 20 \u00b0C and 0.030/day (standard deviation 0.006/day) at 10 \u00b0C(1). The respective half-lives are 11 days and 23 days(SRC). The results indicate that gas exchange is the dominant removal mechanism for isobutane gases from the water column following a hypothetical input. Scaling up the predicted gas exchange rate constants (0.26/day and 0.017/day at 20 and 10 \u00b0C, respectively) so they are consistent with natural estuaries, the volatilization half-lives for isobutane from the water columns in natural estuaries(1) are estimated to be 4.4 and 6.8 days at 20 and 10 \u00b0C, respectively(SRC). Isobutane also biodegrades in the  microcosm at a rate that is slower than for n-butane and falls between propane and ethane in susceptibility. Biodegradation of isobutane is significantly slower than the loss predicted by gas exchange from typical natural estuaries. However, after a lag of 2-4 weeks, the biodegradation rate increases markedly so that in the case of chronic inputs, biodegradation can become the dominant removal mechanism(1).",

The hydroxyl radical reaction product, 2-methylpropionaldehyde, may further react in the atmosphere to form peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs), phytotoxic components of photochemical smog(2,3). Gas-phase isobutane is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with nitrate radicals(SRC); half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 165 days(4). Isobutane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(5). Isobutane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The average isobutane concentration was lower in the southern hemisphere; the concentration between 35 deg N - 8 deg N, 8 deg N - 3 deg S, and 3 deg S and 30 deg S was 4.9, 2.9 and 1.2 picomoles/L, respectively. The concentration of dissolved gas-phase isobutane in surface water in the Indian Ocean (n = 8) ranged from 0.12 to 1.78 nanoliters (gas) per liter of water(2). While the concentration varied, the relative abundance of isobutane with respect to nonmethane hydrocarbons was practically constant(2).",

Emissions of 25 vehicles (mostly 1986 model year) were tested under different driving conditions(1). The average emission were (type of driving (avg speed), emissions in mg/km): cold start (18.51 km/hr), 75.01; warm start (18.53 km/hr), 95.68; urban (21.38 km/hr), 65.66; suburban (41.73 km/hr), 29.64; rural (54.53 km/hr), 17.44; motorway (90.72 km/hr), 8.81; motorway (111.36 km/hr), 8.57(1,2). For suburban driving, 4 low-emission vehicles had isobutane emissions ranging from 0.8-18 mg/km at 40 km/hr(2). The emission of isobutane from a car dropped from 53 mg/km at 20 km/hr to 9 mg/hr between 90 and 110 km/hr(1). In emission tests using single component fuels, isobutane occurred in engine emissions when n-heptane, 1-hexene, and cyclohexane was burned, but not with toluene, isooctane or methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)(4).",

A study of VOC emission in California South Coast Air Basin found that the sources of isobutane were (source, percent): gasoline exhaust, 6%; whole (liquid) gasoline, 3%; gasoline vapors, 36%; waste and natural gas, 21%; other, 34%(5). No isobutane emissions were attributed to coatings and adhesives(5). Isobutane gasoline exhaust emissions in the U.K have been estimated to be 5.29 and 14.5 kilotonnes by two investigators, constituting respectively 2% and 4% of exhaust emissions(1,3). Isobutane is found in underwater hydrocarbon vent plumes from offshore production; the concn in one plume was 560 umol/L(7). Isobutane constituted 0.004% of municipal sanitary landfill gas at Palos Verdes, CA(2). The landfill was in the anaerobic phase. Isobutane was found in emissions from the combustion of waste PVC plastics under conditions of incomplete combustion but not under conditions of complete combustion(4). Isobutane is used in consumer products such as insect spray, window and glass cleaner, personal care and pet products, arts and craft products,  auto and home maintenance products and rug and upholstery cleaners(8,9) and may be released when these products are manufactured or used(SRC).",

Ambient air concentrations for isobutane in the National Ambient Volatile Organic Compounds data base (n = 887): mean 5.706 ppb, median 3.290 ppb, 25th percentile 1.728 ppb, 75th percentile 6.213 ppb(1).

The concentration of isobutane in Japan along the direction of air mass movement was 4.4 ppb in Yokahama, 1.3 ppb in Takasaki, and 1.5 ppb in Kuruzawa(5). The decrease in concentration was attributed to photooxidation.",

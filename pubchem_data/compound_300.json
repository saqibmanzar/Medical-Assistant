Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

We examined the effectiveness of monochloroacetic acid (MCA) for patients with common or plantar warts. Consecutive patients aged 4 years and older with one or more newly diagnosed common or plantar warts were recruited in 53 Dutch general practices. We randomly allocated eligible patients to 13-week treatment protocols of office-applied MCA versus liquid nitrogen cryotherapy every 2 weeks for patients with common warts (n=188), and MCA versus cryotherapy combined with daily SA self-application for patients with plantar warts (n=227). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose warts were all cured at 13 weeks. In the common wart group, cure rates were 40/92 (43%, 95% confidence interval 34-54) for MCA and 50/93 (54%, 44-64) for cryotherapy (risk difference (RD) -10%, -25-4.0, P=0.16). In the plantar wart group, cure rates were 49/106 (46%, 37-56) for MCA and 45/115 (39%, 31-48) for cryotherapy combined with SA (RD 7.1, 5.9-20, P=0.29). For common warts, MCA is an effective alternative to cryotherapy to avoid pain during the treatment, although pain after the treatment is similar. For plantar warts, office-applied MCA may be preferred over cryotherapy combined with SA, on the basis of comparable effectiveness, less treatment pain, and less treatment burden.",

Concentrations of MCA in plasma, liver, heart, lungs, and brown fat paralleled each other, whereas those in brain and thymus did not. There was no dose proportionality in tissue concentrations. Elimination of MCA from plasma required modeling by two compartments. Most of the radioactivity found in plasma was parent MCA. Elimination rate constant (K(10)) and distribution rate constant (K(12)) were greatly reduced at the toxic dose. Elimination of the toxic dose was further retarded due to increased retention of MCA in the peripheral compartment as indicated by increased mean residence times in most tissues. A very large fraction of dose was found in the gastrointestinal tract, almost all of which was reabsorbed. Attempts to reduce toxicity by blocking the enterohepatic circulation with activated charcoal or cholestyramine failed. Radioactivity found in bile was associated with one metabolite more polar than the parent compound. A very large fraction of dose (73 and 59%) was found in urine, 55 to 68% of which was parent MCA. The rate-determining step in the toxicity of MCA was identified as its detoxification by the liver...",

At the subtoxic oral dose, concentration of (14)C-MCA peaked at 0.1% of dose by 2 hr. Most tissue profiles of MCA paralleled that of plasma with few exceptions. At the toxic oral dose, tissue concentrations remained initially below those seen after the subtoxic dose, because stomach retained most of the toxic dose for up to 8 hr. Peak plasma concentration was reached within 0.25 hr without an apparent subsequent uptake phase. Most of the dermal dose rapidly penetrated into the skin (>95% within 0.25 hr) and remained sequestered there and released slowly. Concentration in plasma peaked at 0.36% of dose by 0.75 hr and remained constant for up to 4 hr. Peak tissue concentrations were reached between 2 and 4 hr. Within 0.75 hr, 9% of the dermally absorbed dose was metabolized by liver and eliminated through bile, all of which was subsequently reabsorbed. Two percent of MCA appeared in colon by 0.75 hr, apparently as a result of direct transport through GI-wall in retrograde movement. About 70-80% of radioactivity recovered from the small intestine of orally dosed rats was parent compound. Fecal elimination was negligible (</=1%). Urinary excretion was 64-72% of the dose. At the toxic oral dose, urinary excretion was initially slow and accelerated after 8 hr. The plasma half-life was 2 hr for oral and 4 hr for dermal administration. Differential oral low and high dose kinetics was due to delayed stomach emptying and not to saturation of metabolic pathways. Dose-responses were steep, with no overt toxicity (coma/death) up to 200 (oral) and 100 (dermal) mg/kg, whereas 100% mortality occurred at 450 (LD50 > 400 and < 450) and 175 (LD50 145) mg/kg after oral and dermal exposure, respectively.",

The animals were sacrificed at 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hr following the treatment. The distribution of (14)C-label, determined in different tissues, suggests that CA is rapidly absorbed and eliminated from the body. The elimination phase appears to be fast for intestine and kidney as compared to other tissues. Maximum radioactivity was detected in intestine and kidney at 4 and 8 hr following the treatment which was followed by liver, spleen, testes, lung, brain and heart in a decreasing order. A group of rats treated with a single oral dose of 1 mmole/kg (1-(14)C)CA, by gavage, was also sacrificed at 24 hr following the exposure to study the effect of a higher dose on distribution of (1-(14)C)CA. The distribution of (14)C-label at both dose levels indicates that toxicokinetic properties of CA are dose-dependent. Another group of rats administered 1 mmole/kg (1-(14)C) CA daily for three days was also sacrificed at 24 hr following the last dose to evaluate the bioaccumulating properties of CA and/or its metabolites in the tissues. As compared to the number of doses given, the accumulation of (14)C-label was not as large as expected. (14)C-Label determined in the dialyzed plasma, suggests an in vivo binding of (14)C-label to plasma proteins where albumin accounted for about 65% as determined by affinity chromatography...",

To understand the mechanism of monochloroacetic acid (MCA) toxicity, ... the tissue distribution of (1-(14)C)MCA in rats /was studied/ by a whole-body autoradiographic technique. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a tracer dose of (1-14C)MCA (6.8 ug/100 g (40 uCi) body weight) by tail vein and euthanized at different time intervals (5 min, 1, 4, 12, 24 and 48 hr). ... At 5 min, there was a rapid accumulation of (14)C-activity in the kidney cortex and stomach walls. The radioactivity was rapidly removed from the circulation. There was high accumulation of (14)C-activity in the myocardial tissues. The liver was also loaded with MCA and/or its metabolites. After 1 hr following administration of (14)MCA, radioactivity was extensively excreted into the small intestinal lumen. The accumulation of (14)C-activity in the brain, thymus, salivary glands and tongue was prominent at 1 hr. After 4 hr the liver and other tissues started to eliminate most of the radioactivity. Contrary to other tissues, however, the central nervous system, thymus and pancreas started to accumulate the radioactivity at later time periods. These observations suggest the accumulation of MCA and/or its metabolites into hydrophilic tissues at earlier time periods and into lipophilic tissues at later times.",

Metabolites of MCA identified in the urine included S-carboxymethylcysteine (33%-43% free and 1%-6% conjugated), thiodiacetic acid (thiodiglycolic acid was found to be the major urinary metabolite of S-carboxymethylcysteine, and most of the glycolate was oxidized to carbon dioxide. The metabolism proceeds probably by enzymatic hydrolysis of the carbon-chlorine bond with the formation of glycolic acid . MCA also conjugates with GSH to form the S-carboxymethyl derivative of GSH, which is then converted to S-carboxymethyl cysteine. In Wistar rats given 50 mg/kg MCA by gavage, thiodiglycolic acid was identified as the major urinary metabolite, accounting for 60% of the administered dose. A greater percentage of administered MCA was excreted as thiodiglycolic acid in rats than in mice; in both species most of the remainder of the dose was excreted as S-carboxymethylcysteine. ... Preliminary pharmacokinetic studies with MCA in rats /showed/ that MCA was rapidly metabolized, and detoxication by conjugation with glutathione appeared to be a major metabolic pathway.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Chlorination of acetic acid: In this process acetic acid is chlorinated in the liquid phase at temperatures between 85 and 120 \u00b0C. Acetic anhydride and/or acetylchloride may be used as catalysts. The chlorination product contains considerable amounts of acetic acid and/or dichloroacetic acid. Purification takes place either by selective dechlorination of dichloroacetic acid (by treatment with hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium) and subsequent distillation or by recrystallisation from suitable solvents. 2. Hydrolysis of trichloroethylene: In this process equal weights of trichloroethylene and sulphuric acid are heated to 130-140 \u00b0C in the reactor. A mixture of trichloroethylene and sulphuric acid is continuously fed to the bottom of the reactor. The chloroacetic acid and sulphuric acid are permitted to overflow into a cascade, where the chloroacetic acid is distilled at 20 mm Hg and the sulphuric acid is recycled. The hydrolysis of trichioroethylene yields high-purity monochloroacetic acid, but has the disadvantage of utilising a relatively more expensive starting material.",

In contrast to other plants, this plant includes a chimney. MCA-flakes and solutions, and SMCA (sodium monochloroacetate) are packed by automated procedures and stored in a cool, dry ventilated place separate from other chemicals. Storage and handling systems utilize glass-lined steel storage tanks, glass-lined or PTFE plastic-lined pipes, valves and pumps. Storage tanks prevented from freezing are connected to a vent scrubbing system. Empty MCA/SMCA containers can contain residues, gases and mists or dusts. MCA and SMCA should not be disposed of in a landfill or water course. MCA solid is transported by /truck/ in fiberdrums with an innerbag of polyethane with a capacity for either 92 or 800 kg. MCA solution is transported in stainless steel tankers. SMCA is transported by /truck/ in paper bags with capacity of 50 - 100 kg.",

The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

The potential for circulatory collapse is high following ingestion of chloroacetic acid. Acute inhalation exposure may result in sneezing, hoarseness, choking, laryngitis, dyspnea (shortness of breath), respiratory tract irritation, and chest pain. Bleeding of nose and gums, ulceration of the nasal and oral mucosa, pulmonary edema, chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia may also occur. If the eyes have come in contact with chloroacetic acid, then irritation, pain, swelling, corneal erosion, and blindness may result. Dermal exposure may result in dermatitis (red, inflamed skin), severe burns, and pain.",

Where possible, automatically pump liquid from drums or other storage containers to process containers. Drums must be equipped with self-closing valves, pressure vacuum bungs, and flame arresters. Use only non-sparking tools and equipment, especially when opening and closing containers of this chemical. Sources of ignition such as smoking and open flames are prohibited where this chemical is used, handled, or stored in a manner that could create a potential fire or explosion hazard.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

These organic compounds donate hydrogen ions if a base is present to accept them. They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Soluble carboxylic acid dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymerization reactions; like other acids, they often catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions.",

They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Soluble carboxylic acid dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymerization reactions; like other acids, they often catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions.",

Most of the chloroacetic acid produced is used to manufacture several hundred thousand tons annually of carboxymethyl cellulose. Another major application is the production of herbicides based on arylhydroxyacetic acids. HUMAN STUDIES: The anticipated acute and chronic human health hazards posed by MCA are effects on the cardiac system, the central nervous system, and kidneys. In addition, MCA is highly corrosive and irritating to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. Acute dermal exposure of workers to MCA may result in death even after rapid and extensive washing of the skin area. The effects may be delayed. The biochemical mechanism of action resulting in death is not understood. Contributing factors apparently believed to be involved are: (i) the inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle decreasing cellular energy supply and increasing acidosis with glycolic acid and oxalate production, and; (ii) effects on cellular components where sulfhydryl groups are critical for normal biological activity. Both of these effects may contribute to CNS, cardiovascular, renal and hepatic effects. In addition, the metabolites glycolic acid and oxalate may contribute to CNS and renal toxicity. A case of joint deformity reported after the use of a preparation containing MCA for topical wart treatment. MCA did not induce DNA strand breaks in human CCRF-CEM cells. ANIMAL STUDIES: Fatalities among rabbits are expected when only 3% of the skin is exposed. Thorough washing after 1 minute contact did not decrease mortalities. In rats after subcutaneous administration of MCA (108, 135 or 163 mg/kg) hypoglycemia and lung injury appear to cause death in response to MCA exposure. MCA caused front paw rigidity in 10% of mice surviving a single oral toxic dose (320-380 mg/kg). Male mice orally administered 300 mg/kg bw MCA showed tremors, respiratory depression, and occasionally tonic and clonic convulsions. Some survivors had a Straub tail, severe tremors, and front limb paralysis after 24 hours (after exposure). Pregnant rats were dosed MCA by oral intubation on gestation days 6 to 15 with 0, 17, 35, 70, or 140 mg/kg bw/day. The percentage of soft tissue malformations was increased, however not dose-related. No skeletal malformations were found. In the highest dose-group a statistically significant increase of malformations of the cardiovascular system, comprising predominantly levocardia, was found. MCA was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98, TA100, TA102, TA104, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538) and Escherichia coli strains (WP2uvrA and WP2uvrA/pKM101) with or without metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: A large number of passerine birds, mainly greenfinches, were found dead or dying in a hedgerow close to a field of onions recently sprayed with sodium salt of MCA. Chemical analysis confirmed the exposure of the birds to the chemical. MCA had high regeneration toxicity with teratogenicity in Hydra digestive region.",

Rats were injected with 80 mg/kg sodium monochloroacetate (SMCA) (single lethal dose) and then infused with saline (control group) or 5% or 10% glucose solution at 2 mL/hour for ten hours. No animal in the control group survived the total 14-day follow-up period. The survival rate in 5% glucose group was 57% at ten hours; it decreased to 14% at 14 days. The survival rate in 10% glucose group was 79% at ten hours, and all rats that survived the first ten hours also survived the 14 days. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed the survival rate in 10% glucose group to be improved upon in both the 5% glucose group and the control group. Blood glucose and lactate levels were measured every hour during infusion. Blood glucose levels decreased in the control group but remained in the glucose-infused groups. Although the blood lactate level increased in each group, there was an excellent inverse linear relation between blood glucose levels and blood lactate levels. Thus, continuous parenteral infusion of glucose solution at an early stage after exposure may be an effective clinical therapy for the prevention of hypoglycemia and metabolic lactic acidosis caused by MCA.",

The solution contained 1.5 M MCAA in ethanol 94%. The arm was rinsed with water for 10 minutes; despite this, erythema and small blisters appeared in the first hour. The lesions healed in 10 days with small scars. After 14 days, itchy vesicles appeared at the site of the scars. On day 28 the patient was patch tested with the international standard series and the MCAA solution 1% in methanol 70%. A strong 4+ reaction was observed to the MCAA solution. Two control persons were negative. According to the authors the ethylester of MCAA (EMCA) was suspected as the causative agent (MCAA + ethanol may react to EMCA and water). On day 49, patch testing was performed with 1% EMCA (purity 99.9%) in acetone and ethanol and 1% MCAA in aq. Strong 4+ reactions were observed to the patches with EMCA, MCAA was negative.",

The mean mortality delay was higher in rabbits infused with ethanol after MCAA exposure than in rabbits not infused with ethanol.

At times, gastric hemorrhage may be intense, and the vomitus then contains fresh blood. Profound thirst. 3) Ulceration of all membranes and tissues with which the acid comes in contact ... . 4) Circulatory collapse with clammy skin, weak and rapid pulse, shallow respirations, and scanty urine. Circulatory shock is often the immediate cause of death. 5) Asphyxial death due to glottic edema. 6) Late esophageal, gastric and pyloric strictures and stenoses, which may require major surgical repair, should be anticipated. Signs of obstruction commonly appear within a few weeks but may be delayed for months and even years. Permanent scars may also appear in the cornea, skin and oropharynx. 7) Uncorrected circulatory collapse of several hours' duration may lead to renal failure and ischemic lesions in the liver and heart."

Dose-response effects, hypoglycemia, and lung injury in rats exposed to monochloroacetic acid (MCA) /were evaluated/. Serum glucose, blood gases, and parameters of alveolar injury in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analysed 2 and 4 hr after subcutaneous administration of MCA (108, 135 or 163 mg/kg). Apparent pulmonary injury and hypoglycemia were not identified 2 hr after administration, but lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total cells in BALF were dose-dependently increased; and severe hypoglycemia was identified 4 hr after administration. Blood gas analysis showed remarkable alveolar gas dysfunction as exchange in the 163 mg/kg group. Thus, hypoglycemia and lung injury appear to cause death in response to MCA exposure.",

Therefore, harmful local and systemic effects were investigated after dermal exposure to MCA. A 0.5 mL aliquot of MCA solution (40% w/w) was applied to the abdominal skin of ten 10-week-old male SD rats under anesthesia. The exposure area (25 x 25 sq mm) was 1.6% of the total surface area. The dose of MCA per area was 34.1 mg/sq cm. Saline was similarly administered to 10 control rats. Histopathological findings after 10 min were observed by light microscopy. Blood samples were collected by exsanguinations from the carotid arteries after 4 hr. Skin samples were collected 10 min after the initial exposure. Histological findings showed severe degeneration of collagen bundles in the epidermis and subcutaneous tissues. P(CO2), HCO(3)-, TCO2, base excess (BE) and glucose levels were decreased in the MCA group. AST, m-AST, ALT, BUN, Cr, NH3, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, RBC, Hb, Hct, total protein and albumin were increased in the MCA group. The burn was determined to be a third-degree burn on the basis of the histopathological findings. The severe toxicity was probably a consequence of the rapid permeability. Biochemical parameters were a consequence of hepatocellular injuries, renal dysfunction, dysglyconeogenesis and dysfunction of ammonia metabolism. MCA reportedly enters the TCA cycle and inhibits aconitase. MCA metabolites also inhibit pyruvate carboxylase in the gluconeogenesis pathway. Therefore, the important serum biochemical abnormalities such as hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis should be monitored to find the acute systemic disorders.",

In rats, dose-related increases in blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were observed, and relative liver and kidney weights were elevated. There were no compound-related changes in the various hematologic or clinical pathology parameters in mice.

Body Weight and Survival in the 2-Year Studies Mean body weights of low- and high-dose female and low-dose male rats receiving monochloroacetic acid were within 10% of those of controls throughout the studies; however, after week 30, the mean body weights of high-dose male rats were 4% to 8% less than those of controls. In mice, the mean body weights of dosed males were similar to controls, but those of low- and high-dose females were 6% to 10% less than control values after week 52. Survival of high-dose male and dosed female rats and high-dose male mice was significantly lower than that of controls (male rats: control, 27/53; low-dose, 21/53; high-dose, 16/53; female rats: 37/53; 19/53; 26/53; male mice: 46/60; 39/60; 21/60; female mice: 42/60; 40/60; 44/60).  Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions in the 2-Year Studies: There was no compound-related increase in the incidence of neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions in rats given monochloroacetic acid for 2 years. The incidence of uterine stromal polyps in low- and high-dose female rats was slightly higher than that in controls (2/60; 7/57; 10/60). However, the incidence in the controls was unusually low, and those in the dosed groups were well within the range for NTP historical controls (mean: 21%, range: 10%-38%). Further, because the only malignant stromal neoplasm occurred in a control animal, the polyps were not considered to be related to the administration of monochloroacetic acid. Similarly, there was no monochloroacetic acid-related increase in the incidence of neoplasms in male or female mice, and malignant lymphoma occurred with a significant negative trend in dosed female mice. Increases in the incidence of inflammation of the mucosa of the nasal passages, respiratory epithelial metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium of the nose, and focal squamous cell hyperplasia of the forestomach occurred in dosed male and female mice.",

In a previous study, the authors' group has detected the presence of many brominated DBPs and identified five new aromatic brominated DBPs in chlorinated saline sewage effluents. The presence of brominated DBPs in chlorinated saline effluents may pose adverse implications for marine ecology. In this study, besides the detection and identification of another seven new aromatic halogenated DBPs in a chlorinated saline sewage effluent, their developmental toxicity was evaluated using the marine polychaete Platynereis dumerilii. For comparison, the developmental toxicity of some commonly known halogenated DBPs was also examined. The rank order of the developmental toxicity of 20 halogenated DBPs was 2,5-dibromohydroquinone > 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol >/= 2,4,6-triiodophenol > 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol >/= 4-bromophenol > 2,4-dibromophenol >/= 2,6-dibromo-4-nitrophenol > 2-bromo-4-chlorophenol > 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol > 2,4-dichlorophenol > 2,4,6-tribromophenol > 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde > bromoform >/= 2,4,6-trichlorophenol > 2,6-dibromophenol > 2,6-dichlorophenol > iodoacetic acid >/= tribromoacetic acid > bromoacetic acid > chloroacetic acid. On the basis of developmental toxicity data, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) was established. The QSAR involved two physical-chemical property descriptors (log P and pKa) and two electronic descriptors (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy and the highest occupied molecular orbital energy) to indicate the transport, biouptake, and biointeraction of these DBPs. It can well predict the developmental toxicity of most of the DBPs tested.",

Replicate 12,000 L enclosures were treated with 0, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/L of MCA. Each microcosm was stocked with eight individual apical shoots of M. spicatum and M. sibiricum 1 day prior to initiation of exposure. Plants were sampled after 4, 7, 14 and 28 days of exposure and their response assessed using numerous somatic and biochemical endpoints. L. gibba was introduced into the microcosms the day of MCA treatment and monitored regularly for 21 days. The half-life of MCA in the water column ranged between 86 and 523 hr. The most sensitive plant species was M. spicatum, followed by M. sibiricum and L. gibba. All species demonstrated toxicity within a threefold range of each other. Endpoint sensitivity varied depending on the duration of exposure and the level of effect chosen. Most species endpoint EC(x) values were less than an order of magnitude different. Citrate levels in Myriophyllum spp. were not influenced by exposure to MCA. The toxicity of MCA to M. spicatum and M. sibiricum was very similar and thus highly predictive of toxicity observed for each other. The EC(10) was a more conservative estimate of toxicity than the statistically derived no observed effect concentration. Current concentrations of MCA are not likely to pose a risk to these aquatic plants in surface waters.",

It's former use as a herbicide in the US resulted in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.5X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chloroacetic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase chloroacetic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 days. Chloroacetic acid absorbs UV light at wavelengths 218 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm. If released to soil, chloroacetic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2. The pKa of chloroacetic acid is 2.87, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Chloroacetic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 65% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 3 weeks with acclimation indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil under specific conditions. If released into water, chloroacetic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. No biodegradation was reported for chloroacetic acid following 3 days incubation in both river water and seawater, indicating that biodegradation may not be an important environmental fate process in water. A pKa of 2.87 indicates chloroacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests that the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to chloroacetic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to chloroacetic acid via ingestion of chlorinated or chloraminated drinking water or swimming pool/spa water, ingestion of foods made or washed with chlorinated water and dermal contact with chlorinated water.

The pKa of chloroacetic acid is 2.87(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Chloroacetic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 6.5X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(6). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 65% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 3 weeks with acclimation(7) indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil under specific conditions(SRC).",

A pKa of 2.87(4) indicates chloroacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). No biodegradation was reported for chloroacetic acid following 3 days incubation in both river water and seawater(6), indicating that biodegradation may not be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase chloroacetic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.9X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The test was repeated under the assumption that the test substance inhibited the sludge because only 1 replicate of 2 showed biodegradation tendency(1). After 4 weeks, 2 out of 5 replicates had degraded more than 90%, while the remaining 3 replicates had degraded more than 60%(1). CO2 evolution was 14-24% and 73% of the theoretical amount possible at a chloroacetic acid concentration of 4.5 and 9.0 mg carbon/L, respectively, after a 7-day incubation with an activated sludge inoculum(2). Chloroacetic acid was completely degraded in the Closed Bottle test (at 5 mg/L), the Modified OECD Screening Test (at 5 mg C/L), and the Zahn-Wellens Test (at 1000 mg/L)(3). Chloroacetic acid was degraded in laboratory biodegradation tests using sewage or acclimated sludge inocula with greater than 70-90% degradation being reported in 5-10 days(4-7,9). Degradation was increased by acclimation(7,9) and involves dechlorination(7). Mineralization occurred in river water with 73% of the chemical being converted to carbon dioxide in 8-10 days at 29 \u00b0C(8). The biodegradability of chloroacetic acid, at 10 ppm, was measured in both river water and seawater using the cultivation method; no biodegradation was reported for either samples after a 3-day incubation(10). Based on these results, this compound was determined to be difficult to degrade(10).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 20 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Chloroacetic acid is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Chloroacetic acid absorbs UV light at wavelengths 218 nm(3) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm(SRC). Chloroacetic acid was very slowly photodechlorinated in air-saturated solutions with <0.4% being converted to free chloride when irradiated for 11 hours in a laboratory photoreactor. Direct photodechlorination is much lower in the absence of oxygen. The presence of sensitizers such as p-cresol and tryptophan that generate superoxide radicals increases the rate of photodechlorination by up to 16-fold(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Water collected from fifty-three Canadian drinking water treatment facilities in winter of 1993 contained chloroacetic acid(1). When bromide concentrations were very low (<0.01 mg/L), the water contained 2.1 ug/L chloroacetic acid; when bromide was low (0.06 mg/L), the water contained 1.2 ug/L chloroacetic acid; when bromide was moderate (0.5 mg/L), the water contained 0.6 ug/L chloroacetic acid(1).  Swiss drinking water monitored between 1996 and 1997 contained 20-211 ng/L chloroacetic acid(2). Chloroacetic acid was detected at 29 of 35 Finnish waterworks between January and October 1994 with concentrations between 0.7 and 4.7 ug/L; levels at all other facilities were below quantitation limits(3).",

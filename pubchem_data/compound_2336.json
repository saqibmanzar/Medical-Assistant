When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The period of application did not exceed 4 mo, and diam of treated area was 2 cm. A progressive series of alterations developed in normal skin (chronically): erythema, pigmentation, desquamation, formation of verrucae, /clinically not true verrucae/ and infiltration. The manifestations regressed completely within 2 to 3 mo of cessation of treatment. Clinically, perceptible erythema occurred in only 2 patients with basal cell cancer. Pigmentation, which occurred in all patients, consisted of an increase in melanin in basal cell layer of epidermis and was more evident in exposed skin (eg, hand, face). It developed more readily in skin of senile individuals than in younger patients. Rarely, small masses of pigment granules were found in the more superficial layers. Desquamation was proportional in extent to erythema of the 1st stage. The formation of verrucae was the most constant manifestation caused by treatment.

Myelotoxic and teratogenic effects were also noted in rodents. The Committee concluded that carcinogenicity was the critical effect for conduct of human health risk assessment of oral exposure to B(a)P and noted that the estimated range of daily dietary intakes of B(a)P in human populations were 4 orders of magnitude lower than dietary levels reported to be non-carcinogenic in a rat bioassay. This large difference between estimated human intake levels and doses that produce tumors in rats suggests that any human health effects of the current levels of B(a)P are likely to be small. Despite this, the considerable uncertainties in risk estimation require that efforts should be made to minimize human exposure to benzo [a]pyrene as far as is practicable.",

Values for excretion of BaP complexed with rat or human lipoproteins were comparable. Excretion increased as the degree of BaP hydroxylation increased. The excretion of BaP bound to very-low-density, low-density, or high-density lipoproteins in Aroclor-induced rats was not greater than the control.

Approx 73% of 30 colonic biopsy specimens from 7 ulcerative colitis patients could metabolize benzo[a]pyrene to oxidized products, with an average production of 11.6 nmol/mg biopsy protein. In contrast, 39% of 23 biopsy specimens from 5 normal persons showed an average metabolic activity, 2.79 nmol. Benzo[a]pyrene oxidation activity in colonic tissue from colitis patients was, on the average, fourfold greater than that in normal subjects. This study suggest that the colonic mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis has a greater ability than that of normal subjects to oxidize such chemicals possibly to electrophiles with higher mutagenic potential.",

To provide direct evidence for NFAT3 in the environmental carcinogen-caused carcinogenic effect, (+/-)-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (B[a]PDE), an ultimate environmental carcinogen metabolized from benzo[a]pyrene, was utilized. /Investigators/ found that exposure of Cl41 cells to B[a]PDE was able to induce cell transformation in Cl41 cells, while specific knock-down of NFAT3 resulted in the dramatic inhibition of this cell transformation. The tumorigenicity of B[a]PDE-caused transformed cells was confirmed in nude mice, whereas the tumor formation of B[a]PDE-treated NFAT3 small interference RNA (siRNA) knock-down cells was significantly reduced. Further studies showed that the role of NFAT3 in B[a]PDE-caused cell transformation was mediated by up-regulation of its downstream targeted gene TNF. This conclusion was based on the findings that inhibition of NFAT3 activation by either FK506 or NFAT3 siRNA dramatically down-regulated the TNF induction upon B[a]PDE exposure, and that knock-down of TNF by its specific siRNA also led to abrogation of B[a]PDE-induced cell transformation in Cl41 cells and their tumorigenicity in nude mice. Collectively, these results provide direct evidence for the important role of NFAT3 activation in B[a]PDE-induced cell transformation by up-regulation of TNF expression in mouse epidermal Cl41 cells, further suggesting that B[a]PDE may exert its tumor promotion effect on skin carcinogenesis, at least partially, by inducing TNF expression.",

The BPDE-mediated accumulation of sub-diploid fraction (apoptotic cells) was significantly decreased in H1299 cells transiently transfected with both Chk1 and Chk2 specific siRNAs. The H460 human lung cancer cell line (wild-type p53) was relatively more sensitive to BPDE-mediated growth inhibition and enrichment of sub-diploid apoptotic fraction compared with H1299 cells. The BPDE exposure failed to activate either S or G(2) phase checkpoint in H460 cells. Instead, the BPDE-treated H460 cells exhibited a nearly 8-fold increase in sub-diploid apoptotic cells that was accompanied by phosphorylation of p53 at multiple sites. Knockdown of p53 protein level in H460 cells attenuated BPDE-induced apoptosis but enforced activation of S and G(2) phase checkpoints. In conclusion, the present study points towards an important role of p53 in regulation of cellular responses to BPDE in human lung cancer cells. /Anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE)/",

The ultimate carcinogenic BaP metabolite produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), such as CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, anti-BaP-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide, binds covalently to DNA and causes mutations. The levels of various CYP isoforms can be significantly modulated under inflammatory conditions. As the chronic inflammation is known to contribute to carcinogenesis, we investigated interactions of a major proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and BaP in regulation of the expression of CYP1A1/1B1 and induction of DNA damage in rat liver epithelial WB-F344 cells. TNF-alpha enhanced induction of CYP1B1, while it simultaneously suppressed the BaP-induced CYP1A1 expression. The observed deregulation of CYP1 induction was found to be associated with a significantly enhanced formation of DNA adducts. The elevated DNA damage corresponded with increased phosphorylation of p53 tumor suppressor at Ser-15 residue, enhanced accumulation of cells in the S-phase of cell cycle and potentiation of BaP-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of CYP1B1 by fluoranthene significantly decreased both the formation of DNA adducts and the induction of apoptosis in WB-F344 cells treated with BaP and TNF-alpha, thus suggesting that this isoform might be responsible for genotoxic effects of BaP in nonparenchymal liver cells. Our results seem to indicate that inflammatory conditions might enhance genotoxic effects of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through upregulation of CYP1B1 expression.",

The concentration of urinary metabolites as a measure for individual PAH exposure takes account not only of PAH masses resorbed by the respiratory tract but also those incorporated percutaneously. The method allows the determination of 25 different components with a low margin of error; the individual metabolite profiles thereby allow conclusions on the individual characteristics of PAH-oxidizing enzymes (monooxygenases). The coefficients of variation are lower than 10%. After enzymatic treatment of the urine with glucuronidase and arylsulfatase one part of the benzene or toluene extract is treated with diazomethane to convert phenols into methylethers, while another part is used to convert dihydrodiols into phenols. After further purification the metabolites are determined by means of a combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The PAH exposure of coke plant workers during several consecutive days resulted in fairly constant individual urinary metabolite profiles which, however, exhibited significant inter-individual variability. This held true also for Wistar rats exposed to tar pitch aerosol on 5 days during a period of 10 days. It was also demonstrated that in the case of coke plant workers there is a correlation between inhaled PAH and metabolites excreted. Mass relationships between inhaled PAH and metabolites excreted were found to differ from one individual to another.",

Adducts to serum albumin (SA) are not repaired, unlike DNA adducts, and therefore considered advantageous in assessment of in vivo dose of BPDEs. In the present work, kinetic experiments were performed in relation to the dose (i.e. concentration over time) of different BPDE isomers, where human SA (hSA) was incubated with respective BPDEs under physiological conditions. A liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry methodology was employed for characterising respective BPDE-adducts at histidine and lysine. This strategy allowed to structurally distinguish between the adducts from racemic anti- and syn-BPDE and between (+)- and (-)-anti-BPDE, which has not been attained earlier. The adduct levels quantified by LC-UV and the estimated rate of disappearance of BPDEs in presence of hSA gave an insight into the reactivity of the diol epoxides towards the N-sites on SA. The structure specific method and dosimetry described in this work could be used for accurate estimation of in vivo dose of the BPDEs following exposure to B[a]P, primarily in dose response studies of genotoxicity, e.g. in mice, to aid in quantitative risk assessment of PAHs.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Benzo[a]pyrene (along with other PAHs) is released into the atmosphere as a component of smoke from forest fires, industrial processes, vehicle exhaust, cigarettes, and through the burning of fuel (such as wood, coal, and petroleum products). HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Epidemiology studies involving exposure to PAH mixtures have reported associations between internal biomarkers of exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-DNA adducts) and adverse birth outcomes (including reduced birth weight, postnatal body weight, and head circumference), neurobehavioral effects, and decreased fertility. In addition, there is strong evidence of carcinogenicity in occupations involving exposure to PAH mixtures containing benzo[a]pyrene, such as aluminum production, chimney sweeping, coal gasification, coal-tar distillation, coke production, iron and steel founding, and paving and roofing with coal tar pitch. An increasing number of occupational studies demonstrate a positive exposure-response relationship with cumulative BaP exposure and lung cancer. BaP was mutagenic in human MCL-5 cells. Accumulation of BaP in blood plasma of coking workers played a major role in the formation of lymphocyte micronucleus. The characteristics of chromosomal aberrations induced in vitro by activated benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) in lymphocyte cultures of 172 normal individuals ages 19-95 years were described. The BPDE-induced chromosomal aberrations were predominantly single chromatid breaks, with few isochromatid breaks or exchange figures. The genotoxic mechanism of action of benzo[a]pyrene involves metabolism to highly reactive species that form covalent adducts to DNA. These anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol- 9,10-oxide-DNA adducts induce mutations in the K-RAS oncogene and the TP53 tumorsuppressor gene in human lung tumors, and in corresponding genes in mouse-lung tumors. ANIMAL STUDIES: Animal studies demonstrate that exposure to benzo[a]pyrene is associated with developmental (including developmental neurotoxicity), reproductive, and immunological effects. Studies in multiple animal species demonstrate that benzo[a]pyrene is carcinogenic at multiple tumor sites (alimentary tract, liver, kidney, respiratory tract, pharynx, and skin) by all routes of exposure. BaP is primarily metabolized to diol epoxides, which react principally at N2-dG in DNA. BaP-N2-dG adducts have been shown to induce a variety of mutations, notably G-->T, G-->A, G-->C and -1 frameshifts. Oral exposure to BaP causes spermatogonial stem cell mutations in mice. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Thirty-four ducks were given single intratracheal dose of 50-200 mg benzo(a)pyrene. Survival rate was poor. One duck developed a lung carcinoma, and two had bronchial squamous metaplasia. Histological and skeletal examinations were performed on rainbow trout alevins reared in 0.00, 0.08, 0.21, 0.39, 1.48, 2.40, or 2.99 ng/mL aqueous benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). Nuclear pycnosis and karyorrhexis were most common in neuroectodermal and mesodermal derivatives and in liver of BaP-treated alevins. Microphthalmia was noted in 17% of the test fish and was frequently associated with a patent optic fissure. Depressed mitotic rates in the retina and brain, but not liver, were seen in alevins reared in 0.21 to 1.48 ng/mL aqueous BaP. Test alevins had a significantly higher incidence of skeletal malformations in the skull and vertebral column and abnormalities of vertebral arcualia often corresponded to areas of kyphoscoliotic flexures. In the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) teratogenic effect were related to embryonic cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as evidenced by the presence of aberrant chromosome arrangements during mitosis. Developmental abnormalities were observed in gastrulae treated with initial benzo(a)pyrene concentrations of 1-50 ng/mL.",

Many PAH's induce the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1, by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor or glycine N-methyltransferase protein. These enzymes metabolize PAH's into their toxic intermediates. The reactive metabolites of PAHs (epoxide intermediates, dihydrodiols, phenols, quinones, and their various combinations) covalently bind to DNA and other cellular macromolecules, initiating mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. The main carcinogenic metabolite of benzo(a)pyrene is the diol-epoxide trans-9,10-epoxy-7,8-dihydrodiol. (L10, L23, A27, A32)",

HPLC analysis of the mixtures indicated that preincubation of benzo[a]pyrene with 2-nitro-3,7,8-trichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin increased the quantity of benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol, and 9,10-dihydrodiol metabolites detected. The data suggest that nonmutagenic components of a complex mixture may alter the metabolism of promixate mutagens. Thus, in the present study, 2-nitro-3,7,8-trichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin appears to have inhibited the detoxication of benzo[a]pyrene metabolites.",

Blue mussels were exposed to either TiO2NP (0.2 and 2.0 mg/L) or B(a)P (20 ug/L) and to the respective combinations of these two compounds. Aqueous contaminant concentrations, the uptake of Ti and B(a)P into mussel soft tissue, effects on oxidative stress and chromosomal damage were analyzed. The uncoated TiO2NP agglomerated rapidly in the seawater. The presence of TiO2NP significantly reduced the bioavailability of B(a)P, shown by lowered B(a)P concentrations in exposure tanks and in mussel tissue. The activities of antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were impacted by the various exposure regimes, indicating oxidative stress in the contaminant exposure groups. While SOD activity was increased only in the 0.2TiO2NP exposure group, CAT activity was enhanced in both combined exposure groups. The GPx activity was increased only in the groups exposed to the two single compounds. In hemocytes, increased chromosomal damage was detected in mussels exposed to the single compounds, which was further increased after exposure to the combination of compounds. In this study we show that the presence of TiO2NP in the exposure system reduced B(a)P uptake in blue mussels. However, since most biomarker responses did not decrease despite of the lower B(a)P uptake in combined exposures, the results suggest that TiO2NP can act as additional stressor, or potentially alters B(a)P toxicity by activation.",

Benzo(e)pyrene appeared to reduce the incidence of carcinomas from 65% (benzo(a)pyrene alone) to 40% (benzo(a)pyrene plus benzo(e)pyrene).

In the smoker group, the PAH-DNA adduct content increases with the number of cigarettes. Thus, the relative staining intensity was 305 +/- 105 in the group smoking 1-10 cigarettes/day (n = 16), 347 +/- 77 in the 11-20 group (n = 14), and 386 +/- 112 in the group smoking more than 20 cigarettes/day (n = 3; P = 0.03 by nonparametric test for trend).

Deletion of 9p is one of the most frequent genomic alterations in bladder cancer. In addition, alterations of 9p21 and P16 are frequently seen in the epithelial cells of chronic smokers. This pilot study evaluated whether 9p21 aberrations induced by exposure in vitro to benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the metabolic product of benzo[a]pyrene, a constituent of tobacco smoke, were more common in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of 61 bladder cancer patients compared to 64 matched controls. /The authors hypothesize/ that 9p21 sensitivity to BPDE reflects the susceptibility of a specific locus to damage from carcinogens in tobacco smoke. /Investigators/ found that BPDE-induced chromosome band 9p21 aberrations were significantly higher in lymphocytes of bladder cancer cases (24.97 +/- 5.26 per 1,000) than in controls (20.72 +/- 4.51 per 1,000; P < 0.0001). However, no difference was observed for CEP9, a control locus. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and smoking status, 9p BPDE sensitivity had an odds ratio (OR) of 9.01 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3.75, 21.67] for bladder cancer. /Investigators/ further observed a gradient of elevated bladder cancer risk associated with increasing chromosomal damage. The adjusted ORs for subjects in the second, third, and highest quartiles of BPDE-induced 9p21 aberrations relative to the first quartile were 0.48 (0.04, 5.69), 5.14 (1.12, 23.59), and 21.51 (4.75, 97.34), respectively, providing increasing dose-response evidence of the locus-specific alterations. Thus, 9p21 may be a molecular target for BPDE-induced damage in bladder cancer cases. /Benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE)",

However, whether exposure to PAHs is associated with sperm telomere length (STL) has never been evaluated. The present study aimed to assess the potential association between PAHs exposure and STL, and to explore potential biomarkers that may predict the effects of low-level exposure to PAHs on human sperm. Questionnaires and biological samples were collected from 666 volunteers participating in the Male Reproductive Health in Chongqing College Students (MARHCS) cohort study in 2014. Semen parameters were measured for 656 participants, while urinary PAH metabolites, STL and sperm apoptosis were successfully measured for 492, 444 and 628 participants, respectively. The linear regression analysis revealed that increased levels of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHPyr) and 1-hydroxynapthalene (1-OHNap) were associated with decreased STL (-0.385; 95% CI, -0.749, -0.021 for 1-OHPyr; and -0.079; 95% CI, -0.146, -0.011 for 1-OHNap). The significant negative associations remained after adjusting for potential confounders. However, no significant associations were observed between urinary PAH metabolites and semen quality or sperm apoptosis. We also administrated rats with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P; 0, 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg) for 4 weeks and found shorter STL and decreased telomerase expression in germ cells in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, environmental exposure to some PAHs may be associated with decreased human STL, and the in vivo animal results also demonstrate the adverse effects of B[a]P on telomere of male germ cells.",

Therefore a change in the level of DNA methylation of whole genome has been considered as a biomarker of carcinogenesis. Previously, a large number of experimental results in genetic toxicology have showed that benzo[a]pyrene could cause DNA mutation and fragmentation. However, there was little to no studies on alterations in DNA methylation of genome directly result from exposure to benzo[a]pyrene. In this paper, possible mechanisms of alterations in whole genomic DNA methylation by benzo[a]pyrene were investigated using ICR mice after benzo[a]pyrene exposure. The blood, liver, pancreas, skin, lung and bladder of ICR mice were removed and checked after a fixed time interval (6 hours) of benzo[a]pyrene exposure, and whole genomic DNA methylation level was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results exhibited tissue specificity, that is, the level of whole genomic DNA methylation decreases significantly in blood and liver, rather than pancreas, lung, skin and bladder of ICR mice. This study investigated the direct relationship between aberrant DNA methylation level and benzo[a]pyrene exposure, which might be helpful to clarify the toxicological mechanism of benzo[a]pyrene in epigenetic perspectives.",

PAH exposure causes developmental toxicity in multiple fish species, while acute adult fish toxicity is thought to be minimal. The literature increasingly suggests sublethal PAH effects may occur, but differences in exposure route may confound conclusions. We hypothesized that acute PAH exposure in adult fish will cause cardiorespiratory impairment that will not differ with exposure route. In order to investigate this hypothesis, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were injected intraperitoneal (i.p.) twice with increasing concentrations of the prototypical PAH, benzo-a-pyrene (BaP; 0.1, 10, and 1000 ug/kg) or exposed aqueously (static, renewal at 24 hr; 16.2 and 162 ug/L) for 48 hr and compared to corresponding dimethylsulfoxide controls. No mortalities or significant effects on weight of the fish were noted at any exposure concentration or route. At 48 hr, fish were subjected to swimming tests with concurrent oxygen consumption measurement (n=10 fish/treatment) or echocardiography (n=12 fish/treatment). Oxygen consumption (MO2) was increased at three swimming speeds in BaP-injected groups compared to control (p<0.01 in Fisher's LSD tests after two-way ANOVA). In contrast, aqueously BaP-exposed fish showed increased MO2 under only basal conditions. Despite increased oxygen demand, ventricular heart rate was significantly decreased in BaP-exposed fish, both injected and aqueously-exposed. Analysis of BaP body burdens in fish tissue allowed for identification of an overlapping dose group between exposure routes, through which comparisons of cardiorespiratory toxicity were then made. This comparison revealed most effects were similar between the two exposures routes, although minor differences were noted. At similar BaP body burdens, injected fish suffered from more severe bradycardia than aqueously exposed fish and had greater levels of increases in cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) mRNA levels in liver and heart tissue compared to aqueous exposed fish. In conclusion, acute BaP exposure in adult zebrafish had negative effects on cardiorespiratory function. Differences in effect between exposure routes were attributed primarily to differences in bioavailability, since overall, similar effects were noted between the two exposure routes when similar BaP body burdens were achieved.",

Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is one of the most potent tobacco smoke carcinogens in tobacco smoke. BaP induced DNA damage and over expression in p53 cervical tissue of mice as demonstrated in our previous study. Here we present the findings of exposure to BaP on the expression of Bcl-2, C-myc, Ki-67, Caspase-3 and Bax genes in mouse cervix. Acute intraperitoneal administration of BaP (12.5, 25, 50, 100 mg/kg body weight) to ICR female mice induced a significant increase in Bcl-2, C-myc, Ki-67 mRNA and protein level till 72 hr except in Bcl-2 at 24h with 12.5, 25, 50 mg/kg as well as at 48hr with 12.5 mg/kg body weight post treatment. A significant increase was also seen in Caspase-3 and Bax mRNA and protein level with peak level at 24 hr and gradual decrease till 72 hr, however, the expression of caspase-3 increased while that of Bax decreased with increasing dose of Bap after 24 hr. In sub chronic intraperitoneal and oral gavage administration of BaP (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg body weight), similar significant increase was observed for all the examined genes as compared to the control and vehicle groups, however the expression of Bax decreased in a dose dependent manner.",

Naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, chrysene, and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) were administered to rats for 3 days (25-128 mg/kg/day) and the responses compared with those of model /CYP/ inducers. PAH treatment increased the CYP1A-catalyzed activity of pyrene 1-hydroxylation and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation in rat liver by up to 28- and 279-fold, and in rat lung by up to 22- and 51-fold, respectively. 1-Naphthol (hUGT1A6), 1-hydroxypyrene (hUGT1A6/1A9), and entacapone (hUGT1A9) are markers of PAH-glucuronidating human uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT). These activities increased up to 6.4-fold in rat liver and up to 1.9-fold in rat lung. NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferase activities increased up to 5.3- and 1.6-fold (liver), and up to 4.4- and 1.4-fold (lung), respectively. CYP1A showed the best liver-to-lung relationship (R (2 )=( )0.90). The inducing efficiency by PAHs differed extensively: control < chrysene << pyrene phenanthrene, naphthalene>60-fold), many times greater than the experimental (inducible/constitutive) variation in the rat. Kinetics of 1-hydroxypyrene glucuronidation showed two low-K (m) forms both in rat and human lung. Since the 2-4-ring PAHs (major constituents) were poor enzyme inducers, it appears that the PAH-metabolizing pathways are mainly induced by BaP-type minor constituents. ...",

Subchronic exposure to BaP resulted in a BaP dose-dependent increase in protection to Listeria monocytogenes infection. Exposure to BaP caused a dose-dependent increase in the pulmonary tumor burden of mice administered B16F10 melanoma cells intravenously 1 day after the last BaP exposure. Exposure to BaP caused a decrease in resistance to Herpes Simplex Type 2 virus (not dose-dependent) and Streptococcus pneumonia (dose-dependent).

Groups of 8-12 rats each were immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) on day 10 or 11 of exposure and the humoral immune response was evaluated by measuring the spleen IgM antibody forming cells (AFC) response 1 day after the last exposure to BaP. Significant decreases were observed in the number of AFC in animals treated with BaP and SRBC when compared to solvent controls. Delayed hypersensitivity response to SRBC was suppressed in high-dose female and male animals to a level of 59% and 45% of controls, respectively. The ability of male and female mice to produce antibodies to the T-dependent antigen sheep erythrocytes was inhibited although the parameters used to measure the functional aspects of cell mediated immunity were unaltered. BaP treatment also resulted in a suppression in the bacterial lipopolysaccharide response which was more intense for females. No differences were observed between BaP treated and control animals in the following: basal serum immunoglobulin levels, serum complement levels, delayed hypersensitivity response to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin, acute inflammatory response to carrageenin, and vascular clearance of rate of sheep erythrocytes.

To test the hypothesis that genetically determined apoptotic capacity (AC) is associated with risk of lung cancer, /investigators/ conducted a pilot case-control study of 68 patients with newly diagnosed, untreated lung cancer and 74 cancer-free controls. /The authors/ measured the AC of their cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to in vitro exposure to an ultimate tobacco carcinogen, benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), by using terminal dUTP nucleotide end labeling and flow cytometry. /The authors/ also investigated the frequency of the -A670G polymorphism in Fas, a gene involved in controlling the apoptotic pathway, by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. After exposing the cells to 4 uM BPDE for 5 hr, /investigators/ observed a significantly lower AC in lung cancer patients (155.2+/-143.9%) than in the controls (216.6+/-184.6%) (P<0.05). Low AC was an independent risk factor (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.18-6.15) for lung cancer after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status and apoptotic baseline in a logistic regression model. Although the Fas -A670G polymorphism was not an independent risk factor for lung cancer, it appeared to modulate the risk. The adjusted ORs for lung cancer risk associated with lower AC were 4.00 (95% CI=1.48-10.80) among those with the Fas -670 AG and GG genotypes and 0.97 (95% CI=0.18-5.30) among those with the Fas -670AA genotype. These data suggest that alteration in the apoptotic pathway may be a risk factor for lung cancer and this risk may be modulated by the Fas -A670G polymorphism. /Benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE)/",

In contrast, 39% of 23 biopsy specimens from 5 normal persons showed an average metabolic activity, 2.79 nmol. Benzo[a]pyrene oxidation activity in colonic tissue from colitis patients was, on the average, fourfold greater than that in normal subjects. This study suggest that the colonic mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis has a greater ability than that of normal subjects to oxidize such chemicals possibly to electrophiles with higher mutagenic potential.",

Nineteen known transcripts and seven predicted proteins were found from the subtractive cDNA library of the clam, which could provide more sequence information for further study. Seven of the differentially expressed genes were selected for mRNA expression analysis. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression level of the selected cDNAs of clams was up-regulated to varying degrees by different concentration of BaP. They are suggested as potential molecular biomarkers for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pollution monitoring in aquatic ecosystems. In addition, hemocyte parameters were also measured, and a decrease of total hemocyte counts and suppression of antibacterial and bacteriolytic activities were detected in BaP-stressed clams. We suggest that the modulation of the expression of the selected genes caused by PAHs probably leads to the disturbance of the immune defense of the clam. Meanwhile, the adverse effects of PAHs on hemocyte parameters caused the suppression of the immune defense and susceptibility to infectious diseases. Therefore, it is inferred that PAHs pollutants could interact with components of the immune system and interferes with defense functions of the clam V. philippinarum.",

In the present study we investigated whether trout liver contains an IHIC population, and if so, what the relative cellular composition of this population is. The results provide clear evidence for the existence of an IHIC population in trout liver, which constitutes 15-29% of the non-hepatocytes in the liver, and with a cellular composition different to that of the blood leukocyte population. We analyzed the response of IHICs to a non-infectious liver challenge with the hepatotoxic and immunotoxic chemical, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). Juvenile trout were treated with BaP (25 or 100 mg/kg bw) at levels sufficient to induce the molecular pathway of BaP metabolism while not causing pathological and inflammatory liver changes. The IHIC population responded to the BaP treatments in a way that differed from the responses of the leukocyte populations in trout blood and spleen, suggesting that IHICs are an independently regulated immune cell population.",

The Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) is an important contaminant, commonly present in the marine environment. Pollutants are generally metabolized by enzymes of phase I, mainly CYPs enzymes, and by conjugation enzymes of phase II like GST. In this study, we investigated by Real Time PCR the expression of CYP4 and GSTr (GST class rho) in the digestive gland of V. philippinarum exposed to different concentrations of B(a)P for 24 hr and after a 24 hr depuration period. Accumulation of B(a)P by clams has been confirmed by the HPLC-FLD analyses. Moreover, HPLC-FLD analyses evidenced that after depuration, B(a)P concentrations decreased in animals subjected to 0.03 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L exposures but did not decrease in animals subjected to 1 mg/l exposure. B(a)P exposure and depuration did not cause histopathological lesions in the different organs. The analysis of GSTr expression in the digestive gland showed a significant increase in mRNA in animals subjected to 1 mg/L exposure, whereas the analysis of CYP4 expression did not evidence differences among treatments. Moreover, the expression of both genes did not exhibit any differences after the purification treatment. The results demonstrate that B(a)P significantly affects the expression of GSTr mRNA in the digestive gland of V. philippinarum and suggest that GSTr gene could play an important role in the biotransformation of B(a)P.",

                                                    "String": "Benzo(a)pyrene is a member of a group of chemicals called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). It occurs ubiquitously as a product of incomplete combustion. It has been identified in cigarette smoke, gasoline and diesel engine exhaust, used motor oils, gasolines, charcoal-broiled steaks, various processed foods, margarine, butter, fats, fruits, vegetables, and cereals, roasted coffee and tea. Benzo(a)pyrene occurs in fossil fuels, crude oils, shale oils, and coal tars, and is emitted with gases and fly ash from active volcanoes and waste incinerators. Benzo(a)pyrene's production and use in dyes and as a laboratory agent may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 5.49X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzo(a)pyrene will exist primarily in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. However, a small percentage will exist in the vapor phase. Benzo(a)pyrene has been shown to undergo gas/particle partitioning in the environment as part of its atmospheric global distribution. Both vapor-phase and particulate-phase benzo(a)pyrene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-lives for each of these reactions in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours. Particulate-phase benzo(a)pyrene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benzo(a)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzo(a)pyrene is expected to have slight to no mobility based upon measured soil Koc values ranging from 3,760 to 1.3X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.57X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. The persistence of benzo(a)pyrene in soil is expected to vary depending upon the nature of compounds accompanying it and the nature and previous history of the soil. Biodegradation half-lives of 309 and 229 days were observed in Kidman and McLaurin sandy loam soils, respectively. PAHs with four or more rings, such as benzo(a)pyrene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation. Benzo(a)pyrene is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight. The photolysis half-life of benzo(a)pyrene on spruce needle surfaces exposed to full sunlight in Munich, Germany in July 2001 was 33 hours. If released into water, benzo(a)pyrene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon measured Koc values. Biodegradation may occur very slowly in natural waters. Mineralization half-lives >200 weeks have been observed in sediment/water microcosm studies. Faster biodegradation rates can occur in acclimated media. Half-lives of 12-23 days have been measured using river water/sediment collected from PAH polluted areas of the Yellow River, China. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. BCF values of 480 and 490 in fish suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to benzo(a)pyrene may occur through inhalation of particulates and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzo(a)pyrene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzo(a)pyrene via inhalation of tobacco smoke and ambient air, inhalation of exhaust from cooking processes that produce smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with soil, road and house dust and other entities contaminated or containing benzo(a)pyrene(SRC). The general population can also be exposed to benzo(a)pyrene through pharmaceutical products based on coal tar that are applied to the skin. (SRC)",

Volatilization of benzo(a)pyrene from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 4.57X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(4). Benzo(a)pyrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an extrapolated vapor pressure of 5.49X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5). The persistence of benzo(a)pyrene in soil is expected to vary depending upon the nature of compounds accompanying it and the nature and previous history of the soil(6). Biodegradation half-lives of 309 and 229 days were observed for benzo(a)pyrene in Kidman and McLaurin sandy loam soils, respectively(7). Cumulative 14-CO2 evolution from soil microcosm spiked with 14C-benzo(a)pyrene reached only 3% after 42 days of incubation(8). PAHs with four or more rings, such as benzo(a)pyrene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation(9). Benzo(a)pyrene is susceptible to direct photolysis(10) on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight. The photolysis half-life of benzo(a)pyrene on spruce needle surfaces exposed to full sunlight in Munich, Germany in July 2001 was 33 hours(11).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.57X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(5). According to a classification scheme(6), measured BCF values of 490 in bluegill sunfish(7) and 480 in golden ide fish(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). However, benzo(a)pyrene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(9). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 1.1 days has been reported for benzo(a)pyrene(10). PAHs with four or more rings, such as benzo(a)pyrene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation(11). Half-lives for the mineralization of (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene in sediment/water microcosms ranged from >200 weeks in Redfish Bay, TX to >300 weeks in Lake Chicot, AR(12). In acclimated media, biodegradation can occur at a faster rate. The biodegradation half-life of benzo(a)pyrene (at 1.12 ug/L) ranged from about 12-23 days using river water, with and without sediment, collected from PAH polluted areas of the Yellow River, China(13). Benzo(a)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(14) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on water surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC). Benzo(a)pyrene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4).",

Based on an estimated super-cooled vapor pressure of 1.8X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(3), a small percentage of benzo(a)pyrene is expected to exist in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere(1). Benzo(a)pyrene has been shown to undergo gas/particle partitioning in the environment as part of its atmospheric global distribution(4). Vapor-phase benzo(a)pyrene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase benzo(a)pyrene is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is also estimated to be 7.7 hours(SRC), calculated from a measured rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(5). Particulate-phase benzo(a)pyrene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Benzo(a)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(6,7) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The persistence of benzo(a)pyrene in soil is expected to vary depending upon the nature of compounds accompanying it and the nature and previous history of the soil(1). After 5 days incubation in activated sludge, <0.1% of the applied (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene concentration was degraded to (14)-CO2(2). Incubation of (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene in creosote-pentachlorophenol contaminated soil over 285 days led to a small, <1%, mineralization of benzo(a)pyrene(3). Calculated half-lives for the mineralization of (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene in sediment/water microcosms ranged from >200 weeks in Redfish Bay, TX to >300 weeks in Lake Chicot, AR; no mineralization was detected in microcosms containing sediment and water from DeGray Reservoir, AR(4). The extent of mineralization of (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene, at a concentration of 105 ng/g, in soils collected from an abandoned coal tar refinery was very low, <8%, after 160 days(5). The level of indigenous mineralization of (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene in soils obtained from three abandoned coal gasification plants as measured by serum bottle respirometry ranged from not detectable to 25% following incubations >180 days; (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene mineralization occurred after a 28-day lag period(6). In soils from Alert (contaminated with Arctic diesel fuel), Saglek (from a radar installation), Varta (from a former gasworks site), and Westbrook (not known to be polluted), the percent removal of benzo(a)pyrene (10 ug/mL concentration) from enrichment cultures after 90 days incubation under aerobic conditions were, respectively: at 20 \u00b0C, 68, 76, 60, and 27; at 7 \u00b0C, 33, 31, 34 and 37(7). The biodegradation half-life of benzo(a)pyrene (at 1.12 ug/L) ranged from about 12-23 days using river water, with and without sediment, collected from PAH polluted areas of the Yellow River, China(8). Cumulative 14-CO2 evolution from soil microcosm spiked with 14C-benzo(a)pyrene reached about 3% after 42 days of incubation(8).",

In a pilot biotreatability study, benzo(a)pyrene was reduced 99.9% by a sequencing batch reactor(2). In soil-water slurry systems, with actual town gas soil, benzo(a)pyrene was biodegraded approximately 22% after 5 weeks incubation using a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-acclimated mixed culture(3). In bench-scale biotreatability studies using a solid-phase bioremediation process (landfarming chambers containing sediment and soil collected from the American Creosote Works Superfund site, Pensacola, FL), the benzo(a)pyrene concentration was reduced from 84.3 to 63.6 in unamended surface soil; 84.3 to 47.7 in nutrient-amended surface soil; 246.6 to 183.6 in unamended sediment; and 246.6 to 178.8 mg/L and farming chamber in nutrient-amended sediment following 12 weeks incubation(4). In shake flask studies, an initial benzo(a)pyrene concentration of 2.1 ug/mL was reduced to 0.9 ug/mL following 2 weeks incubation in contaminated groundwater inoculated with indigenous soil microorganisms from the American Creosote Works Superfund site, Pensacola, FL(5). After 60 days of batch slurry bioremediation, the initial solid-phase benzo(a)pyrene concn of 56 ug/g was reduced to 25.2 ug/g, a 55% removal(6). In a soil column study containing sandy soil samples from a site contaminated with creosote, an initial benzo(a)pyrene concentration of approximately 120 mg/kg was reduced to about 100 mg/kg following 170 days incubation(7). Half-lives derived for benzo(a)pyrene in four soils amended with sewage sludge ranged from 120 to 270 days, with a mean half-life of 211 days(8). 64% benzo(a)pyrene removal over 36 days in an activated sludge pilot reactor was attributed to biodegradation(9). No significant degradation of benzo(a)pyrene was observed in soil obtained from a former tar-oil refinery following 8 weeks of incubation in a percolator(10). In soil classified as an Orthic Luvisol (>70% silt, >20% clay), benzo(a)pyrene declined from the applied 10.8 to 4.3 mg/kg in 27.5 months; the soil half-life was determined to be 2.7 years(11). Mean estimated half-lives for sludge applied benzo(a)pyrene to Lee Valley and Luddington, UK soils were 3.2 and 8.2 years, respectively; biodegradation is suspected to be the most important loss process in these soils(12). Biodegradation rates of benzo(a)pyrene in Boston Harbor sediments ranged from 0.15 to 49.5 ng/g-hr; these values correspond to turnover rates of 53.7 to 82.3 days(13). Biodegradation half-lives of 309 and 229 days were observed for benzo(a)pyrene in Kidman and McLaurin sandy loam soils, respectively(14).",

The rate constant for the particulate-phase reaction of benzo(a)pyrene (adsorbed to airborne soot) with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals has been experimentally measured to be about 5X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec(2). These rate constants correspond to an atmospheric half-life of about 7.7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Benzo(a)pyrene adsorbed to airborne particulate matter has been shown to react with ozone(2), however, the rate is not competitive with OH radicals(SRC). Benzo(a)pyrene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

The photolysis half-life of benzo(a)pyrene in solution containing 50 uM riboflavin was 5 minutes, compared to 98 minutes in the absence of riboflavin; the half-life was 10.6 and 43.1 minutes when exposed to visible range of natural sunlight and UVA irradiation, respective(3). The photolysis half-life of benzo(a)pyrene on spruce needle surfaces exposed to full sunlight in Munich, Germany in July 2001 was 33 hours(4). Half-lives for the direct photochemical decomposition of benzo(a)pyrene in freshwater were computed to be: 0.54 hours near the surface of freshwater (simulated latitude, 40 deg N, mid-day, mid-summer); 3.2 hours at a depth of 5 m; and 13 hours at a depth of 5 m and partitioned to bottom sediment(5). After 17 hours irradiation with light >290 nm, 26.5% of benzo(a)pyrene adsorbed onto silica gel was degraded(6). A near-surface direct photolysis half-life of 32 minutes was observed for benzo(a)pyrene in water in the summer at 40 deg N latitude(7). Photolysis of (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene in methanolic solution with or without 0.1 M hydrogen peroxide under either UV light (300 nm) or natural sunlight transformed benzo(a)pyrene to polar materials subject to increased mineralization(8). After 2 hours irradiation at 300 nm, over 68% of the benzo(a)pyrene remained in methanol solution; 0.1 M hydrogen peroxide greatly enhanced the rate of degradation (half-life decreased to 20 min)(7). Half-lives of benzo(a)pyrene adsorbed onto clean glass-fiber filters and two dust loaded filters (0.23 and 0.69 mg/sq cm) and exposed to a UV lamp were 37, 199, and 428 minutes, respectively(9). A photolysis half-life of 0.48 hours was measured for benzo(a)pyrene in pure water following exposure to mid-summer sunlight; in coal-oil saturated water, the half-life increased to 5 hours(10).",

Irradiation of benzo(a)pyrene adsorbed onto silica gel, alumina, fly ash, and carbon black, with a mercury vapor lamp yielded photolysis half-lives of 4.7, 1.4, 31, and 570 hours, respectively(2), indicating adsorption may affect photodegradation(SRC). Dark-corrected photolysis half-lives for benzo(a)pyrene adsorbed onto fly ash and irradiated with a mercury vapor lamp ranged from 28 to 805 hours; dark-corrected photolysis half-lives for benzo(a)pyrene adsorbed onto silica gel and alumina were 2.7 and 1.0 hours, respectively(3). Data for the oxidation rates of benzo(a)pyrene coated on quartz surface and exposed to ozone or sunlight are presented; from about eight products detected in these experiments, three have been identified as quinones based on UV-absorption spectrometry and mass spectrometry(4). After 30 minutes exposure to gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide, benzo(a)pyrene deposited on glass-fiber filters gave significant yields of nitro derivatives; 6-nitrobenzo(a)pyrene was the main isomer formed, the 1 and 3 isomers were formed in much lower yields(5). Benzo(a)pyrene was more resistant to photochemical transformation when adsorbed onto eight stack ashes from coal burning (-4 to 53% change) than when adsorbed onto alumina, silica gel, or controlled-porosity glass (60,93, and 96% change, respectively)(6).",

A 14C-radio-labeled benzo(a)pyrene BCF of 4,900 was determined in bluegill (whole body) based on total radio-labeled carbon (14C) activity; however, the BCF based only on the parent compound was approximately 490(2). A BCF of 480 was measured in golden ide fish(Leuciscus idus melanotus) after 3 days exposure to (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these BCF values (for the parent benzo(a)pyrene) suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, benzo(a)pyrene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(5). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 1.1 days has been reported for benzo(a)pyrene(6).",

BCFs in the clam Macoma inquinata were 861 from 7 days exposure to 0.0004 ppm benzo(a)pyrene via the overlying water column and 0.09 from exposure to oil-contaminated sediments, 0.64 ppm benzo(a)pyrene, for 7 days(3). BCFs of 8.7, 240 and 190 were measured in the bivalve Rangia cuneata over a period of 1 day using a benzo(a)pyrene water concentration of 0.052, 0.030 and 0.030 ppm(3). The bioaccumulation of benzo(a)pyrene by Daphnia magna from five lake waters was inversely correlated with the dissolved organic carbon concentration of the waters(4). The BCF in Daphnia magna in artificial humus-free control water was approximately 3400; in lake waters having a DOC of 1.2, 4.6, 6.5, 6.6, and 20.3 mg C/L the BCFs were approximately 3400, 2600, 2200, 2300, and 500, respectively(4). BCFs for benzo(a)pyrene, based on dry weight, in mussels incubated in Port Phillip Bay, Australia ranged from 1.3X10+4 to 1.8X10+4 (in water with no direct source of hydrocarbons), 7.0X10+3 to 8.0X10+3 (in areas where the main sources of hydrocarbons is urban drainage), and 1.2X10+5 to 3.1X10+5 (in sites close to the discharge of a major oil refinery)(5). Mean benzo(a)pyrene concentrations in the amphipod Diporeia following 2 days exposure to sediment-sorbed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were 32, 20, and 24 nmol/g for sediments aged 3, 60, and 150 days, respectively; following 28 days exposure, concentrations were 302, 202, and 151 nmol/g for sediments aged 3, 60, and 150 days, respectively(6).

Average annual uptake and depuration rate constants at 4 \u00b0C for benzo(a)pyrene in Pontoporeia hoyi (Great Lakes amphipod) were 116.8 mL/g hr and 0.0016/hour, respectively(2). Lumbriculus variegatus (freshwater oligochaete) accumulated sediment-associated (3)H-benzo(a)pyrene rapidly and achieved steady state within 96 to 168 hours; uptake clearance was 0.069 g sediment/g h(3). Elimination of (3)H-benzo(a)pyrene in clean sediment was rapid, but elimination in water was slower; elimination rate constants were 0.0229/hr for sediment and 0.0004/hr for water-only depuration(3). After 30 days exposure to (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene adsorbed onto sediment an initial uptake rate constant of 18/hr was measured in Brachydanio rerio (zebra fish); depuration half-lives relative to clean and contaminated water were 138 hours(4). In laboratory microcosms, benzo(a)pyrene was rapidly accumulated by Chironomus riparius (midge) incubated in sediments spiked with benzo(a)pyrene; mean concentrations in chironomids ranged from 12 ug/kg in controls to 6,030 ug/kg in benzo(a)pyrene treatments(5). A BCF (chemical concentration in tissue/free and bound chemical concentration in interstitial water) of approximately 1X10+5 was measured in the amphipod Rhepoxynius abronius after 10 days exposure to benzo(a)pyrene(6). Elimination half-lives of 16 and 4.8, 7, 21.7, and 8.0 days were measured in Mytilus edilus (blue mussels), Abarenicola pacifica (polychaete), Crassotrea virginica (Eastern oyster), and Mercenaria mercenaria (clam), respectively(6). Clams, Macoma nasuta, exposed to field-contaminated sediments for 28 days contained benzo(a)pyrene at mean concentrations ranging from 1.4 to 66 ng/g dry weight(7). The bioconcentration factor for total activity was measured for (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene at 1119 and 3068 in freshwater amphopods (Gammarus fossarun) and isopods (Asellus aquaticus), respectively(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Kd, soil/water partition coefficients, of 18.2 and 69.0 were determined in Kidman sandy loam (0.51% organic carbon) and Nunn clay loam (1.1% organic carbon)(2) which correspond to Koc values of 3760 and 6270, respectively(SRC). According to a recommended classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggest that benzo(a)pyrene is expected to have slight to no mobility in soil(SRC). Sorption coefficients (Kp) for benzo(a)pyrene obtained during 48 hour batch experiments using two lake sediments with organic carbon content of 1.87 and 2.07%, and a high chemical concentration were 7,000 and 22,000, respectively(4). Sorption coefficients obtained from 48 hour batch experiments using a low benzo(a)pyrene concentration were 8,700 and 35,000 using lake sediments with 1.87% and 2.07% organic carbon, respectively(4). These lake sediment Kp values correspond to Koc values of 2.7X10+5, 1.1X10+6, 4.7X10+5, and 1.7X10+6(SRC). Measured log Koc values ranged from 6.00 to 6.28 in sediments and porewater isolated from three cores from Boston Harbor, MA(5). Sorption partition coefficients for benzo(a)pyrene with natural dissolved organic carbon from Lake Ketelmeer ranged from 2.8X10+6 at 45 \u00b0C to 1.6X10+7 at 16 \u00b0C(6). A sorption partition coefficient of 2.5X10+6 was observed for benzo(a)pyrene with particulate organic matter from Lake Ketelmeer at 20 \u00b0C(6). Average partition coefficients for benzo(a)pyrene in natural interstitial waters ranged from 2.2X10+3 and 9.0X10+6 for Government Pond, Grand Haven, MI and Lake Michigan, respectively(7). Sorption of (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene on sediment collected in the harbor of Rotterdam was measured using batch experiments; cosolvent partition coefficients ranged from log 5.2 to 6.3(8). Partition coefficients (log) for (14)C-benzo(a)pyrene using fulvic and humic acids derived from salt-marsh estuaries ranged from 3.48 to 3.86 and 4.12 to 4.29, respectively(9). Benzo(a)pyrene log Kp values ranged from 5.18 to 5.79 in porewater and 4.90 to 5.36 in elutriates(10).",

Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in treated surface waters used as drinking waters (in parts per trillion): River Rhine, 0.5, Lake Constance, 1.7, English River, 9(1). In Germany in 1968, samples of groundwater and tap water contained benzo(a)pyrene at concentrationss of 0.4-3.8 and 0.5-4.0 ug/cu m, respectively(2). Drinking water from the Netherlands contained an avergae 2 parts per trillion benzo(a)pyrene, and a maximum of 15 parts per trillion(3). In the UK between 1974 and 1975, 7 distributed treated surface water systems contained benzo(a)pyrene at trace to <3 parts per trillion; in 8 groundwater distribution systems between 1974 and 1977, trace to <10 parts per trillion, max during repair work on parts of 1 system, 101 parts per trillion(4). In Norway, 4 samples contained benzo(a)pyrene at <0.05 to 0.29 parts per trillion(5). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in one of three tap water samples collected from Jiangsu Province, China in October 2010 at a level of 0.4 ng/L(6).",

The benzo(a)pyrene mean (max) concentration (ug/L) detected in surface water of four rivers in Hangzhou, China, collected in July and November 1999-2002 were, respectively: Qiantang River, 3.575 (10.10), and 0.835 (2.785); Hangzhou Canal, 1.949 (6.640), and 0.402 (1.981); Inland River, 1.129 (6.686), and 1.314 (3.889); West Lake, 3.100 (10.22), and 0.349 (1.658)(2). Water samples collected from three drains, and from Lake Manzala, located at the northeastern edge of the Nile Delta in Egypt, contained benzo(a)pyrene at concentrations ranging from 31.0 to 460.0 ng/L(3). Water samples from four rivers in Germany contained 0.6 to 80 parts per trillion, average 23 parts per trillion; 2 rivers in the USSR contained 17 and 10 parts per trillion; and water from 3 stations on the Thames River, UK, 0.13 to 0.35 ug/L, average 0.21 ug/L benzo(a)pyrene(4). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in water from 6 sites on 4 rivers in Germany between 1963-64 at 0.6-114.0 parts per trillion; from 5 sites in the USSR at <0.1-13,000 parts per trillion; from 5 sites at Severn River in the UK at 1.5-13.5 parts per trillion; Thames River, 2 sites, 130-210 parts per trillion; River Trent and tributaries, 11 sites, 0.1-1.8 parts per trillion in solution; and in suspended solids (max River Trent at Keadby) at 0.8-504.0 parts per trillion(5). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in 51 samples from 25 sites on 9 rivers in the UK between 1973-76 at 3.8 to 531 parts per trillion(6). Water samples from the rivers Gersprenz, Danube, Main, Aach and Schussen in Germany detected benzo(a)pyrene at concentrations of 9.6, 0.6, 1.1-43, 4-16, and 10 ng/L, respectively(7). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in water samples collected from the Huaihe River, China, in summer 2002 at concentrations from 0.55 to 1.56 ug/L(8). Benzo(a)pyrene concentrations ranged from 0 to 20 ng/L in six stations located in the Guanabara Bay Basin, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, sampled from September 2011 to August 2012(9).",

The concentration of benzo(a)pyrene in Lake Superior water was 0.39 ng/L(2). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in samples collected from the Otonabee River, Ontario, Canada in 1994 at concentrations ranging from 0.0080 to 0.0275 ug/mL(3). Mississippi river water samples collected between March-August 2004 detected benzo(a)pyrene at concentrations of 1.6-20.5 parts per trillion(4). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in water samples from the Mississippi River at concentrations of 1 and 10 ng/L for samples collected near the inflow of the Ohio River and 20 miles below Memphis, TN, respectively(5). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected but not quantified in water and suspended sediment samples from Fort Erie and Niagara-on-the-Lake between December 1984 and March 1986(6). Benzo(a)pyrene has been reported in the following Great Lakes Basin ecosystems: Lake Ontario (Niagara River), Lake Erie (Union Ship Canal; Buffalo River; Smoke Creek; Cuyahago River; Rocky River), Lake Michigan (Muskegon River, St. Joseph River), and Lake Superior (St. Louis River, western basin)(7). In 1990 and 1992, the average benzo(a)pyrene concentration in surface water (3 m depth) and bottom water (2 m above bottom) of the mesohaline Chesapeake Bay was 0.27 and 0.93 ng/L, respectively(8). Prior to 1985, the US STORET Database reported that of surface water samples from 914 water stations, 2% contained benzo(a)pyrene at a median concentration of <10 ppb(9). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in 9.4% of 85 water samples collected from 139 streams in 30 states during 1999 and 2000, at maximum and median concentrations of 0.24 and 0.04 ug/L, respectively(10).",

Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in farmland ditch water at a mean concentration of 0.10 ug/L and railway right-of-way ditch water at mean concentrations of 43 and 0.10 ug/L for ditches with and without utility poles, respectively(3). 4% of the National Urban Runoff Program's 86 samples from 15 cities contained benzo(a)pyrene at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 ppb(4). Samples of urban runoff collected in Madrid contained benzo(a)pyrene at a mean annual concentration of 1.1 ug/L(5). Samples from Bekkelaget Sewage Treatment Plant in Oslo, Norway, contained <3 to 5 parts per trillion benzo(a)pyrene(6). Prior to 1985, the US STORET Database, 2.3% of 1253 water stations contained benzo(a)pyrene at a median concentration of <10 ppb(7). Those industries with mean raw or treated wastewater concentration exceeding 100 ppb include (max raw wastewater benzo(a)pyrene concentartion, ppb): coal mining (140), iron and steel manufacturing (14,000), nonferrous metals manufacturing (570), and timber products processing (2,700)(8). Industrial effluents detected benzo(a)pyrene in: shale oil, after dephenolization (2, 312 ppb); gasworks, after filtration through coke bed (20 ppb) and after dephenolization (290 ppb); coke by-products after biochemical treatment (12-16 ppb); oil refineries (0.05-5.0 ppb); wood preservative sludge (3.39 g/L raw sludge); domestic effluent (0.038-0.074 ppb); final effluent of sewage works (0.03 ppb); sewage (high percentage industry, 0.1-0.36 ppb); sewage during dry weather (0.001 ppb); sewage during heavy rain (1.84 ppb); primary and digested raw sewage sludge (0.27-0.57 ppm); liquors from sewage sludge heat-treatment plants (0.03-0.84 ppm); sludge cake from heat-treatment plants (0.31-0.52 ppm); storm runoff waters from M-6 motorway in the UK in 1986 (13 ng/L average)(9).",

Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in emissions from a cast iron (sheet iron) wood stove burning different types of fuels, mg/cu m: virgin beech wood, 0.024 to 0.084 (0.118 to 0.688); briquettes made of wood chips, 0.177 to 0.281 (1.36 to 1.85); scrap wood, 0.191 to 0.652 (0.771 to 0.882); briquettes made of sorted domestic waste, 0.008 to 0.019 (0.059 to 0.262); pine wood preserved with pentachlorophenol, 0.298 to 0.760 (0.436 to 0.760); and rolled up newspapers, 0.036 to 0.055 (0.107 to 0.120)(2). Flue gases from a large incinerator plant in Italy contained benzo(a)pyrene at a concentration of 4400 ng/normalized cu m(3). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in 7.5% of water samples collected upstream, downstream, and from the effluent from 10 wastewater treatment plants in the US, at a median concentrations level below the reporting level of 0.5 ug/L, and a max concentartion of 0.084 ug/L(4). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in 9.1% of 23 high-flow water samples collected up- and down-stream from 10 cities in Iowa in 2001, with a max concentrations of 0.06 ug/L; it was not detected in normal- and low-flow samples(5). In air samples collected between 1961 and 2004, benzo(a)pyrene was detected in 8 US vehicular traffic tunnels that were either directly presented as tailpipe emission factors in ug/vehicle-km or convertible to such a form; emissions for a tunnel fleet operating under cruise conditions were highest prior to the 1980's and fell from >30 ug/vehicle-km to approx 2 ug/km in the 1990's(6).",

Bed sediments collected along a contamination gradient in the Lauritzen Canal, CA in 1993 contained benzo(a)pyrene at concentrations ranging from 150 to 1770 ng/g; the highest concentration occurring at the head of the canal(11). 55% of the 31 sediment samples taken from the Detroit River in 1982 were found to contain benzo(a)pyrene at concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 17.64 mg/kg(12). In 1992, benzo(a)pyrene was detected in bed sediments from the San Joaquin River at Vernalis and Patterson at concentrations of 1.6 and 0.4 ng/L, respectively; it was detected in the bed and suspended sediments from tributaries at the following concentrations, ng/L, respectively: 0.6, 3.2 Salt Slough; 1.0, 1.4, Orestimba Creek; 76, 110 Dry Creek; 13, Mokelumne River at Woodbridge; 13, the Turlock Irrigation District lateral 5, and 3.5 in suspended sediments in San Joaquin River at Patterson(13).",

Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in utility right-of-way ditch sediments at mean concentrations of, mg/kg wet weight: 67, at the base of utility poles; 0.11, 4 m upstream from a utility pole; 0.41, 0.1 to 0.3 m from a utility pole; and 0.64, 4 m downstream from a utility pole(1). Benzo(a)pyrene concentrations in nearshore coastal sediments offshore Matagorda, TX, near a multiwell platform averaged 9.4 ppb; in adjacent coastal estuaries the concentration averaged 5.3 ppb(2). Sediment samples collected from Santa Monica Bay and Palos Verdes Shelf, CA in Sept 1985 contained mean benzo(a)pyrene concentrations of, ng/g dry weight (depth, cm): in the Bay 9.2 (0 to 2) and 4.7 (4 to 8); and in the Shelf 70 (0 to 2), 99 (8 to 12), 228 (0 to 2), and 440 (8 to 12)(3). The concentration of benzo(a)pyrene in sediment cores taken from Arthur Kill, Hackensack River, and the Passaic River ranged from 0.31 to 11.0, 0.50 to 4.70, and 0.22 to 210 ng/kg, respectively(4). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in marine (Saguenay Fjord, Quebec, Canada) and freshwater (St. Louis River, Quebec) sediment samples at mean concentrations of 0.040 and 0.840 ug/g dry weight, respectively(5). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in Lake Erie sediments from one site in the western basin and another site just offshore of Cleveland, OH, at mean concentrations of 5.02 and 15.09 mg/kg, respectively; it was not detected in 5 other sites along the lake(6). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in sediments from Quincy Bay in Boston Harbor and in the Hudson River in New York Harbor, at mean concentrations of 3200 and 500 ng/g dry weight, respectively(7). Sediment samples collected from southern Lake Michigan in August 2011 contained a mean benzo(a)pyrene concentration of2.7 ng/g dry wt(8).",

Airborne particulate samples collected from the Upper Silesia region of Poland, in the winter of 1988-89 and the summer of 1989, were found to contain benzo(a)pyrene (number of times detected, concentration range in ng/cu m): winter (8, 8.7 to 42.3) and summer (8, 1.8 to 41.6)(4). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in air samples collected along Exhibition Road, London between 1/91 and 7/92 at concentrations ranging from <0.01 to 7.68 ng/cu m, average concentration 1.95 ng/cu m(5). Particulate matter collected from the air of La Plata, Argentina between 1983 and 1984, and 1985 and 1986 contained benzo(a)pyrene at concentrations ranging from, ng/cu m: 1.45 (June-September 1984); 0.25 (September-December 1984); 0.29 (January-April 1985); 2.27 (April-August 1985); 0.0 (August-December 1985); 0.09 (December 1985-January 1986); and 0.11 (March-June 1986)(6). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in ambient air samples collected from various areas in Stockholm from June 1980 to Dec 1983 at mean concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 ng/cu m(7). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in the particulate phase of air samples collected from Kosnica, Croatia in Feb and Aug of 1990 at mean concentrations of 3.93 and 1.6 ng/cu m, respectively(8). Winter and summer average concentrations for benzo(a)pyrene in Kosnica in the particulate phase were 2.1-5.5 ng/cu m, and 0.7-2.5 ng/cu m, respectively(8). Atmospheric samples collected at locations around Birmingham, UK in the winter and summer contained benzo(a)pyrene at a total concentration (particulate) of 0.81 (0.73) and 0.25 (0.23)ng/cu m, respectively; the total concentration (particulate) at a rural site in the summer was 0.06 (0.06) ng/cu m(9). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in air particulate matter from Augusta City, Italy during 10/1991 to 7/1992 at concentrations ranging from 1.14 in autumn to 6.75 ng/cu m in summer(10). Benzo(a)pyrene ranged in concentration from 0.037 to 0.55 ng/cu m, mean 0.21, in air samples collected in Aug to Sept 1989 from Brazzaville, Congo(11). The mean particulate phase benzo(a)pyrene concentration in urban Lahore, Pakistan was 9.32 ng/cu m(12). Air samples collected along a transect from the city of Stockholm to the open coastal area of the Baltic Sea contained benzo(a)pyrene at concentrations ranging from 0.14 to 0.44 ng/cu m(13). 24-hour samples of airborne particulates collected for one year starting in July 1987 in Thessaloniki, Greece, from one site at the city center, and another in the city industrial zone, detected benzo(a)pyrene at mean concentrations of 6.4 and 7.1 ng/cu m, respectively(14).",

Creosote/chlorphenols-treated wood utility poles and railway ties were found to contain benzo(a)pyrene at a concentration of 1,116 and 461 mg/kg wet weight, respectively(2). Concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene associated with particulates emitted from a spark-ignited engine and a diesel engine were 109 and 3 ug/g particulates, respectively(3). The mean concentration of benzo(a)pyrene in used lubricating oils from gasoline, M15, diesel and gas fueled vehicles was 22, 31, 0.8, and 13 ppm, respectively(4). Benzo(a)pyrene was identified in crankcase oil, fire soot and car soot at mean concentrations of 1.89, 1.37, and 1.99 ug/g(5). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in coal tar and carbon black at concentrations of 9.7 mg/g, and 250 ug/g, respectively(6). Benzo(a)pyrene was identified as a particulate organic emitted during the open burning of scrap rubber tires(7). Benzo(a)pyrene was detected in airborne particulate matter from the burning of wood and other vegetation (concentration in ug/g): Australian native wood (27.3); Australian native plants (26.2); cooking meat using Australian native plants as fuel (37.2); large-scale backyard burn of native Australian and introduced species and cardboard products (70.5); large-scale bush fire (194); leaves from Australian native vegetation (6.0); wood from Australian native vegetation (5.5); commercial incinerator burning paper and cardboard products (2.2)(8).",

Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzo(a)pyrene via inhalation of tobacco smoke and ambient air, inhalation of exhaust from cooking processes that produce smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with soil, road and house dust and other entities contaminated or containing benzo(a)pyrene(SRC). The general population can also be exposed to benzo[a]pyrene through pharmaceutical products based on coal tar that are applied to the skin(2). Sources in the diet include barbecued/grilled/broiled and smoke-cured meats; roasted, baked and fried foods (high-temperature processing); bread, cereals and grains (at least in part from gas/flame-drying of grains); and vegetables grown in contaminated soils, or in areas with surface contamination from atmospheric PAH fall-out(2).",

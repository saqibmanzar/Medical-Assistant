When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The IR spectra tells you what types of vibrational mode (motion) responses occur in a molecule interacting with infrared light.  It is used to help determine the functional groups in a molecule.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering suspensions of succinic anhydride (97% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for ... 2 yr. ...

Succinic anhydride was administered as a suspension in corn oil by gavage, 5 days/wk week for 103 wk. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2 yr studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of succinic anhydride for male or female F344/N rats given 50 or 100 mg/kg succinic anhydride. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice given 38 or 75 mg/kg succinic anhydride or for female B6C3F1 mice given 75 or 150 mg/kg.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.5X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates succinic anhydride will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase succinic anhydride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 70 days. If released to moist soil, the major fate of succinic anhydride is expected to be hydrolysis.  Succinic anhydride is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, succinic anhydride will rapidly hydrolyze; the half-life of succinic anhydride in water is 4.3 minutes at 25 \u00b0C. Bioconcentration of succinic anhydride in aquatic organisms is unlikely due to its rapid hydrolysis. Occupational exposure to succinic anhydride may occur through inhalation of vapors or dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where succinic anhydride is produced or used. No ambient monitoring data were found for succinic anhydride. Due to succinic anhydride's rapid hydrolysis, it is unlikely that the general population would be exposed to this chemical; however, succinic anhydride may exist as a vapor in dry air. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It is used as a solvent; intermediate in dye and resins industries; in manufacture of insecticides, waterproofing agents, niacin and niacinamide. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: 3-Methylpyridine caused eye irritation, gastro-intestinal disturbances and central nervous system (CNS) effects in one worker and may have produced liver abnormalities and facial skin eruptions in another. ANIMAL STUDIES: 3-Methylpyridine was a marked skin irritant in rabbits and guinea-pigs and has caused severe eye irritation in rabbits.. It has affected electrophysiological parameters in rats. Moderate acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity was demonstrated in laboratory animals, the principal site of toxic attack being the CNS.  Repeated inhalation exposure resulted in increased liver weight in rats. 3-Methylpyridine was tested in three independent bacterial gene mutation studies; all studies gave negative results in S. typhimurium or E. coli tester strains, with and without exogenous metabolic activation. In vivo, no significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were observed in peripheral blood of male or female mice. In NTP cancerogenicity studies there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3-methylpyridine in male mice based on increased incidences of alveolar/ bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3-methylpyridine in female mice based on the increased incidences of alveolar/ bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in the lung and of hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatoblastoma in the liver.  In the similar studies in rats there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3-methylpyridine in male rats. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3-methylpyridine  in female rats based on increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined).",

To determine which Maillard reaction products are important in the formation of IQ-type mutagens in boiled pork juice, six Maillard reaction products were separately added to the porkjuice before reflux boiling and then the mutagenicity of each sample was examined with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mix. The addition of four Maillard reaction products enhanced the mutagenicity of pork juice 1.2-2.9-fold after reflux boiling. The highest level of enhancement was observed with tetrahydrothiophene, followed by 2,3-dimethylpyrazine, 3-methylpyridine and 2-methylpyridine. However, the addition of 2-acetylpyrrole and imidazole greatly inhibited the mutagenicity of pork juice.",

Following either 7 or 14 days the rabbits were killed and histological examinations were conducted on the eyes. Eye irritation, caused by these exposures, was characterized by ocular irritation indice (OII). Eye irritation assessments showed that irritation was maximal either 1 hr or 1 day after exposure. Based upon ocular irritation indice values, 2-picoline, 3-picoline and pyridine were classified as \"irritating\", while 4-picoline was classified a \"severely irritating\". ... Over longer periods of time, which included recovery, all four of these compounds were determined to be \"severely irritating\". Histological examination of the eyes showed similar effects for all four compounds considered. These effects included keratitis lesions in corneal epithelial tissue, fibrillary edematous lamallae dissociation, and cellular inflammatory infiltration. Skin irritation was characterized by the cutaneous primary irritation index (PII). 2-Picoline, 3-picoline, and pyridine had primary irritation index values of 5.8, 6.8, and 4.8 respectively, while 4-picoline showed such high percutaneous toxicity that a primary irritation index value could not be determined. Overall results on skin irritation suggested that 2-picoline and 3-picoline should be classified as \"severely irritating\" with pyridine being classified as \"irritating\". Histological exam of the skin provided evidence for necrosis, ulceration, and regeneration. ...",

The tests contained measures of sensory function (paired pulse flash evoked potentials, pattern reversal evoked potentials, and brainstem auditory evoked rsponses) and cerebral excitability (pentylenetetrazol seizures and hippocampal after discharges). In general, rats treated with 2- and 3-methylpyridine were more affected than those treated with 4-methylpyridine. The changes observed were in many ways similar to those seen following administration of depressent compounds: increased latency of evoked potentials and increased latency to pentylenetetrazol seizures. ... Controls were treated with saline. The LD50s were 200 mg/kg for 2-methylpyridine, 150 mg/kg for 3-methylpyridine, and 162 mg/kg for 4-methylpyridine. Death occurred within 24 to 48 hours after treatment. All of the methylpyridines produced a mild hypothermia. 3-Methylpyridine and 2-methylpyridine affected electrophysiological parameters more than did 4-methylpyridine. /Results suggest/ that all three compounds produce dysfunctions that only vary in magnitude.",

Special study groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to the same concentrations for 23 days for determinations of cytochrome P450 enzyme activity. All rats survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of males and females exposed to 625 or 1,250 mg/L were significantly less than those of the controls. Water consumption by 625 and 1,250 mg/L males and females was less than that by the controls at weeks 1 and 13 due to poor palatability. On day 23, hepatic 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase activity was significantly increased in 312 mg/L or greater males and in 156 mg/L or greater females compared to that in the controls. Absolute liver weights of 625 and 1,250 mg/L males and absolute and relative liver weights of 625 and 1,250 mg/L females were significantly less than those of the controls. The Markov transition matrix analyses of estrous cyclicity indicated female rats in the 312 and 625 mg/L groups had a significantly higher probability of extended estrus than the control females, suggesting a potential for beta-picoline to be a reproductive toxicant in female rats exposed to these concentrations.  The severity of chronic progressive nephropathy was increased in 625 and 1,250 mg/L males and that of hyaline droplet accumulation in proximal renal tubules was increased in 1,250 mg/L males. The concentrations of renal a2u-globulin were significantly increased in 312 mg/L or greater males compared to the controls.",

Survival of all exposed groups was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of 1,250 mg/L males were 10% less than those of the control group after week 57, and those of 1,250 mg/L females were generally 10% less after week 13. Water consumption by exposed groups of males and females was similar to that by con-trols during the first 13 weeks of the study; water consumption by 625 and 1,250 mg/L males and 1,250 mg/L females was less than that in the controls after week 13.  In the liver of females, there were significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in the 312.5 mg/L group and hepatocellular carcinoma in all exposed groups. The combined incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma were significantly increased in all exposed females.  In the lung, the incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma in 625 mg/L males was significantly increased. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma occurred with a positive trend in females. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinoma were increased in all exposed groups of females. The incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) was significantly increased in 1,250 mg/L females. The incidence of alveolar epithelium hyperplasia was significantly increased in 1,250 mg/L females.  In the nose, there were significantly increased incidences of olfactory epithelium respiratory metaplasia in 625 mg/L males and 1,250 mg/L males and females; the incidence of olfactory epithelium atrophy was significantly increased in 1,250 mg/L females.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.05 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-methylpyridine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-methylpyridine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 days. 3-Methylpyridine does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-methylpyridine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 110. The pKa of 3-methylpyridine is 5.63, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Koc can vary with pH with lowest adsorption occurring in the non-ionized form. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.73X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 3-Methylpyridine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 3-Methylpyridine may biodegrade fairly rapidly under aerobic conditions in both soil and water. 3-Methylpyridine is expected to be resistant to biodegradation under some anaerobic conditions. If released into water, 3-methylpyridine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc value. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 37 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. In water, 3-methylpyridine was rapidly biodegraded in acclimated aerobic natural waters with complete removal within 2 to 4 days. In sulfidogenic estuarine sediments, however, 3-methylpyridine was not biodegraded over 200 days. Occupational exposure to 3-methylpyridine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-methylpyridine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 3-methylpyridine via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of cigarette smoke, and ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

The pKa of 3-methylpyridine is 5.63(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Soil studies with 2-methylpyridine(5), a compound expected to have similar sorption properties as 3-methylpryidine(SRC), demonstrated that Koc can vary with pH with lowest adsorption occurring in the non-ionized form(5). Volatilization of 3-methylpyridine from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 7.73X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(6). 2-Methylpyridine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 6.05 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(7). 3-Methylpyridine is expected to biodegrade fairly rapidly in aerobic soil; however, under anaerobic conditions, this compound may be persistent(8,9). 3-Methylpyridine was added to aerobic Fincastle silt loam for a period of 32 days; 69.3% of the available nitrogen was released after this time(8). However, in an aerobic surface soil experiment, only 35% biodegradation was reported in 3 months while in anaerobic surface soil, under denitrifying and sulfidogenic conditions, 50 and 10 to 20% of the initially added 3-methylpyridine was biodegraded, respectively, in 3 months(9).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.73X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 37 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.20(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Low bioconcentration was reported for BCF tests using carp (Cyprinus carpio)(7). Rapid biodegradation under aerobic conditions is likely although 3-methylpyridine seems resistant to biodegradation under anaerobic conditions(8,9). 3-Methylpyridine was rapidly biodegraded in acclimated aerobic natural waters with complete removal within 2 to 4 days(8). However, in sulfidogenic estuarine sediments, 3-methylpyridine was not biodegraded over 200 days(9). 3-Methylpyridine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). The UV absorption spectrum of 3-methylpyridine in aqueous solution shows no absorption >290 nm(10); therefore, 3-methylpyridine is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

For ground water that was taken from an aquifer contaminated by underground coal gasification, and to which soil was added as inocula, 3-methylpyridine degradation was also rapid(2). Over 99% of 3-methylpyridine at an initial average concentration of 32.4 ppm was lost within 10 days when samples were incubated aerobically at 20 \u00b0C(2). On the average, less than a 25% loss occurred within 31 days for sterilized, but otherwise, identical controls(2). For anoxic groundwater samples with oxygen levels less than 0.1 to 0.4 ppm and without soil added, 3-methylpyridine degradation was shown to be much slower(2). About 30% of the original average concentration of 24.8 ppm remained after 33 days(2). 3-Methylpyridine, present at 100 mg/L, reached 3% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(3).",

Nearly 50% of the initially added 3-methylpyridine was biodegraded in an unpolluted surface soil under denitrifying conditions(1). Under denitrifying conditions, the unpolluted surface soil transformed nearly 50% of the 3-methylpyridine(1). Under sulfate-reducing conditions, however, only 10 to 20% of the 3-methylpyridine was transformed in unpolluted surface soils(1). In polluted soil (soil contaminated with pyridine derivatives obtained from a chemical plant in Indianapolis, IN) both surface and subsurface soils transformed 3-methylpyridine with complete biodegradation within 2 weeks under aerobic conditions(1). Under sulfate-reducing conditions, 3-methylpyridine in the subsurface soil was completely biodegraded in 3 months whereas only 40% biodegradation in 3 months was observed for the surface soil under the same conditions(1). 3-Methylpyridine was not biodegraded under denitrifying conditions in the subsurface soil but was removed at a level of 60-65% over 3 months in the surface soil(1). 3-Methylpyridine was incubated in sulfidogenic estuarine sediments at concentrations from 70 to 80 uM; no biodegradation was reported over 200 days(2). In an anaerobic biodegradation study using sludge from a wastewater treatment plant digester as inoculum, 3-methylpyridine was found to have poor biodegradability(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

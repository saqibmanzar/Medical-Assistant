When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to the atmosphere, trichloroacetyl chloride will exist solely in the vapor-phase where it is expected that this compound will not degrade appreciably via hydroxyl radicals. A hydrolysis half-life of 455 years for trichloroacetyl chloride in the atmosphere has been estimated. Based on an estimated Koc of 72, trichloroacetyl chloride should be highly mobile in soil. Hydrolysis of trichloroacetyl chloride is, however, expected to be a major fate process for this compound and should preclude leaching processes in the environment. Data on the hydrolysis of trichloroacetyl chloride are not available; however, acetyl chloride at 25 \u00b0C has a half-life of 0.8 sec and dichloroacetyl chloride at -20 \u00b0C has a hydrolysis rate of 0.004/min. In water, trichloroacetyl chloride is expected to hydrolyze very quickly. Trichloroacetyl chloride is not expected to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms based on an estimated BCF value of 3. Exposure to trichloroacetyl chloride may occur occupationally during its production or during its use as a chemical intermediate. (SRC)",

A value of 455 years was calculated with a range from 130 to 1595 years(1). This suggests that gas phase hydrolysis is not an effective removal mechanism for this compound in the atmosphere. A study was made looking at \"rain-out\" where rain passing through an atmosphere containing the acid chloride vapor is viewed as a possible atmospheric removal mechanism. In this simplified model, an atmospheric half-life of 5 months was determined for an area which has an average yearly rainfall of 100 g/sq cm(2). Data on the hydrolysis of trichloroacetyl chloride are not available. Based on analogy to similar compounds, acetyl chloride at 25 \u00b0C has a half-life of 0.8 sec(2); dichloroacetyl chloride at -20 \u00b0C has a hydrolysis rate of 0.004/min(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of trichlorodiacetyl chloride with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated to be less than 1x10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4). This indicates that trichloroacetyl chloride is resistant to degradation via photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

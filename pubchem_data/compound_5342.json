Sulfinpyrazone also blocks tubular excretion of various acidic drugs, resulting in increased serum concentration of the drugs. In addition, sulfinpyrazone and its active metabolite inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane A2, by competitively inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase, thereby preventing platelet aggregation through restoration of platelet survival time to normal, and decreasing platelet adhesiveness to subendothelial cells.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Sulfinpyrazone competitively inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid at the proximal convoluted tubule, thereby facilitating urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing plasma urate concentrations.  This is likely done through inhibition of the urate anion transporter (hURAT1) as well as the human organic anion transporter 4 (hOAT4). Sulfinpyrazone is not intended for the treatment of acute attacks because it lacks therapeutically useful analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Sulfinpyrazone and its sulfide metabolite possess COX inhibitory effects. Sulfinpyrazone has also been shown to be a UDP-glucuronsyltransferase inhibitor and a very potent CYP2C9 inhibitor.  Sulfinpyrazone is also known to be a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibitor as well as an inhibitor of several multridrug resistance proteins (MRPs).",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Male volunteers were exposed at rest or while exercising. Exposure periods were 4 hr with a 10 min break between each hour of exposure. ... Retention, atmospheric clearance, and rate of uptake of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate decreased as exposure proceeded. Steady state values of these parameters were attained after 3 to 4 hr. The relative amounts of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate in the expired air decreased as uptake increased. Individual uptake of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate was mainly governed by pulmonary ventilation rate, cardiac output and anthropometric factors such as percent body fat. Retention increased with increasing ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate exposure concentration and increasing workload during exercise. The rate of uptake also increased with workload during exercise. This was attributed primarily to an increased pulmonary ventilation rate. Ethylene glycol monoethyl ether as well as ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate was detected in the expired air. Respiratory elimination of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether after exposure ended was biphasic. Respiratory elimination of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, however, was a minor route of excretion, only around 0.5% uptake being recovered in the expired air. Respiratory elimination of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate was significantly correlated only with total body uptake, body fat content, and pulmonary ventilation rate.",

Exposure to 50 ppm 2-propoxyethyl acetate and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate resulted in rapid absorption through the lungs. Breath concentrations of 2-propoxyethyl acetate and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate showed a rapid increase with the duration of the exposure and reached a plateau after 3 hours. After iv administration of 1 mg/kg radiolabeled 2-propoxyethyl acetate, dogs eliminated about 88% of the radioactivity in the urine within 24 hours; about 61% of an equivalent dose of 2-ethoxyethyl acetate was excreted in the urine within 24 hours. Blood radioactivity after 2-propoxyethyl acetate administration was cleared more rapidly than after 2-ethoxyethyl acetate. For each compound, the amounts absorbed were similar after 30 and 60 minute exposures. The in vitro percutaneous absorption lag times were 1.2 and 1.6 hours for 2-propoxyethyl acetate and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, respectively. Neither 2-ethoxyethyl acetate nor 2-propoxyethyl acetate altered the diffusion properties of the skin preparations. Although the excretion rates for 2-propoxyethyl acetate and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate are markedly different, the total amount of each compound absorbed through the skin and lungs is similar.",

Individuals were exposed to each concentration for periods of 4 hours. Unexposed periods between the experiments lasted 2 to 3 weeks. Maximal ethoxyacetic acid excretion took place 3 to 4 hours after exposure was discontinued; the half life for elimination was 23.6 hours. It was found that after physical exercise, a second maximum of excretion was observed approximately 3 hours after the first one. Approximately 22% of the absorbed ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate dose was recovered in the urine as ethoxyacetic acid after 42 hours.",

The mean combined exposure concentration of ethyl ether of ethylene glycol and ethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate (expressed in equivalent weight of ethyl ether of ethylene glycol was 14.0 mg/cu m with occasional slight excursions above the current Belgian occupational exposure limit. The daily combined exposures profiles for ethylene glycol ethyl ether and ethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate were rather constant during the first observation period, but they tended to decrease during the last week. The urinary ethoxyacetic acid excretion clearly increased during the work week. Over the weekends the elimination was far from complete, and even after a prolonged nonexposure period of 12 days traces of the metabolite were still detectable. Based on the observations from the first period, a good linear correlation was found between the average exposure over 5 days (914.4 mg/cu m) and the ethoxyacetic acid excretion of the end of the week (105.7 mg/g creatinine). An ethoxyacetic acid estimate of 150 + or - 35 mg/g was found to correspond with repeated 5 days full-shift exposures to the respective occupational exposure limit of ethylene glyol ethyl ether (19 mg/cu m) or ethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate (27 mg/cu m).",

The workers in the production plant (n= 12) were exposed to average concentrations of ethoxyethanol, ethoxyethyl acetate, butoxyethanol, 1-methoxypropanol-2, 2-methoxypropyl-1-acetate and xylene of 2.8; 2.7; 1.1; 7.0; 2.8 and 1.7 ppm. Internal exposure was estimated by measuring butoxyethanol in blood as well as ethoxyacetic acid and butoxyacetic acid in urine samples. As expected, the highest values were found in the varnish production. The average post shift concentrations of butoxyethanol, ethoxyacetic acid and butoxyacetic acid were 121.3 ug/L; 167.8 and 10.5 mg/L. The relatively high concentrations of ethoxyacetic acid and butoxyacetic acid in pre-shift samples can be explained by the long half-lives of these metabolites. Most of the glycol ethers were taken up through the skin. The authors think that a future tolerable limit value for the concentration of ethoxyacetic acid in urine should be in the order of 100 to 200 mg/L.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The methyl and ethyl ethers of ethylene glycol, ie 2- methoxyethanol (2-ME) esters, 2-methoxyethyl acetate (2-MEA) and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate (2- EEA) ... are all stable, and are all miscible with (or in the case of 2-EEA very soluble in) water and miscible with a large number of organic solvents. ... The solubility of these glycol ethers in water and their relatively low vapor pressure could result in their build-up in water in the absence of degradation. However, degradation by microorganisms in soil, sewage sludge, and water appears to prevent this possibility. Atmospheric emissions resulting from the use of glycol ethers as evaporative solvents result in the greatest environmental exposure....  Effects on Organisms in the Environment: The toxicity of 2-ME and 2-EE to microorganisms and aquatic animals appears to be low. ... The glycol ether acetates (2-MEA and 2-EEA) are far more toxic to fish. The LC50 of 2-EEA for fathead minnows is 46 mg/L and that of 2-MEA for tidewater silverfish and bluegills is 45 mg/L. ...  Effects on Experimental Animals and In Vitro Test Systems: Systemic toxicity: The toxicity of 2-ME and 2-EE to experimental animals has been much more widely studied than that of 2-MEA and 2-EEA. 2-ME and 2-EE and their acetates have similar lethalities after single exposures and they show low acute lethality whether exposure is via the dermal, oral, or inhalation route. Oral LD60 values for a variety of species range between 900 and 3400 mg/kg body weight for 2-ME, 1400 and 5500 mg/kg for 2-EE, 1250 and 3930 mg/kg for 2-MEA, and 1300 and 5100 mg/kg for 2-EEA. ... 2-EE was found to be teratogenic (in the presence of slight maternal toxicity). Another study reported fetotoxicity but no malformations in rats exposed to 184 or 920 mg 2-EE/cu m, and in rabbits exposed to 644 mg 2-EE/cu m. NOEL values for developmental effects were 37 mg/cu m for rats and 184 mg/cu m for rabbits. Behavioral and neurochemical alterations were seen in the offspring of rats exposed to 368 mg 2-EE/cu m on days 7-13 or 14-20 of gestation. Rats treated by dermal application of 0.25 mL undiluted 2-EE (four times daily on gestation days 7-16) exhibited marked fetotoxicity and a high incidence of malformation in the absence of maternal toxicity. Similar effects were noted following 2-EEA treatment of rats, using the same protocol, at an equimolar dose (0.35 mL, four times daily). Inhalation exposure of rabbits to 2-EEA on gestation days 6-18 produced teratogenic responses at 2176 mg/cu m and 544 mg/cu m in two different studies, the developmental NOEL values in these two studies being 135 mg/m3 and 270 mg/m3. Exposure of rats to 2-EEA on days 6-15 of gestation produced fetotoxicity at 540 mg/cu m and malformation at 1080 mg/cu m. The developmental NOEL was 170 mg/cu m. Effects on humans: Information on the toxic effects of these four glycol ethers on humans is limited. The results from the few case reports and workplace epidemiological studies are consistent with the adverse effects seen in experimental animals. No reports quantifying general population exposure and health effects have been found. ...",

It was part of a series of glycol ethers & congeners evaluated for structure-activity correlations using this design. Data collected on body weights, clinical signs, & food/water consumption during the dose-range-finding segment (Task 1) were used to set concns for the main study (Task 2) at 0.5%, 1.0%, & 2.0% EGEEA in drinking water. These concns produced calculated consumption estimates of nearly equal to 0.93, 1.86, & 3.0 g/kg/day. During Task 2, body weights were slightly reduced (<10%) only at the top dose, the same level at which water consumption was reduced by nearly equal to 20%. During Task 2, the mean number of litters/pair was reduced in the middle & high dose groups by 8% & 70%, respectively. The number of live pups/litter in these groups was reduced by 27% & 98%. In these two dose groups, the adjusted live pup weight also was reduced, by 5% & 13%, respectively. Thus, animals consuming 1% or 2% EGEEA delivered fewer, lighter pups in the presence of no or modest changes in body weight. The Task 3 crossover used control & 2% EGEEA mice, & found that the EGEEA-treated females produced fewer fertile matings, & these had 94% fewer pups, & only 7% of them were born alive. There were no effects seen with EGEEA-treated males. The control & 2% EGEEA F0 mice were killed & necropsied. There were no treatment-related changes in female body or organ weights, while treated males weighed 7% less than controls, & absolute testis weight was reduced by 9%. While there were no changes in sperm motility or density, the % abnormal forms doubled in the 2% EGEEA group at necropsy (from a control level of 3% abnormal forms). There were insufficient live pups from the 2% EGEEA group to provide pups for an evaluation of the second generation at that concn, so in Task 4, mice were evaluated from the control, 0.5% EGEEA-treated, & 1% EGEEA-treated groups. There was no indication of treatment-related reductions in growth to weaning, or in growth to mating at 74 +/- 10 days of age. At the mating trial, there was a 50% reduction in the number of pairs that were confirmed sperm positive in the 1% group, but no change in the fertility of those pairs, & no change in the pup indices as a result of those matings. After delivery of the F2's, all the mice were killed, & the F1's were necropsied. While there were no reductions in body weight, there was a 6% reduction in female relative liver weight at 1%. In males, liver weight was increased by 9% & 7% in the 0.5% & 1% EGEEA-treated groups, respectively, while epididymis weight was reduced by 9% in the 1% EGEEA group. Cauda epididymal sperm density was reduced by 30% at the top dose. In summary, EGEEA was a reproductive toxicant in F0 mice, based on the large reductions in pup number in treated females & increased abnormal sperm in males. It was also a reproductive toxicant in the F1's, reducing epididymis weight & sperm number. The effects in the second generation were seen in the presence of changes in liver weight.",

For determination of enzyme inhibition, groups of 3-5 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0 or 1 g triorthocresyl phosphate/kg bw, 15-18 hours prior to sacrifice, then nasal tissue was incubated with 76 mM EGEEAc; extent of hydrolysis of EGEEAc was determined by measuring ethylene glycol monoethyl ether levels in the supernatant by gas chromatography. The Vmax, Km, and Vmax/Km were 0.730, 9.52, and 0.77, respectively, indicating that mouse nasal carboxylesterase has significant affinity for EGEEAc. Pretreatment of mice with TOCP decreased nasal carboxylesterase activity to less than 26% of control values.

Biogenicly-produced non-terpenoid volatile organic compounds such as ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate are found in emissions from woody Mediterranean plants species. If released to the air, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on a vapor pressure of 2.00 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.7 days. Ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate is expected to have very high mobility in soil based on an estimated Koc of 32. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be a fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Several biodegradation screening tests have demonstrated that ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate is readily biodegradable; 80% biodegradation was measured for ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate in a 20 day screening test. If released into water, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an environmental fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 days and 100 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3.0 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. This compound is expected to hydrolyze with estimated half-lives of 305 and 30 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Volatilization of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process(SRC) given its Henry's Law constant of 3.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based on its vapor pressure of 2.00 mm Hg(5). Several screening biodegradation tests have demonstrated that ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate is readily biodegradable(6-9); 80% biodegradation was measured for ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate in a 20 day screening test(7) suggesting that biodegradation may be an important fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces may occur(1) based on a Henry's Law constant of 3.2X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(3). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(1), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 and 100 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4),an estimated BCF value of 3.0(SRC), determined from its log Kow(2), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate in a 28 day river die-away test resulted in classification as easily degraded(5) and 80% biodegradation occurred in a 20 day screening test(6) which suggest biodegradation as an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Levels of 27.0-166.5 mg/cu m were detected in workplace air samples from two auto paint shops in Spain(2). A survey of furniture factories in Finland detected ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate in 9% of all air samples with a mean concn of 7 ppm(3). The mean TWA concn at various job sites in the screen print industry has been reported to be 5-18.5 ppm(4). Nearly 40% of 7,705 samples (collected by the National Institute of Occupational Health in Norway) containing solvent vapors from various industries contained ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate at unreported concentrations(5). Ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate was measured in microelectronic fabrication clean rooms at concentrations from not detected to 0.064 ppm (detection limit = 0.004 ppm)(6).",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Alvania Grease-RA was also used. It appeared that three employees were suffering from contact dermatitis and were patch tested. Two were allergic to phenyl-alpha-naphthylamine (PAN) which was present in both greases at 1%. There was no cross reactivity demonstrated with other naphthylamines. Brief histories of the two workers were provided. One was a 58 yr old welder and the other was a 61 yr old roller assembly worker. Despite improved protection for each of these workers, they continue to be afflicted by eczema. One required regular moderately potent topical applications of a steroid to control the condition. Both were diagnosed as having developed allergic contact dermatitis from the FR and Alvania greases as a result of sensitization to PAN, and also aryl phosphate ester mix in the second case. The authors note that testing with the routinely available phenyl-beta-naphthylamine and di-beta-naphthyl-p-phenylenediamine is not an adequate screen for detecting PAN sensitivity. They emphasize the risk of extrapolating data from animal models.",

Case-studies on patients with contact dermatitis, potentially associated with occupational exposure to N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine in greases or oils, have been identified. The majority of these patients also had a positive reaction to other substances in the test series, such as mercaptobenzothiazole or p-phenylenediamine. Lower incidences were reported in patients with past exposure to rubber materials. Because of the chemical's incorporation into the polymer matrix, exposure to N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine in rubber materials is assumed to be lower than exposure from greases or oils.",

Between 1954 and 1957, a special anticorrosive oil, which contained 0.5% N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine in addition to other chemicals, had been used in this unit. In 12 of 78 women in this unit (group A: 78 women/20 men), cancers were diagnosed between 1964 and 1973 in several organs (predominantly the uterus and ovary). The staff performing the actual packaging, and thus in contact with the oil, were mainly women. Morbidity and mortality from cancer were 3.1- and 3.5-fold higher, respectively, than expected, based upon age-specific and sex-specific data from the Swedish Cancer Register (the standard cancer rates for the period 1974-1976 were estimated on the basis of the 1973 rate). In the males of group A, no significant differences were established. In another unit (reference group B: 25 women/8 men) where anticorrosive oil without N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine had been used, morbidity and mortality from cancer were not elevated. This was also true for reference group C (8 women/23 men), from units that had been in contact with N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine-containing anticorrosive oil for a short period of time only, because they had demonstrated allergic reactions. The authors concluded that, apart from exposure to N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine, the formation of N-nitroso-N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine from sodium nitrite originating from the packaging paper used may be a possible explanation for the increased frequency of cancer in group A.",

In mice, a slightly increased methemoglobin level (4.1% vs 0.4% in controls) was noted within 10 min of a single ip administration; the increase was still detectable up to 24 hr later. Mice are less sensitive than humans to methemoglobin induction, and this small increase in methemoglobin level may be of importance to human health.",

If released into the atmosphere, N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine is expected to exist in both the particulate and vapor phases in the ambient atmosphere based on an extrapolated vapor pressure of 1.13X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxy radicals with an estimated half-life of about 1 hour. Particulate phase N-phenyl-1-naphthalenamine will be physically removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, an estimated Koc of 4,600 indicates that N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine is expected to have slight mobility in soil. Volitilization from dry and wet soil is not expected to occur based on this compound's extrapolated vapor pressure and an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-7 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C. The pKa of N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine is 4.93 at 25 \u00b0C indicating that this compound will partially exist in the cation form in the environment. Since N-phenyl-1-napthylamine exists in the protonated form, it will adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than its neutral counterparts. Biodegredation in soil is slow as suggested by CO2% evolution rates of 7 and 17% after 2 and 11 days, respectively. If released into water, N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation in water is moderate as indicated by a theoretical BOD in freshwater of 50% after 10 days. Photochemical degradation half-lives for N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine in water of 8.4 and 5.7 minutes have been reported. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF range of 427 to 2,730 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high, provided the compound is not altered physically or chemically once released into the environment. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine via ingestion of contaminated water. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 hr(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.5X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Based on its uv adsorption spectrum, direct photolysis of this compound is expected(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Visible epiretinal membranes were peeled but the normal appearing internal limiting membrane was not routinely stripped. Outcome measures included final Snellen visual acuity, rate of macular hole closure, complications, and number of supplemental procedures performed. RESULTS: Closed at one month, were 110 of 121 (91%) macular holes, including two that underwent repeat fluid/gas exchange and laser within the first two weeks after surgery. At the time of final follow-up (mean: 10.9 months), 110 of 121 (91%) macular holes were closed. This included 8 of 9 eyes that had reopening of the macular hole between one and 21 months successfully treated by repeat fluid-gas exchange and 2 eyes that underwent a second successful pars plana vitrectomy, membrane peeling, and repeat fluid-gas exchange. Overall, 98 of 121 eyes overall (81%) were successfully treated by a single surgery; 94 of 121 (78%) achieved two lines or greater of visual improvement; 83 of 121 (69%) achieved 20/70 or better vision; and 47 eyes (39%) achieved 20/40 or better vision. ... CONCLUSION: A combination of intravitreal perfluorocarbon gas and autologous plasma-thrombin mixture (tissue glue) was well tolerated in most patients and did not result in any specific long-term complications. The use of supplemental fluid-gas exchange when necessary improved the final success rate...",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Perfluoroethane is studied for its possible value as intravitreal tamponades in retinal surgery. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Perfluoroethane did not induce structural or numerical chromosome aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in either the non-activated or metabolically -activated test systems. The major complications in patients after vitreous surgery and one of two perfluorocarbon gases were increased intraocular pressure, which was usually transient, and gas-induced lens opacities. ANIMAL STUDIES: Acute exposure of rats to the test substance at concentrations of 20% by volume in air for 2 hours or 80% by volume in oxygen for 4 hours was not lethal and produced marginal signs of intoxication either during or after exposure or on gross pathological examination 14 days later. It did not show cardiac sensitization in beagle dogs at exposure levels of 200,000 ppm. 14-Day rat study including examination of FOB (Functional Observational Battery) and motor activity end-points, identifies a NOAEL of 50,000 ppm established based on the absence of effects in all end-points at the highest concentration tested. Perfluoroethane was not toxic in developmental studies in rats. Micronucleus evaluation from repeated inhalation exposure of male and female rats to 0, 2500, 10000, or 50000 ppm was negative.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

Seven days after injection, the experimental eyes in group A and C received 0.5 mL of C(2)F(6) injection. The ocular and retinal signs were examined for 8 following weeks and then killed for histological examination. Five eyes in group A (100.0%) showed complete separation of the vitreous cortex from the retina (PVD), three eyes in group B (60.0%) showed partial PVD, and no PVD was detected in group C and all control eyes. On electroretinogram no significant difference was found in amplitude and latency of a-(or b-) wave in both experimental and control eyes, between before and after experiments. No evidence of ocular or retinal toxicity was revealed by light or scanning electronic microscopy in all eyes. Vitreous injection of hyaluronidase combined with perfluoroethane, as a safety method, can induce posterior vitreous detachment without mechanical vitrectomy.",

Numerical aberrations were also recorded. To establish a concentration range for the chromosome aberration assay, a preliminary toxicity test was initially conducted. The test substance was provided as a colorless gas and diluted with ambient air in Tedlar bags to desired concentrations. HPBL were exposed to the pre-formulated test substance atmosphere concentrations in air-tight glass tubes. In the preliminary toxicity assay the cells were treated for 4 and 22 hours in the non-activated test condition and for 4 hours in the S9-activated test condition. All cells were harvested 22 hours after treatment initiation. The cells were exposed to 7 concentrations of the test substance ranging from 1.25 to 75% v/v, as well as a negative control (ambient air). Neither precipitation nor toxicity was observed in the preliminary toxicity assays in each test condition, therefore the highest concentration selected for the chromosome aberration assay was based on the highest achievable test substance concentration, 100%. The concentrations chosen for the chromosome aberration assay were 25, 50, 75 and 100%. No precipitation or toxicity was observed in any test condition. Selection of doses for microscopic analysis was based on the highest concentration tested. Cytogenetic evaluations were conducted at 25, 50, and 100% as well as the negative and positive control in each test condition. The percentage of cells with numerical or structural aberrations in the test substance-treated groups was not significantly increased above that of the negative control at any concentration (p = 0.05, Fisher's exact test). Under the conditions of this study, the test substance was not found to induce structural or numerical chromosome aberrations in the in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in either the non-activated or S9-activated test systems. It was concluded that the test substance was negative in this in vitro test."

The retinas of 31 patients (55.4%) were attached at six months after the disappearance of the gas. In many instances, operations performed with air-sulfur hexafluoride mixtures had failed and the retina was subsequently reattached with the use of the perfluorocarbon gases.

Eyes in group A and B received two vitreous injections of 15 IU of hyaluronidase at an interval of 5 days. The eyes in group C and all control eyes were injected with balanced salt solution (BSS). Seven days after injection, the experimental eyes in group A and C received 0.5 mL of C(2)F(6) injection. The ocular and retinal signs were examined for 8 following weeks and then killed for histological examination. Five eyes in group A (100.0%) showed complete separation of the vitreous cortex from the retina (PVD), three eyes in group B (60.0%) showed partial PVD, and no PVD was detected in group C and all control eyes. On electroretinogram no significant difference was found in amplitude and latency of a-(or b-) wave in both experimental and control eyes, between before and after experiments. No evidence of ocular or retinal toxicity was revealed by light or scanning electronic microscopy in all eyes.

Its formation as a byproduct in aluminum ore processes will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 25,100 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates perfluoroethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase perfluoroethane has an estimated atmospheric life-time of 500 to 10,000 years. Perfluoroethane has 20-, 100- and 500-year Global Warming Potentials of 8200, 9200-12,500 and 17,300-19,100, respectively. Perfluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, Perfluoroethane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 20.3 atm-cu m/mole. Perfluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, perfluoroethane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 10 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to perfluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where perfluoroethane is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may have limited exposure to perfluoroethane via medical procedures. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Barrow, AK were 2.80 and 2.99 parts/trillion volume in 1996 and 1997, respectively.

Annual average concentrations reported for Palmer Station, Antarctic were 2.49, 2.64, 2.64, and 2.75 parts/trillion volume for 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. The ever increasing concentrations are attributed mainly to aluminum manufacturing and electronic chip production. The background concentration is zero based on measurements reported over the last 100 years(1). The vertical distribution of perfluoroethane in the stratosphere was reported to range from 4 parts/trillion volume at 10 km to 2.5 parts/trillion volume at 33.2 km(2). Firn air samples collected at the North Greenland ice core project site in Greenland and from Berkner Island, Antarctica indicate that perfluoroethane increased from 0.3 to 2.9 parts/trillion between 1940 and 2003(3).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Sperm are acid-sensitive, so to assure fertility, semen provides a powerful alkalinizing action that abolishes the protective acidity of the vagina for several hours after intercourse.  This alkalinizing action of semen also enables acid-sensitive sexually transmitted diseases (STD) pathogens to transmit infection.  By blocking this action of semen, BufferGel prevents unwanted pregnancy, and shows promise for prevention of STDs, including HIV/AIDS."

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Urinary excretion of benzanthrone during 96 hours was higher in guinea pigs (28%) compared with rats and mice (19%). However, fecal elimination during 96 hours was higher in rats (39%) and mice (42%) than in guinea pigs (25%). Urinary elimination of benzanthrone in rats and mice was highest between 12 and 24 hours. The maximum amount of radiolabelled benzanthrone was eliminated through feces at 24-48 hours in all the three animal species. The retention of (14)C benzanthrone in the liver was comparable in rats (11.2%) and mice (11.9%), while in guinea pigs it was substantially higher (21.9%). The testes of rats and mice were devoid of radioactivity, whereas those of guinea pigs showed a marginal retention (1.25%) of (14)C. The present study suggests that guinea pigs are more prone to benzanthrone toxicity than are rats and mice since the bioelimination of this compound is slower and its organ retention is higher in this species.",

Male Wistar albino rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of benzanthrone oat 40 mg/kg daily for 3 consecutive days. The animals were killed 24 hours after the last treatment. Livers were removed for the preparation of subcellular fractions. Hepatic homogenate and subcellular fractions from control and treated rats were assayed for lipid peroxidation by determining the formation of malonaldehyde. The subcellular fractions included cell debris, nucleus, mitochondria, microsome, and cytosol. Protein content was determined as well. Benzanthrone caused statistically significant enhancements in NADPH dependent enzymatic and nonenzymatic hepatic lipid peroxidation in whole homogenate, nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions. Benzanthrone induced a significant increase of 212 and 68% in the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions, respectively. A significant increase of 116, 91, and 67% in whole homogenate, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions was induced by benzanthrone on prooxidant free nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation. Benzanthrone significantly enhanced prooxidant free FeSO4/ADP and ascorbate mediated nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation in hepatic in Fe(+2)/ADP and ascorbate dependent lipid peroxidation was also evident in the nuclear fraction. Increased production of lipid peroxides in nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions suggested that these membranes were the vulnerable sites for benzanthrone induced toxicity.",

With a Koc of 9.8X10+3, benzanthrone is not expected to migrate in soils, but is expected to sorb to sediments. Bioaccumulation may also be important because of the BCF value of 181; benzanthrone has been detected in fish. Benzanthrone will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere; although the majority will be particle-bound. When present in the atmosphere, benzanthrone will be subject to oxidation by hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of 21 hours. Particulate-phase benzanthrone may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. Exposure to benzanthrone can occur through dermal contact, inhalation, and ingestion. (SRC)",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Benzanthrone was also found on particulate matter (less than 2.1 um) in the ambient air in the Los Angeles area(2). Samples were taken over a 24-hour period at 6-day intervals during 1982. The results showed the following: West Los Angeles (0.62 ng per cu m), downtown (0.81 ng per cu m), Pasadena (0.84 ng per cu m), Rubidom (0.24 ng per cu m). Extracts of particulate samples collected by the National Air Sampling Network January-June 1966 from 50 cities in 45 states and the District of Columbia showed a concentration range of 0.9-13 ng per cu m(3). Samples of air borne particulates taken at 5 locations in Toronto, Ontario, Canada during 1972 and 1973 showed an average summer concentration of 30.5 ug per g particulate and winter concentration of 39.1 ug per g particulate(4). In Duisburg, Germany, particulate samples collected from ambient air in February-April 1982 contained 0.46-3.66 ng per cu m(5). Particulate samples collected in Barcelona, Spain during spring (March 16-22, 1989), summer (June 27-July 7, 1989), fall (November 6-13, 1989), and winter (February 5-12, 1990) showed concentrations of 15, 722, 282, and 30 pg per cu m, respectively(6). The pattern of higher concentrations during the summer and fall was not seen with most other polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) or PAH ketones detected in this study; these molecules generally showed higher concentrations in winter. Benzanthrone was also detected but not quantified in the air over Elverum, Norway(7).",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

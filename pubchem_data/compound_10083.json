Experimentation with the drug and its derivatives for recreational purposes has led to many cases of acute toxicity and has been linked to three fatalities. The social and in particular acute clinical harms of pipradrol derivatives have led to their control under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in the UK in 2012.  Interestingly, this drug has been studied for bactericidal properties, however, is not currently, used for this purpose. In addition to this, it has shown favorable effects in postpartum depressive symptoms.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Only a few patient but no physician measures indicated any superiority for pipradrol over placebo in the 80 patients who completed the study, and this occurred only in those patients who were initially more depressed. Pipradrol caused significantly more side effects, particularly stimulatory and autonomic effects, and was associated with significantly more anorexic effects and weight loss than placebo. Present results thus suggest at the most only limited efficacy for pipradrol in the treatment of depressed outpatients.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

In a pharmacokinetic study, it was shown that pipradrol conditioned place preference (CPP) was blocked by selective D1 dopamine antagonist, implicating that a rewarding effect of pipradrol may involve the activation of D1 dopamine receptors.  Pipradrol has a definite cerebral stimulating effect without affecting the blood pressure or respiration and has been used to counteract post-anaesthetic and chlorpromazine depression in man. Structurally related to phenylmethylamphetamine, a potent stimulant with a long half-life, pipradrol differs from amphetamine in that its action is more intense at higher centers, it does not exhibit pressor activity, there is no post-excitement depression, and this drug does not decrease appetite, as occurs with amphetamine.",

This drug effect was significantly reduced by pretreatment with chlorpromazine, phenoxybenzamine, intravenous BE-2254 or intracerebroventricular BE-2254. In animals pretreated with cyproheptadine or atropine, the hyperthermic effect was significantly potentiated. However, haloperidol, pimozide, diphenhydramine and pentobarbital failed to appreciably influence the drug response. These findings suggest that pipradrol-induced hyperthermia in the rabbit involves activation of central alpha-adrenergic receptors and is apparently enhanced by blockade of serotonergic or cholinergic receptors.",

This drug effect was significantly reduced by pretreatment with chlorpromazine, phenoxybenzamine, intravenous BE-2254 or intracerebroventricular BE-2254. In animals pretreated with cyproheptadine or atropine, the hyperthermic effect was significantly potentiated. However, haloperidol, pimozide, diphenhydramine and pentobarbital failed to appreciably influence the drug response. These findings suggest that pipradrol-induced hyperthermia in the rabbit involves activation of central alpha-adrenergic receptors and is apparently enhanced by blockade of serotonergic or cholinergic receptors",

The lowered concentration of high-energy-phosphates was due to a deficiency of their resynthesis because of disturbance of the coupling of oxidative phosphorylation and of the integrity of the mitochondrial membranes. Administration of pipradrol to the rats before swimming led to more severe disturbances of oxidative brain metabolism, reduced the generation of high-energy phosphates, and thus evidently lead to exhaustion of the energy reserves of the brain.",

This drug effect was significantly reduced by pretreatment with chlorpromazine, phenoxybenzamine, intravenous BE-2254 or intracerebroventricular BE-2254. In animals pretreated with cyproheptadine or atropine, the hyperthermic effect was significantly potentiated. However, haloperidol, pimozide, diphenhydramine and pentobarbital failed to appreciably influence the drug response. These findings suggest that pipradrol-induced hyperthermia in the rabbit involves activation of central alpha-adrenergic receptors and is apparently enhanced by blockade of serotonergic or cholinergic receptors",

Thus, for example, drug-induced enhancement of the reward value of stimulation should be reflected in a selective reduction of the latency to initiate stimulation (the ON latency), as compared with the latency to terminate stimulation (the OFF latency). The effects of the psychostimulant drugs, d-amphetamine and pipradrol, and the antidepressant, bupropion, were evaluated in this procedure as well as in a bar-pressing test of self-stimulation. Pipradrol (3 and 10 mg/kg) and bupropion (54 mg/kg) reduced ON latencies by 40% or more but failed to shorten OFF latencies, indicating that performance variables were not involved in the ON latency decrements. Although d-amphetamine (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) shortened ON latencies, the 1.0 mg/kg dose also reduced OFF latencies. Drug doses that reduced ON latencies also increased bar-pressing self-stimulation. The shuttlebox self-stimulation test appears to be capable of discriminating drug-induced enhancement in brain stimulation reward from performance variables.",

Rats were trained to discriminate between two stimuli (S+ and S-) to obtain /intracranial stimulation (ICS)/ in the lateral hypothalamus by pushing a panel in the presence of S+. In a subsequent preference test, ICS was no longer available, but responding on one of two novel levers now produced S+, whereas responding on the other lever produced S-. Four groups of four rats received 0, 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg pipradrol. Doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg significantly enhanced the preference for S+ over S-. These doses increased responding for S+, but had no effect on responding for S-.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.1X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pipradrol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pipradrol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.75 hours. Particulate-phase pipradrol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Pipradrol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pipradrol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 9000. The estimated pKa of pipradrol is 9.95, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Pipradrol may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, pipradrol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The estimated pKa indicates pipradrol will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 87 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to pipradrol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pipradrol is produced or used. Limited general population exposure to pipradrol will be through illegal use of the drug. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase pipradrol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.75 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.7X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase pipradrol may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

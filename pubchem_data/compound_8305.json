It is calculated as the sum of the mass of each constituent atom multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula.  The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Tetradifon is found on List B. Case No: 2655; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): 4-Chlorophenyl 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl sulfone; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

Management of seizures in both children and adults is with Valium or phenobarbital. Respiratory depression and even respiratory arrest, especially with concomitant use of Valium and phenobarbital in children, may occur. These drugs preferably should be used only in critical care areas where emergency endotracheal intubation can be performed. /It is recommended/ that epinephrine not be utilized in patients with organochlorine poisoning, as the organochlorines induce myocardial irritability and ventricular arrhythmias may occur. However, dopamine may be necessary in the event of hypotension unresponsive to fluid administration, and epinephrine may be necessary in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest. /Organochlorine insecticides/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.40X10-10 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates tetradifon will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase tetradifon will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Tetradifon is stable in sunlight. If released to soil, tetradifon is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 7,700. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.44X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Tetradifon is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Based on one soil persistence study and one anaerobic study, biodegradation should be a slow process in soil. If released into water, tetradifon is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Based on a persistence study in soil, biodegradation of tetradifon in water may not be an important fate process. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 1,900 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to tetradifon in the past may have occurred through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tetradifon was produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may have been exposed to tetradifon ingestion of food and drinking water, and via inhalation of ambient air in the vicinity of spray operations. Current occupational and general population exposures in the United States are expected to be low or non-existent since tetradifon is no longer produced or used in the US(SRC). The compound is manufactured in Spain. (SRC)",

Volatilization of tetradifon from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant estimated as 1.44X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 2.40X10-10 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 7.80X10-2 mg/L(2). Tetradifon is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(2). One persistence study indicated that 81% of tetradifon applied to an orchard with loamy soil (3.1% organic content, pH 7.4 and 26% clay) persisted for a minimum of 6 months; post application time was not given and samples were collected in the summer of 1967 and tested in 1968(4). Tetradifon did not persist in silty clay (4.9% organic content, pH 7.4 and 42% clay) approximately 2 yrs postapplication(4). Incubation of tetradifon with inocula of rumina bacteria or ciliated protozoa under anaerobic conditions suggests that tetradifon is not nutritionally used for growth of the organism and that this compound does not stimulate endogenous gas production(5).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Potential respiratory exposure of workers to tetradifon during airblast spraying of fruit orchards has been determined to be 0.07 mg/hr(1). In pesticide formulating plants, the most hazardous exposure of pesticides, such as tetradifon, may have been from spillage; furthermore, there was a high potential for exposure at mixing and bagging stations(1). Crop workers may have been unintentionally exposed to tetradifon during application; however, their main exposure resulted from contact with treated foliage or with pesticide or pesticide-contaminated material made airborne through agitation of foliage during work activity(1). Incidental to treating a crop, some pesticides, such as tetradifon, may have drifted onto workers in neighboring fields or in nearby suburban areas without there being any intent to treat those areas(1). Dusts tend to remain suspended longer than sprays, sometimes resulting in a cloud carried for a considerable distance from the point of release from an airplane(1). Therefore, exposure of the general population to tetradifon may have occurred through ingestion of contaminated foods(2,3) as well as from inhalation of dust and dermal contact resulting from spraying nearby fruit orchards(1).",

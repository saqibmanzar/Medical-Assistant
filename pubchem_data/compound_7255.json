When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

With the exception of the spleen, brain, and liver, a two-phased elimination was differentiated whereby the first phase was fast and the second one was slow. The half lives of the fast phase were equal for all tissues except muscle (6.85 hr) and ranged between 1.52 and 3.96 hr. The half-lives of the slower phase showed a different pattern, being shortest (14.55 hr) in the intestine and longest (326 hr) in the adipose tissue. Covalent binding of 3-chloro-p-toluidine or its metabolites to proteins was ascertained in the liver, kidney, lung, and erythrocytes. The subcellular distribution of the radioactivity corresponded to the protein composition of the individual fractions. Of these fractions, the soluble liver and kidney cell fraction exhibited the highest absolute and specific activity (activity per mg protein). The extent of the covalent binding does not correlate with the tissue half-life nor with the pathological tissue findings. The covalent binding in erythrocytes could be an indication of a reactive methemoglobin-forming metabolite. /3-Chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride/",

Direct measurement of radioactivity as well as measurement following combustion was accomplished using a liquid scintillation counter. Elimination from most tissues followed a two-compartment model, with very rapid elimination occurring between time 0 and 4 hr and a much slower elimination phase occurring after that. The average half-life of elimination for the initial phase in most tissues examined was 0.16 hr for juncos and 0.62 hr for blackbirds. The average for the slower second phase of elimination was 3.4 hr for juncos and 5.4 hr for blackbirds.

The steady-state concentrations in the bluegill tissues were reached by day 7 of exposure to the radiolabeled compound, with mean concentrations in the edible, nonedible, and whole-body tissues determined to be 2.9, 12.0, and 7.5 ug/g of tissue, respectively. Bioconcentration factors of 33x, 150x, and 88x were calculated for the three types of tissues. About 64% of the accumulated radiolabeled CPTH and metabolites were eliminated from the fish on day 28 of depuration. The distribution of radioactivity was found to be similar in all tissue groups. One metabolite was confirmed as N-acetyl-3-chloro-p-toluidine, with two metabolites suggested to be 4-acetamido-2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-amino-2-chlorobenzoic acid. The N-acetylated breakdown product has been previously reported to occur in both mammals and birds; thus, the metabolism of CPTH in fish may parallel that observed in these other species. /3-Chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride/",

The restricted use classification is necessary to address the potential for harm to applicators and because products are applied to various baits and placed in a variety of areas where exposure to endangered or other non-target species could occur. A ready-to-use 0.1% formulation, which is used in unoccupied cattle and poultry feeding structures, is the only remaining end-use product currently classified for general use.

The GC_MS method, which utilized deuterated CPTH as a surrogate, quantified CPTH residues in the breast tissue and gastrointestinal tract of CPTH-exposed birds.

The effects increased in severity with the increase of the dose. They appeared fairly rapidly (15 to 30 min), and they lasted for one or several hours, depending on the dose. When the dose was lethal, the symptoms lasted until death. After recovery, the animal resumed its normal activities without any delayed symptoms. In the rabbit, sometimes anuria was observed, which at the autopsy was found to be due to a mechanical obstruction of the urinary meatus (a hemorrhagic irritation and thickening of the urinary bladder wall was observed which may cause urinary retention and distension of the bladder). Sometimes the anuria was due probably to atony of the bladder also. No lesions could be detected histopatholgically on the kidneys in rats or rabbits. /3-Chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride/",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.04 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-chloro-p-toluidine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-chloro-p-toluidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.2 hours. 3-Chloro-p-toluidine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-chloro-p-toluidine is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 180. However, primary aromatic amines can react with humic matter in soil forming an irreversible complex and as a result may be immobilized in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 3-Chloro-p-toluidine applied at 35 ug/g to a sandy loam soil exhibited a half-life of 26 hours and was mineralized, suggesting that biodegradation in soil may occur. If released into water, 3-chloro-p-toluidine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. 3-Chloro-p-toluidine was biodegraded in Elbe River bed sediment at 20 \u00b0C at a rate of 0.47/hr with a calculated half-life of 1.5 hrs, suggesting biodegradation may occur in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 22 and 160 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 15 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 3-chloro-p-toluidine may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-chloro-p-toluidine or its hydrochloride salt is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 22 and 160 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 15(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.27(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 3-Chloro-p-toluidine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). 3-Chloro-p-toluidine was biodegraded in Elbe River bed sediment at 20 \u00b0C at a rate of 0.47/hr with a calculated half-life of 1.5 hrs(8), suggesting biodegradation may occur in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that 3-chloro-p-toluidine is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. However, primary aromatic amines can react with humic matter in soil forming an irreversible complex and as a result may be immobilized in soil(3-4). With the increase of humic matter in soil, the tendency towards irreversible complex formation may increase and 3-chloro-p-toluidine may become increasingly immobilized(4). In sandy soil containing marginal amounts of humic matter, 3-chloro-p-toluidine may be mobile(5).",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

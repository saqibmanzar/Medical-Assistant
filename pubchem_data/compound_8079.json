For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Explosive limits specify the concentration range of a material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an ignition source.

The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Peroxide formation can be initiated by exposure to air, self-polymerization, or solvent impurities. Once formed, organic peroxides are sensitive to thermal or mechanical shock and can be violently explosive in concentrated solutions or as solids.",

No significant changes of body weight, food consumption and hematological findings for both sexes and urinalysis findings for males were detected. Blood chemical examination showed a decrease in triglyceride in males at 150 and 500 mg/kg bw/day, and increases in total bilirubin in males at 500 mg/kg bw/day and in total bile acid in females at 50 mg/kg bw/day and in both sexed at 150 mg/kg bw/day and above. In males of the 500 mg/kg bw/day group, there was an increase in relative kidney weight. On histopathological examinations, no dose-related changes were observed. The increase in total bile acid observed in females at 50 mg/kg bw/day was not considered to be an adverse effect because of no accompanying changes.

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 89 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cyclohexene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase cyclohexene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone, and nighttime nitrate radicals. The half-lives for these reactions in air are 6, 2, and 4 hours, respectively. Cyclohexene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.  If released to soil, cyclohexene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 850. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.55X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Cyclohexene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its extrapolated vapor pressure. A 0% theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum and the Japanese MITI test, suggests that biodegradation is not a fast process. If released into water, cyclohexene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 4 days, respectively. BCF values ranging from 23-45 measured in fish, suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Cyclohexene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to cyclohexene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyclohexene is produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase cyclohexene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone, and nitrate radicals(SRC). The half-life for the reaction with hydroxyl radicals is estimated to be 6 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.77X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec(3). The half-life for the reaction with ozone is estimated to be 2 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.04X10-16 cu-cm/molec-sec(4).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of cyclohexene with ozone has been measured as 2.04X10-16 cu-cm/molec-sec at 21 \u00b0C(2). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 molec/cu-cm(2). An experimental rate constant of 1.9X10-12 cu-cm/molec-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3) has been measured for the gas-phase reaction of cyclohexene with nighttime nitrate radicals. This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 4 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 2X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(4). Cyclohexene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(5). Cyclohexene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(5). Products from the reaction of cyclohexene with ozone are adipaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, pentanal, formic acid, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, 6-oxohexanoic acid, adipic acid, 5-oxopentanoic acid, and glutaric acid(6-8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

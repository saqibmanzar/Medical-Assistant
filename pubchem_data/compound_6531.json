Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The high and low time-weighted average concentrations were, respectively, 180 and 90 ppm for male rats and 90 and 45 ppm for female rats. The high and low time-weighted average concentrations for male mice were 567 and 284 ppm, respectively, and for female mice were 935 and 467 ppm, respectively. After a 78-week period of chemical administration, observation of the rats continued for an additional 33 weeks and the mice were observed for an additional 12 to 13 weeks. For rats, 50 animals of each sex were placed on test as controls and fed only the basal diet, while for mice, 20 animals of each sex served as controls. ... Under the conditions of this bioassay, dietary administration of dioxathion was not carcinogenic in Osborne-Mendel rats or B6C3F1 mice.

In the past, dioxathion may have been released to the environment during these uses as well as from its production, disposal of solutions for dipping livestock, and cleaning equipment used to formulate and apply the insecticide. If released in soil, dioxathion will degrade with a half-life ranging from 15 to 55 days in different soil types with dissipation being more rapid in drier, sandy soils. If released into water, dioxathion would adsorb moderately to sediment and particulate matter in the water column. Moderate bioconcentration in aquatic organisms would also be anticipated. Otherwise its fate in water is unknown. Dioxathion would probably be released into the atmosphere in the form of an aerosol and be subject to gravitational settling. Otherwise its fate in the atmosphere is unknown. People may be exposed to dioxathion from ingesting food that contains residues of the pesticide. Occupational exposure to dioxathion would be by inhalation and dermal contact. (SRC)",

In all but the fine sandy soil, the reaction was 1st order. Soil moisture was 40% of capacity, the temperature was 30 \u00b0C, the samples were covered, and illuminated with fluorescent light. Dissipation was more rapid from the drier, sandy soils. The mechanism responsible for dioxathion's removal is not clear, but a catalytic hydrolysis process appears to be most consistent with the results. Biodegradation is not likely because it is generally more rapid in soils with higher organic carbon content. In this case the soil with the least organic matter had the hazard degradation rate(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The half-life of the EC in oranges and lemons was 80-101 days, whereas the concentration of the WP declined by about 50% in the first 10 days and then declined more gradually. Processing of the residue-containing citrus peel into dry citrus cattle feed resulted in a 40% reduction in residue(3). In the national Total Diet Study covering FY 1970-76, dioxathion was infrequently detected - 19 samples of large fruit and 1 sample of small fruit out of 7893 samples analyzed, and 1 sample of root vegetable out of 3857 samples of domestic and imported vegetables analyzed(2).",

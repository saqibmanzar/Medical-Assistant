PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

In the presence of hepatic microsomes from Aroclor 1254-pretreated rats or the cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase system purified to near homogeneity from these microsomes, benzo(e)pyrene, trans-9,10-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene (bay region dihydrodiol), and trans-9,10-dihydroxy-9,10,11,12-tetrahydrobenzo(e)pyrene were metabolized to products which had little or no mutagenic activity toward strains TA 98 and TA 100 of Salmonella typhimurium. Under the same assay conditions, the products formed from trans-4,5-dihydroxy-4,5-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene (K-region dihydrodiol) had modest mutagenic activity. In contrast with these results, 9,10-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene was metabolically activated to potent mutagenic products which were 10- to 25-fold more active than the products formed from benzo(e)pyrene. The high intrinsic mutagenic activity of the chemically synthesized benzo ring tetrahydroepoxide of 9,10-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene in both strains of bacteria and in cultured Chinese hamster V79 cells suggested that the high mutagenicity of 9,10-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene after metabolism was mediated by this bay region tetrahydroepoxide. Liver microsomal metabolites of several of the benzo(e)pyrene derivatives were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography. Incubation of 9,10-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene with hepatic microsomes from untreated or Aroclor 1254-pretreated rats confirmed the metabolic formation of the benzo ring epoxide of 9,10-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene and established the formation of several other metabolites. In contrast to these results, trans-9,10-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene was not metabolized to benzo ring diol epoxides but rather was converted to 4,5,9,10-tetrahydroxy-4,5,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo(e)pyrene along with three phenolic derivatives of the dihydrodiol. Thus, lack of formation of a benzo ring epoxide provides a rationale for the inability of 9,10-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydrobenzo(e)pyrene to be metabolically activated by rat liver enzymes to mutagenic products and may contribute to the low carcinogenic activity of benzo(e)pyrene in rodents.",

These cells lack the enzymes necessary to convert PAHs to DNA-binding metabolites. ... 11 PAHs, i.e., benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), benz[a]anthracene, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, 3-methylcholanthrene, fluoranthene, anthanthrene, 11H-benzo[b]fluorene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, pyrene, benzo[ghi]perylene and benzo[e]pyrene caused DNA strand breaks even without external metabolic activation, while naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and naphthacene were inactive. When the comet assay was performed in the dark or when yellow fluorescent lamps were used for illumination the DNA-damaging effect of the 11 PAHs disappeared. White fluorescent lamps exhibit emission maxima at 334.1, 365.0, 404.7, and 435.8 nm representing spectral lines of mercury. In the case of yellow fluorescent lamps these emissions were absent. Obviously, under standard laboratory illumination many PAHs are photo-activated, resulting in DNA-damaging species. This feature of PAHs should be taken into account when these compounds are employed for the initiation of skin cancer. ...",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Previous studies from /the author's/ laboratory reported that benzo(a)pyrene (Bap) influenced efflux transport of rhodamine 123 (Rho-123) by induction of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in Caco-2 cells. The present study investigated whether induction of P-gp and the enhanced efflux transport of Rho-123 were caused by benzo(e)pyrene (Bep), which has a structure similar to Bap, but is not a carcinogenic compound. In Caco-2 monolayer exposed to 50 uM Bep for 72 hr, the ratio of the apparent permeability coefficient (P(app)) of Rho-123 efflux increased significantly compared to that of the control monolayer. Similarly, a significant increase in expression of MDR1 mRNA and of P-gp at the protein level were detected by RT-PCR and by Western blot analysis, respectively, in Caco-2 cells exposed to Bep, compared to that of the control. Caco-2 cells exposed to Bep showed oxidative stress that was detected by fluorescence microscopy using aminophenyl fluorescein. However, the oxidative stress was weaker compared with that of Bap. The cellular GSH content was decreased to 80% or 59% of control cells, respectively, in Caco-2 cells exposed to either Bep or Bap. Our results further show that Bep or Bap-induced P-gp in Caco-2 cells might have been the result of oxidative stress rather than DNA damage.",

The dose of benzo[a]pyrene used was 20 nmol/mouse a dose which is not carcinogenic in a single application but is carcinogenic after multiple treatments such as those in the benzo[a]pyrene-benzo[e]pyrene co-carcinogenesis experiments described by Van Duuren and Goldschmidt. After 3 hr of exposure to [(3)H]benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[e]pyrene at benzo[a]pyrene:benzo[e]pyrene dose ratios of 1:3 and 1:10, [(3)H]benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adducts in both benzo[e]pyrene-treated groups were lower than in an acetone-benzo[a]pyrene control group. After 12 and 24 hr of exposure the benzo[a]pyrene-benzo[e]pyrene (1:10) group contained 19% and 33% higher [(3)H]benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adduct levels than the control. In the benzo[a]pyrene-benzo[e]pyrene 11:3) group the amount of [(3)H]benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adduct levels was higher than the control after 12 hr. Benzo[e]pyrene cotreatment with either [(3)H]benzo[a]pyrene-7 8-dihydrodiol or anti-[(3)H]benzo[a]pyrene had no effect on the amount of benzo[a]pyrene DE-DNA adducts present. These results demonstrate that the cocarcinogen benzo[e]pyrene increases the amount of a low dose of benzo[a]pyrene that binds to mouse epidermal DNA and indicate that the increase in benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adducts results from increased metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene to the proximate carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene-7 8-dihydrodiol.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: B(e)P is a toxic element in cigarette smoke. It is a toxicant to human retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro. It causes cell death and induces apoptosis by the involvement of multiple caspase pathways. Human microvascular endothelial cells exposed to B(e)P showed a decrease in cell viability. It induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in HeLa cells in the presence of an exogenous metabolic system. The agent is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. ANIMAL STUDIES: It has been observed to cause violent uveitis when injected intraocularly in animal eyes. One study  showed that B(e)P is a very weak tumor initiator, a weak complete carcinogen, a moderate tumor promoter, possibly a weak co-tumor-initiator when given with benzo(a)pyrene, and a potent anit-tumor-initiator when given with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene. In another study, a group of 20 female mice received applications of a 0.1% solution of benzo(e)pyrene by skin painting for life. Of five animals that survived 13 months after the start of treatment, two had skin papillomas and three had carcinomas. In other experiment, 30 female mice received 100 ug benzo(e)pyrene by skin application for 30 weeks. At 30 weeks, 68% of the mice had papillomas (2.1 papillomas/mouse); and at 40 weeks, 24% of mice had carcinomas. Benzo(e)pyrene was mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of an exogenous metabolic system. It did not induce mitotic recombination in yeast. It did not induce mutations or sister chromatid exchange in cultured mammalian cells and was negative in assays for morphological transformation. In the one available report, it did not induce chromosomal aberrations in vitro. In the one available in-vivo study, it induced sister chromatid exchange, but not chromosomal aberrations in hamster bone marrow.",

In this research, we studied the photoirradiation of isomeric methylbenzo[a]pyrene (MBaP) and methylbenzo[e]pyrene (MBeP) by UVA light in the presence of a lipid, methyl linoleate, and evaluated the potential of these compounds to induce lipid peroxidation. The compounds chosen for study included BaP, 3-MBaP, 4-MBaP, 6-MBaP, 7-MBaP, 10-MBaP, BeP, 4-MBeP, and 9-MBeP. The results indicate that upon photoirradiation by UVA at 7 and 21 J/sq cm, these compounds induced lipid peroxidation. The levels of the induced lipid peroxidation were similar among BaP and the isomeric MBaPs, and among the BeP and MBePs, with the BaP group higher than the BeP group. There was also a co-relation between the UV A light dose and the level of lipid peroxidation induced. Lipid peroxide formation was inhibited by NaN3 (singlet oxygen and free radical scavenger) and was enhanced by the presence of deuterium oxide (D2O) (extends singlet oxygen lifetime). These results suggest that photoirradiation of MBaPs and MBePs by UVA light generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce lipid peroxidation.",

All surviving animals were killed 28 months after the start of exposure. Benzo(e)pyrene did not induce tumors in tracheal explants, while 1 mg benzo(a)pyrene induced carcinomas in 65% of the grafts. Benzo(e)pyrene appeared to reduce the incidence of carcinomas from 65% (benzo(a)pyrene alone) to 40% (benzo(a)pyrene plus benzo(e)pyrene).

Previously, we established an in vitro assay for TPO activity based on human recombinant TPO (hrTPO) stably transfected into human follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC-238) cells. It is important to determine whether environmental chemicals can disrupt TPO activity because it is an important factor in the TH axis. In this study, we used our assay to examine the changes in TPO activity in response to various chemicals, including benzophenones (BPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Overall, BPs, PAHs, and POPs slightly altered TPO activity at low doses, as compared with the positive controls methimazole (MMI), genistein, and 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxy BP. Benzophenone, benzhydrol, 3-methylchloranthracene, pyrene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(e)pyrene, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and heptachlor decreased TPO activity, while 2,4-dihydroxy BP, 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxy BP, and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene increased TPO activity. From these data, we can predict the disruption of TPO activity by various chemicals as a sensitive TH end point. TPO activity should be considered when enacting measures to regulate environmental exposure to thyroid-disrupting chemicals.",

Cells were treated for 24 hours with 1000 uM, 400 uM, 200 uM, and 100 uM B(e)P. Cell viability was determined by a trypan blue dye-exclusion assay. Activities of caspase-3/7, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-12 were measured by a fluorescence image scanner, and DNA laddering was evaluated by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gel. The mean percentage of cell viabilities of ARPE-19 cells was decreased in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to B(e)P at the higher concentrations of 1000 uM (20.0 +/- 0.4; p<0.001), 400 uM (35.6 +/- 6.4; p<0.001), and 200 uM (58.7 +/- 2.3; p<0.001) but not at 100 uM (95.9 +/- 0.7; p>0.05) compared with the equivalent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated control cultures. There were significant increases in caspase-3/7, -8, -9, and -12 activities compared with the DMSO-treated controls (p<0.001). DNA laddering revealed bands at 200-bp intervals. These results show that B(e)P is a toxicant to human retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro. It causes cell death and induces apoptosis by the involvement of multiple caspase pathways.",

R28 cells and HMVEC were treated for 24 hours with 1000, 400, 200, and 100 uM of B(e)P. Cell viability was measured by dye exclusion assay. Caspase-3/7, -8, -9, and -12 activities were measured by fluorochrome assays. DNA ladder was run on agarose gel, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release rate was evaluated using a LDH cytotoxicity kit II. R28 cells exposed to B(e)P 1000 and 400 uM showed a decrease in cell viability but not at lower concentrations of 200 and 100 uM. At 400, 200, and 100 uM B(e)P, there was an increase in caspase-3/7 and at 200 and 100 uM B(e)P caspase-12 activities. Caspase-8 activity was increased only at 200 uM B(e)P. Caspase-9 activity was not increased at any concentration. DNA ladder revealed bands at 200 bp intervals at lower concentrations and LDH activity at higher concentrations. HMVEC cultures exposed to B(e)P 1000, 400, and 200 uM showed a decrease in cell viability. Caspase-3/7 activity was not increased at any concentration. DNA laddering revealed no bands at 200 bp intervals at any dose. LDH release rates increased at all three concentrations. However, 100 uM B(e)P was found safe on HMVEC. B(e)P has different mechanisms of action on R28 cells and HMVEC at different concentrations. In R28 cells, 200 and 100 uM of B(e)P causes activation of caspase-3/7, -8 (200 uM only) and -12 pathways, leading to apoptotic cell death, but, at higher concentrations, there is non-apoptotic cell death, which could be due to necrosis. In contrast, the HMVEC cell death is through non-caspase-dependent necrosis pathway. The molecular mechanisms of cell death vary with different cell types and concentrations of B(e)P.",

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether DNA binding events are critically involved in the progression of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-mediated atherogenesis. Apolipoprotein E knockout mice were orally (24 wk, once/wk) exposed to 5 mg/kg benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), or its nonmutagenic, noncarcinogenic structural isoform benzo[e]pyrene (B[e]P). (32)P-postlabeling of lung tissue confirmed the presence of promutagenic PAH-DNA adducts in B[a]P-exposed animals, whereas in B[e]P-exposed and vehicle control animals, these adducts were undetectable. Morphometrical analysis showed that both B[a]P and B[e]P caused an increase in plaque size, whereas location or number of plaques was unaffected. Immunohistochemistry revealed no differences in oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG) or apoptosis in the plaques. Also plasma lipoprotein levels remained unchanged after PAH-exposure. However, T lymphocytes were increased >/= 2-fold in the plaques of B[a]P- and B[e]P-exposed animals. Additionally, B[a]P and to a lesser extent B[e]P exposure resulted in increased TGFbeta protein levels in the plaques, that was mainly localized in the plaque macrophages. In vitro studies using the murine macrophage like RAW264.7 cells showed that inhibition of TGFbeta resulted in decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha release, suggesting that enhanced TGFbeta expression in the plaque macrophages contributes to the proinflammatory effects in the vessel wall. In general, this inflammatory reaction in the plaques appeared to be a local response since peripheral blood cell composition (T cells, B cells, granulocytes, and macrophages) was not changed upon PAH exposure. In conclusion, we showed that both B[a]P and B[e]P cause progression of atherosclerosis, irrespective of their DNA binding properties. Moreover, our data revealed a possible novel mechanism of PAH-mediated atherogenesis, which likely involves a TGFbeta-mediated local inflammatory reaction in the vessel wall.",

All of the strong mammalian carcinogens tested (benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), pyrene, aflatoxin B(1), 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) and cis-dichlorodihydroxydiamminoplatinum IV) were also shown to be strong Drosophila blastomogens. They induced several times more tumors than their counterparts that are less carcinogenic for mammals (4-acetylaminofluorene (4-AAF), aflatoxins B(2) and G(2)) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(-3-pyridine)-1-butanone (NNK). Benzo(e)pyrene (B(e)P) and pyrene demonstrated minor effects. Most tumors were localized on the wing and notum, which are the derivatives of the wing disc. Humeri derived from dorsal prothoracic disc and the abdominal tergites and sternites had the lowest number of tumors. The tumor frequency in the cross of the wild type females with wts(P2)/TM6B males was different from that in the reciprocal cross. The former type of cross exhibited consistently higher tumor frequency both in the experimental and control series.",

To understand the basis of roles of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 in the activation of chemical carcinogens, we compared levels of induction of liver and lung CYP1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 by various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls in AhR(+/+) and AhR(-/-) mice. Liver and lung CYP1A1 and 1B1 mRNAs were highly induced in AhR(+/+) mice by a single intraperitoneal injection of each of the carcinogenic PAHs, such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, dibenz[a,l]pyrene, 3-methylcholanthrene, 1,2,5,6-dibenzanthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benzo[a]anthracene and by a co-planar PCB congener 3,4,3',4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl. We also found that 6-aminochrysene, chrysene, benzo[e]pyrene, and 1-nitropyrene weakly induced the mRNA expression of CYP1A1 and 1B1, whereas anthracene, pyrene, and fluoranthene that have been reported to be non-carcinogenic in rodents, were very low or inactive in inducing these P450s. The extents of induction of liver CYP1A2 by these chemicals were less than those of CYP1A1 and 1B1 in AhR(+/-/+/-) mice. In AhR(-/-) mice, there was no induction of these P450s by PAHs and polychlorinated biphenyls. Liver microsomal activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylations and of mutagenic activation of (+/-)-trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydro-B[a]P to DNA-damaging products were found to correlate with levels of CYP1A1 and 1B1 mRNAs in the liver. Our results suggest that carcinogenicity potencies of PAHs may relate to the potencies of these compounds to induce CYP1A1 and 1B1 through AhR-dependent manner and that these induced P450s participate in the activation of B[a]P and related carcinogens causing initiation of cancers in mice.",

Benzo(e)pyrene has been identified in mainstream cigarette smoke, sidestream cigarette smoke, mainstream of marijuana cigarettes, emissions from burning various types of coal, fresh and used motor oils, gasolines, charcoal-broiled steaks, and smoked and cooked food. Benzo(e)pyrene is released to the atmosphere in exhaust emissions from gasoline and diesel engines. Benzo(e)pyrene occurs in crude oil and bituminous coal. There is no commercial production or known use for benzo(e)pyrene. If released to air, an extrapolated super-cooled vapor pressure of 5.7X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzo(e)pyrene will exist primarily in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. However, a small percentage will exist is the vapor phase. Both vapor-phase and particulate-phase benzo(e)pyrene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-lives for each of these reactions in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours. Particulate-phase benzo(e)pyrene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benzo(e)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzo(e)pyrene is expected to have no mobility based upon a measured Koc of 6.9X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.0X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Benzo(e)pyrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Limited biodegradation data suggest that biodegradation in soil is slow; 87% of the initial benzo(e)pyrene remained after 1280 days of incubation. If released into water, benzo(e)pyrene  is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. In general, PAHs with five or more benzene rings do not biodegrade readily. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 8200 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to benzo(e)pyrene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzo(e)pyrene is produced as a product of incomplete combustion. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzo(e)pyrene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing benzo(e)pyrene.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.0X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its extrapolated vapor pressure, 5.7X10-9 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 0.0063 mg/L(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 8200(SRC), from its log Kow of 6.44(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(9). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 1.1 days has been reported for the analogous compound benzo(a)pyrene(10). Benzo(e)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(14) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on water surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC). Benzo(e)pyrene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Limited biodegradation data, specific to benzo(e)pyrene, suggest that biodegradation is slow(11,12). In general, PAHs with five or more benzene rings do not biodegrade readily(13).",

Based on an estimated super-cooled vapor pressure of 1.8X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(3), a small percentage of benzo(e)pyrene is expected to exist in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere(1). Similar PAHs have been detected in the vapor phase in ambient air(4,5). Vapor-phase benzo(e)pyrene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase benzo(e)pyrene is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is also estimated to be 7.7 hours(SRC), calculated from a measured rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(6). Particulate-phase benzo(e)pyrene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Benzo(e)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(7,8) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The following half-lives (in hrs) were determined for the photolysis (using a rotary photoreactor, 300 to 410 nm) of benzo(e)pyrene absorbed on various substrates(3): silica gel, 70 hr; alumina, 110 hr; fly ash, 35 hr; carbon black, >1000 hr(3). Additional photolysis studies with 15 different types of coal fly ash found that half-lives are highly dependent upon substrate. Photolytic half-lives varied from 64.5 to >1000 hr; the dominant factor in preventing atmospheric photodegradation is the color of the absorbing substrate(4). Fly ash samples that stabilize PAH reaction absorb the most light and prevent light from getting to the PAH(4). PAHs are stabilized when the carbon content of the fly ash is greater than 5%(4). The photolysis of benzo(e)pyrene sorbed to the surface of spruce needles, (Picea Abies), follows first-order kinetics with a half-life of 32 hours under sunlight irradiation(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Rain and snow samples collected on Isle Royale (northern Lake Superior) in 1983 had average benzo(e)pyrene concentrations of 1.1 and 6 ng/L, respectively(2). Fog water collected near Zurich Switzerland had a mean benzo(e)pyrene concentration of ng/L(3); analysis of rain and snow water revealed that most benzo(e)pyrene (68-99+%) occurs in the particulate phase as compared to the dissolved phase(3). Monitoring of rainwater samples from Portland, OR during Feb 1984 found a mean dissolved-phase concentration of 0.37 ng/L(4). The particulate-phase concentration was 3.0 ng/L(5). Mean total benzo(e)pyrene rain concentrations in the Chesapeake Bay region between June 1990 and Dec 1991 ranged from 0.3 to 30 ng/L(6). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in cloud water collected in the spring of 1991 in the Vosges mountains, Alsace, France, at concentrations ranging from 6 to 489 ng/L, mean concentration 45 ng/L(7). Snowpack sampled in Fairbanks, Alaska in 2009 contained a benzo(e)pyrene levels of 11 ng/L(8).",

Analysis of diesel engine emissions found benzo(e)pyrene levels of 41 to 90 ng/cu m(2). Based upon monitoring data of urban runoff (from storm water drains) collected in Rhode Island, approximately 23.9 kg benzo(e)pyrene/yr are input to the Narragansett Bay Watershed(3). Oil leachates collected from a sanitary landfill in Germany contained benzo(e)pyrene levels of 120 mg/kg(4). Combustion of Alberta Sweet crude oil yielded 90 to 140 ug benzo(e)pyrene/g of soot effluent(5). Emissions of benzo(e)pyrene from various gasoline fueled engines ranged from 0.63 to 2.7 ug/km driven(6); emission from a diesel engine was 0.15 ug/km driven(7). Char-broiling of extra-lean and regular hamburger was found to emit 0.03 to 0.19 mg benzo(e)pyrene/kg meat(8); it was suggested that meat cooking operations may be an important source of organic aerosol emissions in Los Angeles, CA(8). Samples of urban runoff collected in Madrid contained benzo(e)pyrene at a mean annual concentartion of 0.4 ug/L(9).",

Incineration and open burning of municipal refuse, automobile tires, etc, the benzo(e)pyrene emission levels ranged from 0.08 to 6.5 mg/kg of particulate matter for a municipal incinerator, 49 to 180 mg/kg particulate matter for a commercial incinerator, and 4.5 to 450 mg/kg of particulate matter in open burning(1). Air from two gas works and one electrochemical plant contained benzo(e)pyrene at concentrations ranging from 100 to 150 ug/1000 cu m. In domestic coal combustion effluent the benzo(e)pyrene concentration was 500 mg/1000 cu m. Up to 4300 mg/1000 cu m benzo(e)pyrene was detected in industrial effluents(1). Benzo(e)pyrene was identified as a constituent of exhaust from internal combustion engines. The benzo(e)pyrene output of 8 automobiles was 4.7 to 31.6 ug/mile. The benzo(e)pyrene output of four diesel trucks was 48 ug/mile(1). Average benzo(e)pyrene concentrations in the emissions of coke ovens, diesel engines, highway tunnels, gasoline engines, and wood combustion in the Chicago metropolitan area during 1990 to 1992 were 0.0116, 0.130, 0.0555, 0.122, and 0.197 ug/cu m, respectively(2). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in coke battery exhausts at a concentration of 0.9 ng/cu m(3). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected at concentrations of 355 and 1100 ng/L in gas scrubber wastewater from Norwegian aluminum works(4). Tunnel monitoring of light and heavy duty vehicles in California in 2004 determined mean benzo(e)pyrene emission factors of 4.42 and 60.80 ug/kg fuel burned respectively(5). Exhaust emission factors of benzo(e)pyrene from various European diesel and gasoline vehicles ranged from 0.04 to 2.47 ug/km(6). [",

Sediments collected from the Chesapeake Bay between 1984 and 1986 had benzo(e)pyrene levels of 2 to 150 ug/kg(2). Sediment cores collected from the southern basin of Lake Michigan in Aug and Sep 1978 contained levels of 20 to 300 ng/g benzo(e)pyrene(3). Analysis of sediment cores from two remote Adirondack Lakes (Sagamore and Woods Lake) found benzo(e)pyrene concentrations of 87 to 770 ng/g dry wt in the upper 11 cm of depth(4); concentrations at depths of 12 to 84 cm were only 1 to 10 ng/g(4). Concentrations of benzo(e)pyrene in laminated sediments collected from the northern Baltic proper were, ug/g C (sediment layer, mm): 1.4 (0 to 1.8); 1.9 (1.8 to 3.6); 1.7 (3.6 to 5.4); 2.1 (7.2 to 9.0); 2.3 (10.8 to 12.6); 3.4 (16.2 to 18.0); 3.7 (21.6 to 23.4); 4.4 (27.0 to 28.8); 5.1 (32.4 to 34.2) and 4.4 (37.8 to 39.6)(5). Sediment cores collected from 17 locations on the Washington continental shelf and slope contained benzo(e)pyrene at concentrations of, ug/g organic carbon: inner shelf, 1.4 and 1.7; midshelf, 1.6 to 2.5; outer shelf, 0.5 and 1.1; slope, 0.3 to 1.1; and 22 to 24 cm (Pleistocene gray clay), 1.8(6). Surficial sediments collected from St. Mary's River in 1985 contained benzo(e)pyrene at concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 37.0 mg/kg dry weight(7). Sediment samples collected from 5 regions of Casco Bay, Maine in Aug 1991 contained benzo(e)pyrene (concentration range, ppm dry weight): Inner Bay (37 to 514); West Bay (14 to 74); East Bay (37 to 276); Cape Small (1 to 271); and Outer Bay (48 to 140)(8). Surficial sediments and surface water suspended solids sampled from Lake Superior contained benzo(e)pyrene at mean concentrations of 74.6 and 15 ng/g, respectively(9). Surface sediments collected at four sites of the Susquehanna River in 2000 had average benzo(e)pyrene concentrations ranging from 69.36 to 272.55 ng/g dry wt(10).",

The benzo(e)pyrene concentration (in ug/g dry wt) of sediment from various US locations has been reported as follows: Charles River MA, 33; Elliot Bay WA, 4; Commencement Bay WA, 1; Newton Creek NY, 1; Elizabeth River VA, 6(2). Sediment and suspended solids collected from Lake Superior in 1984 to 1985 had levels of approximately 10-100 ng/g(3). Benzo(e)pyrene concentrations of 0.068 to 21.0 ug/g dry wt were detected in sediments from 5 rivers that feed the Great Lakes(4). The highest concentrations were found in the Black River which is known to be contaminated by the steel and coking industries(4). Benzo(e)pyrene concentrations in sediment cores from Tilbury docks on the River Thames, UK were, ug/g dry sediment (depth below OD (Ordnance Datum Newlyn, OD, is the mean sea level at Newlyn as defined by the Government Survey of Great Britain), cm): 1.21 (445-455), 1.33 (465-474), 1.55 (484-494), 1.35 (504-514), 1.81 (523-533), 1.41 (543-553), 1.35 (563-572), 2.02 (582-592), 3.46 (602-612), 3.94 (621-631), 4.08 (641-651), 3.57 (661-670), 3.09 (680-690), 3.19 (700-710), 2.88 (719-729), 3.81 (739-749), 2.47 (759-768), 3.77 (778-798), 3.54 (798-808), 4.34 (817-827) and 4.68 (837-847)(5). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in sediments from Eagle Harbor, Puget Sound, WA and President Point, WA at concentrations ranging from 250 to 2000 ng/g dry weight in Eagle Harbor and 43 ng/g dry weight in President Point sediment(6). 26 of 28 superlayer and underlayer deep sea sediment samples from 15 sampling sites in the Gulf of Lion, Mediterranean Sea, France were found to contain benzo(e)pyrene at concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 246.6 ng/g dry weight. The benzo(e)pyrene concentration in a sediment sample from the Grand Rhone River, located downstream from a highly industrialized and urbanized area, was 498.8 ng/g dry sediment(7).",

Monitoring conducted in South Kensington London between Oct 1985 and Dec 1987 found an average winter benzo(e)pyrene concentration of 2.72 ng/cu m and an average summer concentration of 1.14 ng/cu m(2). Benzo(e)pyrene ranged in concentrations from 0.15 to 0.88 ng/cu m, mean 0.40, in air samples collected in Aug to Sept 1989 from Brazzaville, Congo(3). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in air samples collected along Exhibition Road, London between 1/91 and 7/92 at concentrations ranging from 0.36 to 13.83 ng/cu m, average concentrations 5.08 ng/cu m(4). Monitoring conducted between Nov 1976 and Jan 1979 at two sites in Great Britain (urban and suburban) found benzo(e)pyrene levels of <0.1 to 4.6 ng/cu m(5); the average concentration was about 1.5 ng/cu m(5). 24-hour samples of airborne particulates were sampled from two sites. Site 1 was located at the center of the city and site 2 was located in the industrial zone of the city, in Thessaloniki, Greece. During a one year period starting in 7/87 the sites were found to contain benzo(e)pyrene at mean concentrations of 3.3 and 4.3 ng/cu m, respectively(6). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in particulate matter collected from a street in central Copenhagen, in a city park, and in a street carrying only diesel buses at 4.4, 1.3, and 0.8 ng/cu m, respectively(7). Airborne particulate matter collected in Barcelona city contained benzo(e)pyrene at concentrations ranging from 1.96 to 3.97 ng/cu m; the highest concentration occurred in the spring(8). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in the particulate phase of air samples collected from Kosnica, Croatia in Feb and Aug of 1990 at mean concentrations of 3.10 and 1.92 ng/cu m, respectively(9). Airborne particulate samples collected from the Upper Silesia region of Poland, in the winter of 1988-89 and the summer of 1989, were found to contain benzo(e)pyrene (number of times detected, concentration range in ng/cu m): winter (9, 3.6 to 28.8) and summer (8, 2.1 to 20.0)(10). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in air samples from South Kensington, UK at mean concentrations of 1.08, 2.00, and 0.31 ng/cu m for particulates collected between 1985 to 1986, for particulates collected in 1987, and for gas phase benzo(e)pyrene collected in 1987, respectively(11). Air monitoring conducted at two stations in Hong Kong between 1998-2005 detected average benzo(e)pyrene concentrations ranging from 0.11-1.01 ng/cu m(12). Air monitoring conducted at 9 stations in Hanoi, Vietnam in the early 2000s found average particulate phase and gas phase concentrations of 1.8 and 0.09 ng/cu m respectively(13).",

Soot collected from open fire burning of various types of coal and wood had benzo(e)pyrene levels of 2 to 39 ppm(6). Average benzo(e)pyrene emissions for the burning of the following wood, ug/kg: almond, 17; walnut, 18; fir, 54; and pine, 24(7). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected at a level of 31.9 ppm in coal tar from the Sydney Steel Corporation's facility at Sydney, Nova Scotia(8). It was found in coal tar and carbon black at 6.1 mg/g and 190 ug/g(9). Emissions of benzo(e)pyrene from the burning of various types of coal have been reported as 0.02 to 10.3 mg/kg(1). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in bituminous coal(10). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in smoke particulates from 10 brands of cigarettes at levels of 3.0-12.4 ng/cigarette(11).",

Air monitoring in a Norwegian plant producing electrode pastes for use in electric smelting furnaces found upper limit benzo(e)pyrene concentrations of 0.8 ug/cu m(2). Average exposure to workers in aluminum refinery, silicon carbide and refractory brick industries was determined to be about 1 ug/cu m(3). The mean benzo(e)pyrene exposure to workers in a factory that impregnates wood with creosote was 0.03 ug/cu m(4). Emissions generated during the pouring, cooling, and shakeout of castings made with the evaporative pattern casting process contained benzo(e)pyrene at concentrations of 34 and 11 ug/kg for aluminum and iron castings, respectively(5). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in the workplace air of a coke plant at a concentration of 1.0 ng/cu m(6). Stationary air samples collected near the ovens of two silicon carbide process plants contained benzo(e)pyrene concentrations ranging from 120 to 1219 ng/cu m in one plant and 279 to 313 ng/cu m in the second plant(7). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in air samples (taken at breathing height using personal sampling pumps) collected in the furnace area of two silicon carbide process plants at concentrations (ng/cu m) ranging from (Plant A and B): 42 to 200 and 279 to 777 for the foreman; 18 to 104 and 266 to 1879 for the crane operator; 176 to 320 and 360 to 458 for oven workers whose tasks were in close proximity to the oven; and 1086 to 3844 and 385 to 632 for oven workers whose tasks did not involve direct work at the oven site(7). Benzo(e)pyrene was detected in air samples (taken at breathing height using personal sampling pumps) of 6 workers in a plant producing carbon anodes for aluminum electrolysis, worksite, concentration of benzo(e)pyrene (ug/cu m): forming section, 0.64 to 1.97; paste plant, 1.01 to 3.83; store section (broken green anodes and burned anodes), 0.13 to 0.55; forming section, 1.51 to 3.27; store section (coke) paste plant, 0.14 to 1.50; and all worksites, 0.22 to 3.34(8).",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

AEGLs are used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures.  AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Place towels in a safe place such as a fume hood for evaporation. Allow sufficient time for evaporation of the vapors so that the the hood ductwork is free from ethyl mercaptan vapors. Burn the paper in a suitable location away from combustible materials. 4. Large quantities of liquids containing ethyl mercaptan may be absorbed in vermiculite, dry sand, earth, or a similar material and placed in an appropriate container. Ethyl mercaptan should not be allowed to enter a confined space such as a sewer because of the possibility of an explosion. 5. Liquids containing ethyl mercaptan may be collected by vacuuming with an appropriate system. If a vacuum system is used, there should be no sources of ignition in the vicinity of the spill, and flashback prevention devices should be provided.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

                                "Description": "In general, the occupational exposure limit (OEL) indicates the level of admissible exposure, for a length of time (usually 8 hours), to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health of a worker. The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Medical surveillance for respiratory disease should be conducted by using the principles and methods recommended by NIOSH and the American Thoracic Society (ATS). A preplacement medical evaluation is recommended in order to detect and assess preexisting or concurrent conditions which may be aggravated or result in increased risk when a worker is exposed to n-butyl mercaptan at or below the NIOSH REL.

Ethyl mercaptan occurs in some vegetables (such as cabbage), mammalian excretion products, manure gas from domestic animal pens, in various crude oils and in natural gas; it is formed by biological processes. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 529 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl mercaptan will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl mercaptan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 hours. Ethyl mercaptan does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethyl mercaptan is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 22. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.53X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyl mercaptan may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, ethyl mercaptan is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 hours and 3.2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 2.7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to ethyl mercaptan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl mercaptan is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ethyl mercaptan via inhalation of air in the vicinity of natural gas refineries (through usde as an odorant) and municipal waste sites, and dermally in preparation or ingestion of certain meats and vegetables.

The occurrence of small amounts of alkyl mercaptans in crude oil is believed to result from microbial action on elemental sulfur(3). Mercaptans are formed naturally in biological processes and exist in all living systems(3-4); the lower alkyl mercaptans occur in manure gas from domestic animal pens(3).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 10 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The hydroxyl radical reaction proceeds primarily through OH addition to the sulfur(1); based upon chamber experiments with similar sulfur compounds(2), the reaction products may include ethylsulfonic acid(SRC). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of ethyl mercaptan with atmospheric nitrate radicals has been experimentally determined to be 1.2X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3) which corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1 hr at an atmospheric concn of 2X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(SRC); the nitrate radical occurs in the lower troposphere during nighttime hours(4). Ethyl mercaptan is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(5). Ethyl mercaptan does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

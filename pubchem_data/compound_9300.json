When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Miosis, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea & frequency of urination ... Nicotinic effects consist of fasciculation of muscles, weakness & paralysis. Central nervous system effects include nervousness, apprehension, ataxia, convulsions & coma. Death is due to resp failure, or sometimes cardiac arrest.

Respiratory distress, in fact, is commonly found in these patients from multiple causes. ... 4. Cardiac Monitoring. ... 5. Cholinesterase Level. ... 6. Pralidoxime. Pralidoxime is the treatment of choice for organophosphate poisoning and should be used for nearly all patients with clinically significant orgnophosphate poisoning, particularly whose patients with muscular fasciculations and weakness. ... 7. Atropine. Atropine is the physiologic antidote for organophosphate poisoning. A trial dose of atropine should be instituted on clinical ground when one suspects organophosphate intoxication. /Organophosphate poisoning/",

If released into the atmosphere, ruelene will exist both in the vapor phase and as particulate matter in the ambient atmosphere, based on an estimated vapor pressure of 3.8X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor phase ruelene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 11 hours. An estimated Koc value of 1,700 suggests that ruelene will have low mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.5X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces should not be important given the vapor pressure of this compound. Biodegradation data for ruelene are not available. In water, ruelene is expected to adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its Koc value. This compound is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms should be high based upon an estimated BCF value of 230. Given the commercial uses of ruelene, human exposure appears to be likely from occupational situations through dermal and inhalation routes. The general population will be exposed to ruelene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food, and dermal contact with vapors, food and other products containing ruelene. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Human data are considered inadequate in providing evidence of cancer by exposure to bromoform, while animal data indicate that long-term oral exposure can cause liver and intestinal tumors.

It is a trihalomethane, and is one of the four haloforms, the others being fluoroform, chloroform, and iodoform. Bromoform can be prepared by the haloform reaction using acetone and sodium hypobromite, by the electrolysis of potassium bromide in ethanol, or by treating chloroform with aluminum bromide. Most of the bromoform that enters the environment is formed as disinfection byproducts known as the trihalomethanes when chlorine is added to drinking water or swimming pools to kill bacteria. In the past, it was used as a solvent, sedative and flame retardant, but now it is mainly used as a laboratory reagent. Bromine is a halogen element with the symbol Br and atomic number 35. Diatomic bromine does not occur naturally, but bromine salts can be found in crustal rock. (L625, L683)\n\n",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

THMs are metabolized by cytochromes P-450 and are likely substrates of CYP2E1. Therefore, it is possible that mixed exposure results in toxicokinetic interactions among THMs. The toxicokinetics of THMs during mixed exposures has not been investigated previously. The purpose of this study was to characterize the blood kinetics of the four THMs administered singly or in combination in the rat. A single dose of 0.25 mmol/kg or 0.5 mmol/kg bw, of each THM alone, or of a quaternary mixture containing 0.25 mmol/kg of each THM (total dose of 1.0 mmol/kg) was administered by gavage. The venous blood concentrations of the THMs were measured by headspace gas chromatography (GC) at 20, 40, 60, 120, 180, 270 and 360 min post-administration. Results showed a nonlinear relationship between the area under the blood concentration versus time curves (AUCs) and administered doses of THMs, suggesting that metabolism is saturated in this dose range. The venous blood concentrations of THMs following administration of the quaternary mixture were significantly higher compared to single exposures. The altered kinetics of THMs during combined exposures is consistent with the occurrence of mutual inhibition of their hepatic metabolism...",

Linear mixed-effects model was utilized to calculate the steady-state permeability coefficients. The permeability coefficients of THMs ranged from 0.16 to 0.21 cm/hr when the donor solution was at 25 degrees C. Bromoform had the highest K(p) value, while chloroform was the least permeable through the skin. THMs were approximately 10 times more permeable than HKs, while the permeability of HAAs through the skin was very low (1 to 3 x 10-3 cm/hr, pH 7). The permeability of HKs tripled as the temperature was increased from room temperature (20 degrees C) to bathing temperature (40 degrees C). A direct relationship was found between the permeability of THMs, but not HKs and HAAs, and their octanol/water partition coefficients. The dermal dose from daily bathing activities was approximated for an average adult using U.S. EPA recommended methods and found to be 40-70% of the daily ingestion dose for the THMs, 10% of the ingestion dose for HKs, and an insignificant percentage of the ingestion dose for the HAAs. In addition to ingestion, dermal absorption is an important route of exposure to THMs and HKs ... .",

GSH alone did not serve as a cofactor; however, GSH in the presence of NADPH and oxygen produced an 8-fold increase in the metabolism of bromoform to CO. Similar results were obtained with other sulfhydryl compounds. The biotransformation of bromoform to CO was characterized with respect to time course, microsomal protein concentration, pH and temperature. The metabolism of haloforms to CO followed the halide order; thus, iodoform yielded the greatest amount of CO, whereas chloroform yielded the smallest amount. A KM of 6.78 +/- 2.71 mM was established for bromoform and the Vmax was 1.09 +/- 0.19 nmol of CO per mg of microsomal protein per min. The energy of activation for this reaction was 6.5 +/- 0.18 kcal/mol. Cytochrome P-450 was found to bind bromoform to produce a type I binding spectrum. Treatment of rats with phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene increased the rate of conversion of bromoform to CO. Cobaltous chloride treatment of rats or storage of microsomal preparations at 4 degrees C reduced the rate of formation of CO from bromoform. SKF 525-A inhibited the conversion of bromoform to CO. These results suggest that haloforms are metabolized to CO via a cytochrome P-450-dependent mixed-function oxidase system.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Bromoform is a halogenated alkane that exhibits anesthetic properties and has been shown by X-ray crystallography to bind to model anesthetic targets. In this study we report the ability of bromoform to potentiate GABA-induced current in recombinant GABA(A) receptors composed of alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s) subunits. Recent studies have shown that specific point mutations in the transmembrane (TM) region of the GABA(A) receptor alpha-subunit can selectively abolish the modulatory activity of specific general anesthetics, and that molecular volume is a key determinant of anesthetic activity. The action of bromoform was examined in a series of mutant receptors and compared with the activity profiles of three other volatile anesthetics. The pharmacological profile of bromoform at the mutant receptors used in this study was similar to that seen with halothane, and distinct from that observed for isoflurane and chloroform. The molecular volume of bromoform is closest to that of halothane, and therefore our data are consistent with the idea that molecular volume is an important determinant of inhaled anesthetic activity at the GABA(A) receptor.",

To support studies exploring the relation between exposure to trihalomethanes (THMs) and health effects, we have developed an automated analytical method using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. This method quantitates trace levels of THMs (chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) and methyl tertiary-butyl ether in tap water. Detection limits of less than 100 ng/L for all analytes and linear ranges of three orders of magnitude are adequate for measuring the THMs in tap water samples tested from across the United States...",

To support studies exploring the relation between exposure to trihalomethanes (THMs) and adverse health effects, an automated analytical method was developed using capillary gas chromatography (GC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) with selected ion mass detection and isotope-dilution techniques. This method quantified trace levels of THMs (including chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in human blood. Analyte responses were adequate for measuring background levels after extraction of these volatile organic compounds with either purge-and-trap extraction or headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The SPME method was chosen because of its ease of use and higher throughput. Detection limits for the SPME GC-MS method ranged from 0.3 to 2.4 ng/L, with linear ranges of three orders of magnitude. This method proved adequate for measuring the THMs and MTBE in most blood samples tested from a diverse U.S. reference population.",

Chronic (long-term) animal studies indicate effects on the liver, kidney, and central nervous system (CNS) from oral exposure to bromoform. Human data are considered inadequate in providing evidence of cancer by exposure to bromoform, while animal data indicate that long-term oral exposure can cause liver and intestinal tumors.

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this heavy, colorless to yellow liquid may occur from its use a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, as a flotation agent in mineral separation. Effects from exposure may include severe irritation of the skin, eyes and respiratory tract, pulmonary edema, headache, vertigo, amnesia, shock, unconsciousness, and convulsions. Both the OSHA PEL and the ACGIH TLV have been set at a TWA of 0.5 ppm. In activities or situations where over exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus, and full chemical protective clothing which is specifically recommended by the shipper or producer to prevent skin contact with bromoform. If contact should occur, immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, and remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. While bromoform is not easily ignited, it may burn with the release of toxic gases and vapors. Fires involving bromoform may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, fog, or standard foam. Bromoform should be stored in cool, dark areas, away from chemically active metals and strong caustics. Note that this substance will attack some forms of plastics, rubber, and coatings. Bromoform may be shipped via air, rail, road, and water, in containers bearing the label, \"Keep Away From Food\". Small spills of bromoform should be taken up with vermiculite, dry sand, earth, and placed into containers for later disposal. Large spills first should be diked far ahead of the spill area. Bromoform is a potential candidate for rotary kiln, liquid injection, and fluidized bed forms of incineration. Before implementing land disposal of waste bromoform, consult with regulatory agencies for guidance.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as intermediate in organic synthesis, geological assaying, solvent for waxes, greases, and oils. It is also used in hair treatment formulations. Bromoform was formerly used as an antiseptic and sedative. HUMAN STUDIES: Accidental ingestion of the liquid has produced central nervous system depression with coma and loss of reflexes; smaller doses have led to listlessness, headache, and vertigo. Exposure to bromoform vapor caused irritation of the respiratory tract, pharynx, and larynx, as well as lacrimation and salivation. Several cases of poisoning have occurred in children; some have had maximally constricted pupils, but others have had mydriasis, probably related to depth of depression of CNS. Bromoform induced sister chromatid exchanges and cell-cycle delays in human lymphocytes in vitro. ANIMAL STUDIES: Undiluted bromoform was moderately irritating to rabbit eyes, and healing was complete in 1 to 2 days. Repeated skin contact caused moderate irritation to rabbit skin. Inhalation of very high concentrations (56,000 or 84,000 ppm) of bromoform vapor for 1 hour has been reported to cause death in dogs. The chief symptoms noted were initial excitation followed by deep sedation. This indicates that central nervous system depression is probably the chief cause of death in such acute exposures. A single ip dose of 3 mmol/kg bw given to rats has also been shown to produce renal dysfunction, characterized by a reduction in glomerular filtration rate, reduced renal concentrating ability and elevated blood urea nitrogen levels. Following administration of bromoform by gavage to mice, changes included fatty infiltration of liver and signs of hemorrhage in kidneys, adrenals, lung, and brain. Males were more sensitive than females. In mice, bromoform has been observed to produce tubular hyperplasia and glomerular degeneration after an oral dose of 289 mg/kg bw daily for 14 days. No significant alterations in the number of resorption sites, fetuses per litter, fetal body weights, fetal malformations or visceral anomalies were observed in the offspring of rats administered up to 200 mg/kg/day bromoform in corn oil by oral gavage on gestational days 6-15. NTP studies demonstrated carcinogenic activity of bromoform in male and female rats but not in male or female mice. Bromoform exhibited mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the absence of metabolic activation and in strains TA97 and TA98 when exposure occurred in the presence of metabolic activation. Bromoform produced no increases in revertant colonies in TA1535 or TA1537 with or without metabolic activation. When tested in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells for cytogenetic effects, bromoform produced an increase in both sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in the absence, but not in the presence of metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Bromoform, chloroform, and tetrachloroethylene act synergistically to alter a key regulator of neuronal development in surf clam embryo.",

These free radicals are also potent oxidizers and produce tissue damage. In additon, the formation of hydrobromic and bromic acids will result in secondary irritation. The bromide ion is also known to affect the central nervous system, causing bromism. This is believed to be a result of bromide ions substituting for chloride ions in the in actions of neurotransmitters and transport systems, thus affecting numerous synaptic processes.

Reduced survival for male rats given 200 mg/kg tribromomethane lowered the sensitivity of this group to detect a carcinogenic response. Chemically related nonneoplastic lesions included fatty change and active chronic inflammation of the liver in male and female rats, minimal necrosis of the liver in male rats, and mixed cell foci of the liver in female rats. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice given 50 or 100 mg/kg tribromomethane or for female B6C3F1 mice given 100 or 200 mg/kg; male mice might have been able to tolerate a higher dose. Survival of female mice was reduced, partly due to a utero-ovarian infection.",

Exposure produced an increase in an isoform of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, demonstrated by confocal microscopy and western blotting. Embryos showed an increase in RII where the primordial gill and ciliated velar epithelium are innervated. This increase correlated with increased ciliary activity, indicating a corresponding rise in the catalytic subunit. Treatment resulted in decreased threonine phosphorylation of actin. There was no effect on neurotransmitters or receptors of the serotonergic-dopaminergic nervous system. These effects occurred only with the ternary mixture. No significant effect was seen with individual or paired components. This is the first report showing that bromoform, chloroform, and tetrachloroethylene act synergistically to alter a key regulator of neuronal development.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of chloroacetic acids on the pharmacokinetics of trihalomethanes in the male Sprague-Dawley rat. In the first series of studies, groups of 5 animals were given, by intravenous injections, a single dose of 0.125 mmol/kg of one of the four THMs. Additional groups received a binary mixture containing 0.125 mmol/kg of a THM plus 0.125 mmol/kg of a chloroacetic acid. The venous blood concentrations of unchanged THMs were measured by headspace gas chromatography from 5 min to 6 h postadministration. The areas under the blood concentration versus time curves (AUCs) of CHCl(3), BDCM, and DBCM were increased by a factor of 3.5, 1.6, and 2, respectively, by coadministration of TCA. DCA coadministration resulted in an increase in the AUC of DBCM (x2.5) and TBM (x1.3), whereas MCA modified the Cmax (x1.5) and AUC (x1.8) of BDCM and the AUC of DBCM (x2.5). In the second series of experiments, animals received either a single dose of 0.03125 mmol/kg of one of the four THMs, a mixture containing 0.03125 mmol/kg of each of the four THMs (total dose = 0.125 mmol/kg), or a mixture containing 0.03125 mmol/kg of each of the four THMs plus 0.125 mmol/kg of either TCA or DCA. Results indicated that the AUCs of CHCl(3), BDCM, DBCM, and TBM were increased during coadministration compared to single administrations (+2.5-fold). Combined administration of the four THMs with TCA, and not DCA, resulted in an increase of the AUCs of THMs (CHCl(3): x11.7; BDCM, DBCM, and TBM: x3.9) and an increase in the Cmax of CHCl(3) (x1.9). Overall, these results indicate that, at the dose levels tested in this study, TCA alters the blood concentration profiles of THMs.",

Male Wistar-rats were administered 408 mg/kg bromoform, 192 mg/kg chloroform, 86 mg/kg bromodichloromethane (BDCM), or 74 mg/kg dibromochloromethane (DBCM) orally. Selected rats were killed 6, 12, 24, or 48 hours after dosing and the livers were removed and assayed for metallothionein, delta-aminolevulinic-acid-synthetase (ALA), heme-oxygenase, and cytochrome-P-450 (P450). Other rats were given 204 mg/kg bromoform or 37 mg/kg DBCM daily for 7 days. They were killed 1 day after the last exposure and weighed. Their livers were analyzed for metallothionein, P450, ALA, and heme-oxygenase. Following single dosing, hepatic metallothionein concentrations were significantly increased 6 and 12 hours after exposure to chloroform and bromoform and 12 hours after exposure to BDCM and DBCM. The magnitude of the increases were larger after treatment with the more chlorinated compounds. ALA activity was significantly increased 12 and 24 hours after treatment with all compounds except at 12 hours after chloroform. ALA activity was still elevated 48 hours after exposure to bromoform and DBCM. All compounds significantly increased heme-oxygenase activity 6, 12, and 24 hours after dosing except for BDCM which had no effect at 6 hours. Heme-oxygenase activity was still elevated 48 hours after chloroform. Hepatic P450 content was significantly decreased by chloroform and bromoform, the effect of chloroform being greater. BDCM had no effect. DBCM caused slight decreases in P450 content at 12 and 24 hours. Seven days treatment with bromoform and DBCM did not significantly alter body or liver weight or hepatic metallothionein or P450 content or ALA or heme-oxygenase activity. The authors suggest that the effects of trihalomethanes on hepatic P450 content may reflect stimulation of processes involving heme degradation or inhibition of processes involving heme utilization.",

Male B6C3F1 mice were administered 0, 50, or 100 mg/kg tribromomethane on the same schedule. Body Weights and Survival in the Two-year Studies: Mean body weights of high dose male and female rats were 10%-28% lower than those of vehicle controls throughout the second year of the studies. Survival of the high dose group of male rats was significantly lower than that of the vehicle controls after week 91;no significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of female rats (male: vehicle control, 34/50;low dose, 30/50;high dose, 11/50;female: 34/50; 28/50; 28/50). Reduced survival for male rats given 200 mg/kg tribromomethane lowered the sensitivity of this group to detect a carcinogenic response. Mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control male mice were comparable throughout the study. Mean body weights of dosed female mice were 5%-16% lower than those of vehicle controls from week 28 to the end of the study. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of male mice; the survival of both dosed groups of female mice was significantly lower than that of the vehicle controls after week 77 (male: 41/50; 37/50; 36/50; female: 25/49; 15/50; 20/50). Reduced survival in all groups of female mice was partly due to a utero-ovarian infection; nonetheless, survival of all groups of female mice was at least 50%by week 92. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-year Studies: Uncommon adenomatous polyps or adenocarcinomas (combined) of the large intestine (colon or rectum) were induced in three male rats (vehicle control, 0/50; low dose, 0/50; high dose, 3/50) and in nine female rats (0/50; 1/50; 8/50); the historical incidence of neoplasms of the large intestine is less than 0.2% in approximately 2,000 corn oil vehicle control male F344/N rats, and none has been observed in approximately 2,000corn oil vehicle control female F344/N rats. Three of the neoplasms of the large intestine (one in the high dose male rats and two in the high dose female rats) were adenocarcinomas. Focal or diffuse fatty change of the liver was observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (male: 23/50; 49/50; 50/50; female: 19/50; 39/49; 46/50). Active chronic inflammation was observed at increased incidences in dosed male and high dose female rats (male: 0/50; 29/50; 23/50; female: 9/50; 8/49; 27/50). The incidence of necrosis of the liver was increased in high dose male rats (7/50; 3/50; 20/50)and decreased in dosed females (11/50; 3/49; 2/50). Mixed cell focus was observed at increased incidences in dosed female rats (8/50; 25/49; 28/50). Other nonneoplastic lesions observed at increased incidences in dosed rats included chronic active inflammation and squamous metaplasia of the ducts of the salivary gland (squamous metaplasia--male: 0/50; 15/50;31/48; female: 0/49; 10/49; 16/50; chronic active inflammation--male: 0/50; 16/50; 25/48; female: 0/49; 9/49; 18/50), squamous metaplasia of the prostate gland (2/49; 6/46; 12/50), ulcers of the forestomach (male: 1/49; 5/50; 10/50),and chronic active inflammation of the lung (male: 1/50;7/50; 15/50). Pigmentation of the spleen was also observed at an increased incidence in high dose female rats. The salivary gland and lung lesions were characteristic of infection by rat coronavirus, a virus to which a positive serologic reaction was observed early in the studies. The incidence of follicular cell hyperplasia of the thyroid gland was increased in high dose female mice (5/49; 4/49; 19/47), and fatty change of the liver was increased in both dosed groups of female mice (1/49; 9/50; 24/50). Nochemically related adverse effects were observed in male mice. Neoplastic lesions that occurred at lower incidences in dosed animals compared with those in vehicle controls included preputial gland neoplasms in male rats (10/41; 5/38; 1/34), uterine stromal polyps in female rats (10/49; 9/50; 2/50), anterior pituitary gland adenomas in male and female rats (male: 12/50; 12/48; 2/45; female: 29/48; 12/46; 16/48), mammary gland fibroadenomas in female rats (22/50; 17/50; 6/50), and alveolarhronchiolar neoplasms in male mice (11/50; 7/50; 2/49). Other than concomitant decreases in body weights, no other reasons are obvious to correlate these decreases with chemical administration. ... Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcirtogenic activity* of tribromomethane for male F344/N rats and clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for female F344/N rats, based on increased incidences of uncommon neoplasms of the large intestine. Reduced survival for male rats given 200 mg/kg tribromomethane lowered the sensitivity of this group to detect a carcinogenic response. Chemically related nonneoplastic lesions included fatty change and active chronic inflammation of the liver in male and female rats, minimal necrosis of the liver in male rats, and mixed cell foci of the liver in female rats. There was no evidence ofcarcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice given 50 or 100 mg/kg tribromomethane or for female B6C3F1 mice given 100 or 200 mg/kg; male mice might have been able to tolerate a higher dose. Survival of the female mice was reduced, partly due to a utero-ovarian infection.",

Tribromomethane induced trifluorothymidine (Tft) resistance in mouse L5178Y cells with and without metabolic activation. When tested in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for cytogenetic effects, tribromomethane produced an increase in both sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs)and chromosomal aberrations in the absence, but not in the presence, of exogenous metabolic activation. Tribromomethane caused sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila when administered to adult males by feeding; no induction of mutations was observed when tribromomethane was administered by abdominal injection. Results of tests for reciprocal translocations in adult male Drosophila exposed to tribromomethane by feeding were negative. In vivo test for cytogenetic effects in bone marrow cells of male B6C3F1 mice demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of tribromomethane induced an increase in SCEs but no increase in chromosomal aberrations. Intraperitoneal injection of tribromomethane also induced an increase in the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of B6C3F1 mice.",

Exposure produced an increase in an isoform of the regulatory subunit (RII) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, demonstrated by confocal microscopy and western blotting. Embryos showed an increase in RII where the primordial gill and ciliated velar epithelium are innervated. This increase correlated with increased ciliary activity, indicating a corresponding rise in the catalytic subunit. Treatment resulted in decreased threonine phosphorylation of actin. There was no effect on neurotransmitters or receptors of the serotonergic-dopaminergic nervous system. These effects occurred only with the ternary mixture. No significant effect was seen with individual or paired components. This is the first report showing that bromoform, chloroform, and tetrachloroethylene act synergistically to alter a key regulator of neuronal development.",

In a previous study, the authors' group has detected the presence of many brominated DBPs and identified five new aromatic brominated DBPs in chlorinated saline sewage effluents. The presence of brominated DBPs in chlorinated saline effluents may pose adverse implications for marine ecology. In this study, besides the detection and identification of another seven new aromatic halogenated DBPs in a chlorinated saline sewage effluent, their developmental toxicity was evaluated using the marine polychaete Platynereis dumerilii. For comparison, the developmental toxicity of some commonly known halogenated DBPs was also examined. The rank order of the developmental toxicity of 20 halogenated DBPs was 2,5-dibromohydroquinone > 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol >/= 2,4,6-triiodophenol > 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol >/= 4-bromophenol > 2,4-dibromophenol >/= 2,6-dibromo-4-nitrophenol > 2-bromo-4-chlorophenol > 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol > 2,4-dichlorophenol > 2,4,6-tribromophenol > 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde > bromoform >/= 2,4,6-trichlorophenol > 2,6-dibromophenol > 2,6-dichlorophenol > iodoacetic acid >/= tribromoacetic acid > bromoacetic acid > chloroacetic acid. On the basis of developmental toxicity data, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) was established. The QSAR involved two physical-chemical property descriptors (log P and pKa) and two electronic descriptors (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy and the highest occupied molecular orbital energy) to indicate the transport, biouptake, and biointeraction of these DBPs. It can well predict the developmental toxicity of most of the DBPs tested.",

Former uses as a solvent for waxes, greases and oils, in medicinal applications, fire extinguishers, and in the shipbuilding, aircraft and aerospace industries may have resulted in its release to the environment through various waste streams. Bromoform is also a by-product of water disinfection. Marine algae and sea kelp have been shown to produce bromoform and the compound has been reported in volcanic gas. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.40 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bromoform will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase bromoform will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 109 days. Bromoform does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, bromoform is expected to have high mobility based upon Koc values of 116 and 126. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.35X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Bromoform may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks, indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. However, bromoform is readily degraded in laboratory experiments under anaerobic conditions. If released into water, bromoform is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 7.1 days, respectively. BCF values of 19 and 21 suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on a hydrolysis half-life of 686 years. Occupational exposure to bromoform may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bromoform is produced or used, or where water disinfection takes place. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to bromoform via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of drinking water and food. (SRC)",

An experimentally-determined production rate for coralline algae (Corallinaceae) collected from the Sea of Japan is 83 ng/hour/g of algae (wet weight)(2). Bromoform is produced in polar brown, green, and red macroalgae at rates of 150, 32, and 45 picomole/g/day wet weight and in subtropic green and red macroalgae at rate of 102 picomole/g/day wet weight(3). Laboratory and in-situ measurements of bromoform production by giant kelp (M. Pyrifera) collected from the southern California coastal region ranged from 25-1,126 (median = 171) ng/day/g of fresh weight and 136-304 (median = 256) ng/day/g of fresh weight, respectively(6). Bromoform was detected in fumaroles and lava gas at Mt Etna, Italy, sampled in March 1998(7).",

According to a classification scheme(6), measured BCF values of 19 and 21(7) suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks(7) indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).

The experiments were conducted in continuous flow columns intended to simulate groundwater environments(1-2). The columns were seeded with mixed cultures of bacteria; acetate was used as the primary substrate(1-2). Approximately 20% of the initial concentration of 57 ug/L underwent biodegradation after 6.25 hours; approximately 30% biodegraded after 25 hours(1). Greater than 99% of the initial concentration of 18 ug/L was removed under methanogenic, denitrification and sulfate reducing conditions after 2.5 days(2). Greater than 99% reduction of bromoform, initially present at 132-177 ug/L was observed after 1.5 hours in a continuous flow column that was seeded with primary settled sewage; the above removal rate was attained approximately 1 year after operation of the column began(3). Anaerobic rate constants for bromoform were measured at 0.00096-0.0062/day in stream water(4). Under denitrifying conditions, a 60 ug/L solution of bromoform degraded to 59, 37, 35, and 2 ug/L after 2, 3, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on 117 samples collected in February 1984, the population-weighted estimates of the mean (median) concentration of bromoform in Los Angeles, CA drinking water were estimated as 0.78 (0.54) ug/L; based on 52 samples collected in May 1984: 8.08 (3.0) ug/L; based on 9 samples collected in February 1987: 3.2 (3.2) ug/L; based on 7 samples collected in February 1987: 25.5 (9.6) ug/L; the population-weighted mean (median) for Antioch-Pittsburgh, CA based on 71 samples collected in June 1984: 0.78 (0.58) ug/L(8). Bromoform was undetected in 25 home, 20 distribution, and 7 water treatment samples in Cobb county, Georgia and was detected at 8.7, 9.7, and 11.9 ppb in 25 home, 30 distribution, and 20 water treatment samples in Corpus Christy, Texas, respectively(9). Tap water samples taken in Phoenix, AZ contained 2.6 ug/L of bromoform(10). In 10 potable water samples bromoform was detected at 1.2-2.8 ug/L(11). Bromoform was not detected in 80 pretreatment drinking water samples and 26 of 80 post-treatment drinking water samples at <0.8-92 ug/L in facilities across the US(12). Bromoform was detected at <1 and 2-17 ug/L in 24 tap water samples from Cobb county, Georgia and Corpus Christi, Texas(13). Drinking water samples tested in 49 households throughout NJ had bromoform concentrations of 0.03-4.21 ug/L(14). Bromoform was not detected when using chlorine dioxide, chlorine, ozone, or chloramination treatments, however bromoform was detected when using chlorine dioxide with bromide at 0.46 ug/L, chlorine with bromide at 0.26 ug/L, ozone with bromide at 17 ug/L, and chloramination with bromide at 0.13 ug/L(15).",

The maximum concentration of bromoform detected in treated water samples collected on a monthly basis in 1994 from four locations in the distribution systems of three water treatment plants in Canada, each employing a different disinfection process, was 0.3 ug/L(3). Bromoform was not detected in raw water and at the at a water treatment plant in Barcelona, Spain, but was found in pre-chlorinated, sand filters, ozone, granulated carbon filter stage and post-chlorinated stages at 1.5-14, 15-31, 17-32, 13-20 and 15-27 ug/L, respectively(4). Bromoform was found to be 0-73.7% of the total trihalomethane concentrations in the drinking water network for Athens, Mytilene and Chalkida, Greece(5). Bromoform was detected in the Dnieper River basin, Ukraine at 0.01-0.02 ug/L(6). Bromoform was detected in 35 Finnish water works at concentrations of <0.05-27 ug/L in a study done from Jan to Oct 1994(7). Bromoform was detected in drinking water samples from the Sea of Galilee, Israel water treatment plants in May of 1999, September of 1999 and July of 2000(8). Bromoform was detected in 6 of 12 samples at concentrations of 0.5-21 ug/L in a 1996-1998 survey(9). Bromoform was detected in drinking water from Beijing, China at concentrations of 0-1.83 ug/L(10). In 21 public fountains in Torino, Italy, bromoform concentrations were detected at 0.17-1.78 ug/L and 0.06-1.03 ug/L in Dec 1994 and May 1995, respectively(11).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, an experimental vapor pressure of 5.25 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-chloro-1-propanol will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-chloro-1-propanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 days. If released to soil, 2-chloro-1-propanol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. The importance of biodegradation in soil and water is unknown. If released into water, 2-chloro-1-propanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 2-Chloro-1-propanol may slowly hydrolyze in basic waters with a half-life of approximately 140 days at pH 8. Occupational exposure to 2-chloro-1-propanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-chloro-1-propanol is produced or used. (SRC)",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 7 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). By analogy to 2,3-dichloro-1-propanol, which has a neutral first-order hydrolysis rate constant of 5.3X10-5 1/s and a base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 20.6 L/mole-hour(2), 2-chloro-1-propanol is expected to have a half-live of approximately 1.5 years at pH 7 and 140 days at pH 8(3,SRC). 2-Chloro-1-propanol is not expected to directly photolyze due to the lack of absorption in the environmental spectrum(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It sets up criteria for the classification of chemicals for physical-chemical, health, and environmental hazards of chemical substances and mixtures and sets up standardized hazard information to facilitate global trade of chemicals.  Please note that obsolete codes are added in this classification for completeness purposes, as they are still in use. Any obsolete codes are annotated as such.",

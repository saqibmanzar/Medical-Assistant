PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Carboxylic acids with six or fewer carbon atoms are freely or moderately soluble in water; those with more than six carbons are slightly soluble in water. Soluble carboxylic acids dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Many insoluble carboxylic acids react rapidly with aqueous solutions containing a chemical base and dissolve as the neutralization generates a soluble salt. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Insoluble carboxylic acids react with solutions of cyanides to cause the release of gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymerization reactions; like other acids, they often catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions.",

No oncogenic effect was reported. ...Ten/sex/group were sacrificed at 1 year. Doses reportedly based on a 14-day tolerance study and a 90-day subchronic. Better justification, however, is needed in that the LD50 is 4 g/kg and there is a lack of clinical observations at 200 mg/kg. The pilot studies suggest a higher dose should have been used. Also, no individual histopath, body weights, time to death, food consumption, other. No histopathology to confirm increased liver weight at 200 mg/kg so significance is questionable. The total number of males with benign tumors is statistically higher in the high dose group but the higher number (11/50) of males with lacrimal (Harderian) gland tumors compared with controls (6/86) contributes to this total. The significance of this tumor type to man is questionable because the gland is vestigial, unlike in rodents. The overall conclusion is that the test article is not oncogenic in this study.",

Dalapon is no longer registered for use in any products in the United States. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.19 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dalapon would exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dalapon is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 29 days. Dalapon absorbs light in the environmental portion of the UV spectrum, suggesting that direct photolysis may be an important environmental fate process; however, the rate of this potential reaction is not known. If released to soil, dalapon is expected to have very high mobility based upon Koc values of 1-2. The pKa of dalapon is 1.74, which indicates that this compound exists as an anion in water and moist soil surfaces. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces will not occur since anions do not volatilize. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on the estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation is expected to occur for dalapon at varying rates depending upon the conditions of the soil. The resultant average persistence of dalapon at recommended rates of application was reported to be two to four weeks in most agricultural soils during the growing season. If released into water, dalapon is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces will not occur since anions do not volatilize. Photolysis in sunlit surface waters may be an important fate process since dalapon absorbs light greater than 290 nm; however, the rate of this reaction is not known. Hydrolysis occurs slowly under environmental conditions with hydrolytic half-lives on the order of several months. The half-life of dalapon was 42 days when incubated in anaerobic river sediment, with complete degradation observed in about 70 days. A BCF value of 3 measure in fish suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The potential for occupational exposure and general population exposure may be low or non-existent since dalapon is no longer produced or used within the United States. (SRC)",

The pKa of dalapon is 1.74(3), which indicates that this compound will exist predominantly as an anion in moist soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces will not occur since anions do not volatilize(SRC). Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected to be an important environmental fate process(SRC) based on an estimated vapor pressure of 0.19 mm Hg determined from a fragment constant method(4). Biodegradation is expected to occur for dalapon at varying rates depending upon the conditions of the soil. The resultant average persistence of dalapon at recommended rates of application has been reported to be two to four weeks in most agricultural soils during the growing season(5). Under greenhouse conditions (28 \u00b0C), dalapon applied at a rate of 6 lbs/A persisted only 4-8 days in muck soil, 8-16 days in loam and silty loam soils, 16-32 days in sandy loam soil, and 32-64 days in silt clay soil(3). The half-life of dalapon in soil from Italy was reported as 30 days(6).",

The pKa of dalapon is 1.74(3), which indicates that this compound will exist primarily as an anion in water. Volatilization from water surfaces will not occur since anions do not volatilize(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), a BCF of 3 measured in fish(3), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process under environmental conditions since it has been concluded that dalapon and its salts have chemical hydrolytic half-lives of several months at temperatures less than 25 \u00b0C(3). Photolysis in sunlit surface waters may be possible since dalapon absorbs light greater than 290 nm(3); however, the rate of this potential reaction is not known in water. Dalapon has been shown to biodegrade in soils and sewage sludge under aerobic conditions(3), which suggests that it may also biodegrade in aerobic aquatic systems. The half-life of dalapon in anaerobic river sediment was 42 days, with complete degradation occurring at approximately 70 days(5).",

Vapor-phase dalapon is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 29 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.5X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). The UV absorption spectrum for dalapon shows absorbance in the range between 290 to 350 nm(4) which indicates that direct photolysis is possible, but the kinetics of this reaction are not known(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 29 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Based on a review of all available aqueous hydrolysis data, it has been concluded that dalapon and its salts have chemical hydrolytic half-lives of several months at temperatures less than 25 \u00b0C with hydrolysis leading to the formation of pyruvic acid(2). Dalapon sodium salt was hydrolyzed slowly at 25 \u00b0C in dilute and concentrated solution(2). At 50 \u00b0C hydrolysis was more rapid with approximately 25% hydrolysis in 8 days(2). The UV absorption spectrum for dalapon shows absorbance in the range between 290 to 350 nm(2) which indicates that direct photolysis is possible, but the kinetics of this reaction are not known(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Very little adsorption was observed in 3 silty loam soils or a silty clay loam soil in soil column leaching tests, with increased mobility noted with the addition of sand and decreased mobility with the addition of manure(3). Virtually complete leaching was observed through an 8.5 inch soil column of Kawkawlin sandy loam(4). Moderate to rapid leaching has been reported for most Hawaiian soils developed from volcanic materials(5). Dalapon has been reported to leach readily in soil(6). The soil Koc of dalapon was reported as 1-2(7). According to a classification scheme(8), these data suggest that dalapon is expected to have very high mobility in soil(SRC).",

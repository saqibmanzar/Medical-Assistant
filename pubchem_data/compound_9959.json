For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

However, it presents a high risk of accidental human poisoning. Because of MFA great toxicity, it came into consideration at the start of World War II as a potential warfare agent. HUMAN STUDIES: Nausea and vomiting following ingestion of very small amounts. ANIMAL STUDIES: In most animals it is a convulsant poison and causes progressive depression of respiration. It blocks the enzyme aconitase, thereby inhibiting the TCA cycle. This poison is quick-acting and has no antidote.",

Toxicity tests were performed in rabbits, guinea-pigs, rats or mice and compared to the toxicity of methyl-fluoroacetate (MFA). The following 2-FFA esters were prepared: 2-chloroethyl-fluoroacetate (2-CFA); 2-fluoroethyl-chloroacetate (2-FCA); 2-fluoroethyl-acetate (2-FA); 2-chloroethyl-fluorothiolacetate; allyl-fluoroacetate (AFA); and phenyl-fluorothiolacetate (PFT). In a concentration of 0.31 mg/L 2-CFA killed 92 percent of the rabbits, guinea-pigs and rats, while 0.10mg/L killed 54 percent. 2-CFA was more toxic than MFA, but not as toxic as 2-FFA. The toxicity of 2-FCA was identical to the toxicity of 2-CFA. The subcutaneous median lethal dose (LD50) of PFT in mice was 80 mg/kg, about 10 percent the toxicity of MFA. The subcutaneous LD50 of 2-CFA was 17.5 mg/kg, less than the toxicity of MFA. By inhalation, AFA was nearly as toxic as MFA, in addition to having an irritant effect. The subcutaneous LD50 of AFA in mice was 6 mg/kg.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 31 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl fluoroacetate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl fluoroacetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 98 days. Methyl fluoroacetate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methyl fluoroacetate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl fluoroacetate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, methyl fluoroacetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process as indicated by base-catalyzed half-lives of 4 days and 10 hours at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to methyl fluoroacetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl fluoroacetate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population is not likely to be exposed to methyl fluoroacetate. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase methyl fluoroacetate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 98 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.6X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

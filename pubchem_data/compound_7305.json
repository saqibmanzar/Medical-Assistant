When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The relatively nontoxic C(+/-)P(+/-)-isomers disappear within a few minutes from the blood stream of all three species, whereas the levels of the highly toxic C(+/-)P(-)-isomers remain toxicologically relevant for periods of 50-100 min in three species of doses of 2-3 LD50. Elimination pathways were quantified using carbon-14 labeled soman stereoisomers. Whereas the C(+/-)P(+)-isomers are largely eliminated by way of enzymatic hydrolysis, the major elimination pathway for the C(+/-)P(-)-isomers is binding to various proteins, in competition with binding to target acetylcholinesterase. Intraspecies nonlinearity with dose in the toxicokinetics of the C(+/-)P(-)-isomers is related to heterogeneous reactivity of the binding sites. Interspecies nonlinearity is probably due to decreasing amounts of binding sites in the order rats greater than guinea pigs greater than primates, leading to increasing \"toxico-availability\" in the reversed order.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Brain damage is primarily caused by the intense seizure activity induced by these agents. Identifying the brain regions that respond most intensely to nerve agents, in terms of generating and spreading seizure activity, along with knowledge of the physiology and biochemistry of these regions, can facilitate the development of pharmacological treatments that will effectively control seizures even if administered when seizures are well underway. Here, /investigators/ contrast the pathological (neuronal damage) and pathophysiological (neuronal activity) findings of responses to nerve agents in the amygdala and the hippocampus, the two brain structures that play a central role in the generation and spread of seizures. The evidence so far suggests that exposure to nerve agents causes significantly more damage in the amygdala than in the hippocampus. Furthermore, in in vitro brain slices, the amygdala generates prolonged, seizure-like neuronal discharges in response to the nerve agent soman, at a time when the hippocampus generates only interictal-like activity. In vivo experiments are now required to confirm the primary role that the amygdala seems to play in nerve agent-induced seizure generation.",

Studies in rats have shown that OP interfere with microtubule polymerization. Since microtubules are required for transport of nutrients from the nerve cell body to the nerve synapse, it has been suggested that disruption of microtubule function could explain the learning and memory deficits associated with OP exposure. Tubulin is a major constituent of microtubules. /Investigators/ tested the hypothesis that OP bind to tubulin by treating purified bovine tubulin with sarin, soman, chlorpyrifos oxon, diisopropylfluorophosphate, and 10-fluoroethoxyphosphinyl-N-biotinamidopentyldecanamide (FP-biotin). Tryptic peptides were isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometry. It was found that OP bound to tyrosine 83 of alpha tubulin in peptide TGTYR, tyrosine 59 in beta tubulin peptide YVPR, tyrosine 281 in beta tubulin peptide GSQQYR, and tyrosine 159 in beta tubulin peptide EEYPDR. The OP reactive tyrosines are located either near the GTP binding site or within loops that interact laterally with protofilaments. It is concluded that OP bind covalently to tubulin, and that this binding could explain cognitive impairment associated with OP exposure.",

The inhibited enzyme can undergo an aging process, during which the X-R moiety is dealkylated by breaking either the P-X or the X-R bond depending on the specific compound, leading to a nonreactivatable enzyme. Aging mechanisms have been studied primarily using AChE. However, some recent studies have indicated that organophosphate-inhibited butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) may age through an alternative pathway. /This/ work utilized matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to study the aging mechanism of human BChE inhibited by dichlorvos, echothiophate, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), isomalathion, soman, sarin, cyclohexyl sarin, VX, and VR. Inhibited BChE was aged in the presence of H2(18)O to allow incorporation of (18)O, if cleavage was at the P-X bond. Tryptic-peptide organophosphate conjugates were identified through peptide mass mapping. /The/ results showed no aging of VX- and VR-treated BChE at 25 degrees C, pH 7.0. However, BChE inhibited by dichlorvos, echothiophate, DFP, soman, sarin, and cyclohexyl sarin aged exclusively through O-C bond cleavage, i.e., the classical X-R scission pathway. In contrast, isomalathion aged through both X-R and P-X pathways; the main aged product resulted from P-S bond cleavage and a minor product resulted from O-C and/or S-C bond cleavage.",

The rate of spontaneous reactivation of AChE is variable, which partly accounts for differences in acute toxicity between the nerve agents. With soman in particular, an additional reaction occurs known as 'aging'. This consists of monodealkylation of the dialkylphosphonyl enzyme, which is then resistant to spontaneous hydrolysis and reactivation by oximes. Monodealkylation occurs to some extent with all dialkylphosphonylated AChE complexes; however, in general, is only of clinical importance in relation to the treatment of soman poisoning, where it is a very serious problem. With soman, aging occurs so fast that no clinically relevant spontaneous reactivation of AChE occurs before aging has taken place. Hence, recovery of function depends on resynthesis of AChE. As a result, it is important that an oxime is administered as soon after soman exposure as possible so that some reactivation of AChE occurs before all the enzyme becomes aged. Even though aging occurs more slowly and reactivation occurs relatively rapidly in the case of nerve agents other than soman, early oxime administration is still clinically important in patients poisoned with these agents.",

Nerve agents are part of a class known as organophosphorus compounds, and were first synthesized in 1854, but their development as warfare agents did not occur until 80 years later. The first military nerve agent, ethyl phosphorodimethylamidocyanidate, known as tabun, or chemical agent symbol GA, was synthesized in 1936 by Schrader while searching for more effective agricultural organophosphorate insecticides at the German chemical firm of IG Farbenindustrie. Two years later, he synthesized a second nerve agent, isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate, now known as Sarin or GB. In 1944, a third nerve agent, pinacolyl methylphosphonofuoridate, now known as Soman or GD, was synthesized.",

OPC adducts of butyrylcholinesterase and albumin are considered to be valuable biomarkers for retrospective verification of OPC exposure. Therefore, /the authors/ have detected and identified novel adducts of human serum albumin (HSA) by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Pure albumin and plasma were incubated with numerous pesticides and NA of the V- and G-type in different molar ratios. Samples were prepared either by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by in-gel enzymatic cleavage using endoproteinase Glu-C (Glu-C) or by combining highly albumin-selective affinity extraction with ultrafiltration followed by reduction, carbamidomethylation, and enzymatic cleavage (Glu-C) prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Characteristic mass shifts for phosphylation revealed tyrosine adducts at Y(411) (Y(401)KFQNALLVRY(411)TKKVPQVSTPTLVE(425)), Y(148) and Y(150) (I(142)ARRHPY(148)FY(150)APE(153), single and double labeled), and Y(161) (L(154)LFFAKRY(161)KAAFTE(167)) produced by original NA (tabun, sarin, soman, cyclosarin, VX, Chinese VX, and Russian VX) as well as by chlorpyrifos-oxon, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), paraoxon-ethyl (POE), and profenofos. MALDI-MS/MS of the single-labeled (142)I-E(153) peptide demonstrated that Y(150) was phosphylated with preference to Y(148). Aged albumin adducts were not detected. The procedure described was reproducible and feasible for detection of adducts at the most reactive Y(411)-residue (S/N  > or =3) when at least 1% of total albumin was labeled. This was achieved by incubating plasma with molar HSA/OPC ratios ranging from approximately 1:0.03 (all G-type NA, DFP, and POE) to 1:3 (V-type NA, profenofos). Relative signal intensity of the Y(411) adduct correlated well with the spotted relative molar amount underlining the usefulness for quantitative adduct determination. In conclusion, the current analytical design exhibits potential as a verification tool for high-dose exposure.",

In a comparative study, RBC-AChE and serum BChE activities in whole blood was obtained from forty seven healthy male and female human volunteers, and then exposed separately ex vivo to three OP nerve agents (soman (GD), sarin (GB) and VX) to generate a wide range of inhibition of AChE and BChE activity (up to 90% of control). These samples were measured using four different ChE assays: (i) colorimetric microEllman (using DTNB at 412 nm), (ii) Test-mate ChE field kit (also based on the Ellman assay), (iii) Michel (delta pH), and (iv) the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Whole Blood (WRAIR WB) cholinesterase assay. The WRAIR assay is a modified Ellman method using DTP at 324 nm (which minimizes hemoglobin interference and improves sensitivity), and determines AChE and BChE in a small whole blood sample simultaneously. Scatter plots of RBC-AChE activities were determined using the WRAIR ChE assay versus the micro-Ellman, Test-mate and Michel after exposure to varying concentrations of soman, sarin and VX. Regression analyses yielded mostly linear relationships with high correlations (r2 = 0.83-0.93) for RBC-AChE values in the WRAIR assay compared to the alternate methods. For the plasma BChE measurements, individual human values were significantly more variable (as expected), resulting in lower correlations using WRAIR ChE versus the alternate assays (r2 values 0.5 - 0.6). To circumvent the limitations of simple correlation analysis, Bland and Altman analysis for comparing two independent measurement techniques was performed. For example, a Bland and Altman plot of the ratio of the WRAIR whole blood AChE and Michel AChE (plotted on the y-axis) vs. the average of the two methods (x-axis) shows that the majority of the individual AChE values are within +/- 1.96 S.D. of the mean difference, indicating that the two methods may be used interchangeably with a high degree of confidence. The WRAIR ChE assay can be thus be used as a reliable inter-conversion assay when comparing results from laboratory-based (Michel) and field-based (Test-mate ChE kit), which use different methodology and report in different units of AChE activity.",

These adducts may offer relatively long-lived biological markers of nerve agent exposure that do not 'age' rapidly, and which are not degraded by therapy with oximes. Sensitive methods for the detection of these adducts have been developed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Adducts of all four nerve agents were detected in the blood of exposed guinea pigs being used in studies to improve medical countermeasures. The tyrosine adducts with soman and tabun were detected in guinea pigs receiving therapy 7 days following subcutaneous administration of five times the LD(50) dose of the respective nerve agent. VX also forms a tyrosine adduct in human blood in vitro but only at high concentrations.",

The capacity to assess the binding or hydrolysis of each of the four stereoisomers is an important tool in the development of enzymes with the potential to protect against GD intoxication. Using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based approach, we have examined the capacity of plasma-derived human serum albumin, plasma-purified human butyrylcholinesterase, goat milk-derived recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase, and recombinant human paraoxonase 1 to interact with each of the four stereoisomers of GD in vitro at pH 7.4 and 25 degrees C. Under these experimental conditions, the butyrylcholinesterase samples were found to bind GD with a relative preference for the more toxic stereoisomers (C-P- > C+P- > C-P+ > C+P+), while human serum albumin and paraoxonase 1 interacted with GD with a relative preference for the less toxic isomers (C-P+/C+P+ > C+P-/C-P-). The results indicate that these human proteins exhibit distinct stereoselective interactions with GD. The approach described presents a means to rapidly assess substrate stereospecificity, supporting future efforts to develop more effective OP bioscavenger proteins.",

AEGLs are used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures.  AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Rapid rescue from the hot zone represents the most practical and effective operational approach and in most major releases the most effective health response is likely to be focused in the more lightly contaminated (\"warm\") and uncontaminated (\"cold\") zones.

Two approaches to decontamination are feasible: the \"bucket and sponge\" method taking one patient at a time, or the mass decontamination approach with attendants supervising the passage of a queue of people through some communal shower unit. Patients who have been injured or are unable to help themselves should be decontaminated by trained attendants using a system in which a stretcher is placed on a table equipped with rollers that allows transfer of the decontaminated patient to a clean stretcher, and ambulance and to hospital. Some authorities have argued for the addition of liquid soap to the water used in automated decontamination units. This will speed the process of material but the interaction of water and soap leading to foaming when passed through a jet should be considered. Whatever means of decontamination are used it should be thorough. This means that each patient will need some minutes of attention: up to 15 or so minutes may be needed to deal with an incapacitated patient. Whatever system is used, plans for dealing with waste water and any decontaminants used should be devised and practiced in advance of an incident occurring. Waste water may be collected inside an area protected by inflatable \"bunds\". ...If waste water is to be allowed to run into drains, the local water company should be informed. ...Suitable towels and clothing must be provided, modesty should be preserved and consideration given to how people are to make their way home. /Chemical warfare agents/",

National Academies Press, Washington, DC. The U.S. ARMY is under a congressional mandate and the Chemical Weapons Convention of January 1993 to destroy its entire stockpile of chemical munitions. To ensure that chemical contamination is reduced to safe concentrations at stockpile and NSCM sites before they are used for residential, occupational, or wildlife purposes, the U.S. Army requested that health-based exposure limits for GA, GB, GD, VX, sulfur mustard, and lewisite be developed to protect the public and the environment. The National Research Council subcommittee determined that the Army's interim RfDs for GA, GB, GD, and sulfur mustard were scientifically valid but concluded that the RfDs for VX and lewisite and the SF for sulfur mustard were too high. The bases for those conclusions are described in this report.[Available from, as of July 3, 2007: http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=9644]",

In the present study, long-term effects of soman poisoning on learning ability, memory and neurogenesis were investigated in rats, treated with the anticholinergic atropine and the oxime HI-6 for reactivation of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase. /The authors/ also investigated whether sub-chronic treatment with the reported neurogenesis enhancer olanzapine would stimulate neurogenesis and possibly normalize the anticipated long-term deleterious effects of soman intoxication. Animals were treated with HI-6 (125 mg/kg i.p.), followed after 30 min by soman (200 ug/kg s.c.) and atropine sulphate (16 mg/kg i.m.) 1 min thereafter. Soman poisoning led to an elevation of extracellular acetylcholine levels to 1500% over baseline values as assessed by striatal microdialysis. Brain acetylcholinesterase was inhibited over 95%. This was accompanied by short recurrent seizures lasting for 40 min. Osmotic minipumps releasing olanzapine (7.5 mg/kg/day) or vehicle were subcutaneously implanted 24 hr post-intoxication. After drug delivery for 4 weeks, newborn cells were BrdU labeled. Learning and memory performance were assessed 8 weeks after soman poisoning, followed by analysis of surviving newborn cells (BrdU) and neurogenesis (doublecortin, DCX). Eight weeks after soman-intoxication a significantly impaired learning ability was found that was paralleled by significantly lower numbers of DCX-positive cells but no changes in the number of BrdU-labeled cells. Apparently, the present Olanzapine regime was ineffective. /The authors/ conclude that soman poisoning has long lasting effects on learning ability, a finding that was accompanied by impaired neurogenesis. /They/ confirm a correlation between impaired neurogenesis and cognitive deficits...",

The complexity, delayed onset, and persistent nature of nerve agent induced CNS effects need to be elucidated to block their multiple effects. In the present study gene expression and phosphoprotein profile of certain key neuronal proteins were studied after soman exposure. Quantitative real time PCR analysis of c-Fos, Bax, CREB and caspase 3 genes in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum showed that only c-Fos and Bax mRNA expression was increased significantly. Western blot analysis also confirmed the induction of c-Fos at early time points both at 0.5 and 1.0 LD(50) dose of soman exposure. Acute soman exposure caused perturbations in the phosphorylation status of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, CREB, c-Jun and NF-?B in all the three brain regions. The primary target for soman toxicity, AChE was inhibited in blood and brain up to 90%. Therapeutic treatment comprising of HI-6, atropine and diazepam has completely protected animals from death and reactivated soman inhibited AChE up to 40% in the plasma and RBC. This therapeutic regime also reduced soman induced Bax expression to near control levels, but could not reverse the soman induced changes in c-Fos expression and phosphorylation levels completely. Results suggest that exposure to soman caused persistent changes in these key brain proteins, which could lead to the development of complex neurotoxic effects and there is an urgent need for development of better drugs to stop multiple effects of nerve agents poisoning.",

Animals instrumented for electroencephalogram recording were pretreated with pyridostigmine bromide (0.026 mg/kg im) 30 min before challenge with 2 x LD50 (s.c.) of a nerve agent. In model A, atropine sulfate (2.0 mg/kg im) and pyridine-2-aldoxime methylchloride (2-PAM; 25.0 mg/kg im) were given 1 min after nerve agent challenge, and the tested anticonvulsant was given (im) 5 min after seizure onset. In model B, a lower dose of atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg im) was given along with 2-PAM 1 min after nerve agent challenge, and the anticonvulsant was given at seizure onset. With the lower dose of atropine, seizure occurrence increased to virtually 100% for all agents; the time to seizure onset decreased for sarin, cyclosarin, and VX; the signs of nerve agent intoxication were more severe; and coma resulted frequently with cyclosarin. The anticonvulsant ED50 doses for scopolamine or diazepam were, in general, not different between the two models, whereas the anticonvulsant ED50 values of midazolam increased 3- to 17-fold with the lower atropine dose. Seizure termination times were not systematically affected by the different doses of atropine. The order of anticonvulsant effectiveness within each model was scopolamine > or = midazolam > diazepam. The findings indicate that the dose of atropine given as antidotal therapy can significantly influence measures of nerve agent toxicity and responsiveness to anticonvulsant therapy.",

This paper ... /focuses/ on the cytokine IL-1beta induction in the rat brain after soman-intoxication (1.0 x LD50 and 1.1 x LD50) and during antidote treatment. ... IL-1beta levels in rat brain /were analyzed/ to determine the effects of time of antidote HI 6 and atropine; the effects of different combinations of HI 6 and atropine; and also the effects of antidotes diazepam and atropine following soman-intoxication. ... The initiation of the antidote combination of HI 6 and atropine following soman-intoxication was crucial for successful treatment. The study also demonstrated that atropine alone was more effective against IL-1beta up-regulation after soman-intoxication within the 2-hr time frame, than the combination of the HI 6 and atropine, the therapy of choice in many countries. Furthermore, treatment with a combination of diazepam and atropine maintained IL-1beta levels at normal when administered at the onset of the seizures following soman exposure. Soman-intoxicated groups without seizures did not have an elevated cytokine level. ...",

Rescue and drug administration should be undertaken by trained staff that are protected by personal protective equipment and equipped with pressure demand, self contained breathing apparatus .... In addition, the use of small portable gas powered ventilators can assure a high quality of essential ventilatory care at the scene. The priority is to remove the casualty from further nerve agent exposure and to establish and maintain a clear airway; supplemental oxygen should be given as required. If possible, the victim's contaminated clothing should be removed to reduce further nerve agent absorption. ... Civilian casualties who have been exposed substantially to a nerve agent should receive antidotal treatment as soon as possible after exposure; the rapid parenteral administration of atropine to patients presenting with rhinorrhea and bronchorrhea may be life-saving. It is also recommended that casualties requiring atropine should also receive immediately whichever oxime is available. ... Severely intoxicated adult casualties may require the administration of the contents of three /autopen injections/ at 5-10 min intervals prior to admission to hospital. Casualties receiving antidotes should be moved to hospital as soon a possible. Casualties who do not develop the features of systemic toxicity, notably rhinorrhea and bronchorrhea, should be triaged but not given atropine or oxime. /Nerve agents/",

Endotracheal aerosolization by microinstillation was used to administer GD (280, 561, and 841 mg/cu m) or saline to anesthetized guinea pigs. Significant increases in respiratory frequency (RF), tidal volume (TV), and minute volume (MV) were observed with 841 mg/cu m GD at 4 hours and that were reduced at 24 hours postexposure. A dose-dependent increase in peak inspiration flow and peak expiration flow was present at 4-hour post-GD exposure that was reduced at 24 hours. Time of inspiration and expiration were decreased in all doses of GD exposure at 4 and 24 hours, with significant inhibition at 841 mg/cu m. End-expiratory pause (EEP) increased at 280 and 561 mg/cu m, but decreased in animals exposed 841 mg/cu m at 24 hours postexposure. Pseudo-lung resistance (Penh) and pause followed similar patterns and increased at 4 hours, but decreased at 24 hours postexposure to 841 mg/cu m of GD compared to control. These studies indicate GD exposure induces dose-dependent changes in pulmonary function that are significant at 841 mg/cu m at 4 hours and remains 24 hours postexposure. Furthermore, at 4 hours, GD induces bronchoconstriction possibly due to copious airway secretion and ongoing lung injury in addition to cholinergic effects, while at 24 hours GD induces bronchodilation a possible consequence of initial compensatory mechanisms.",

Male Hartley guinea pigs were exposed to 841 mg/cu m of GD or saline for 4 min. At 24 and 48 hr post GD exposure, respiratory dynamics and functions were monitored for 75 min after 1 hr of stabilization in a barometric whole-body plethysmograph. GD-exposed animals showed a significant increase in respiratory frequency (RF) at 24 hr postexposure compared to saline controls. The 24-hr tidal volume (TV) increased in GD-exposed animals during the last 45 min of the 75-min monitoring period in the barometric whole-body plethysmograph. Minute ventilation also increased significantly at 24 hr post GD exposure. The peak inspiratory flow (PIF) increased, whereas peak expiratory flow (PEF) decreased at 24 hr and was erratic following GD exposure. Animals exposed to GD showed a significant decrease in expiratory (Te) and inspiratory time (Ti). Although end inspiratory pause (EIP) and end expiratory pause (EEP) were both decreased 24 hr post GD exposure, EEP was more evident. Pause (P) decreased equally during the 75-min recording in GD-exposed animals, whereas the pseudo lung resistance (Penh) decreased initially during the monitoring period but was near control levels at the end of the 75-min period. The 48-hr respiratory dynamics and function parameter were lower than 24 post GD exposures. These results indicate that inhalation exposure to soman in guinea pigs alters respiratory dynamics and function at 24 and 48 hr postexposure.",

Since these neurotransmitters play a key-role in the auditory function, it was hypothesized that a hearing test may be an efficient way for detecting the central effects of soman intoxication. In the present study, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), a non-invasive audiometric method, were used in rats administered with soman (70 ug/kg). Four hours post-soman, DPOAE intensities were significantly decreased. They returned to baseline one day later. The amplitude of the temporary drop of the DPOAEs was well related to the severity of the intoxication. The greatest change was recorded in the rats that survived long-lasting convulsions, i.e. those that showed the highest ChE inhibition in brain and severe encephalopathy. Furthermore, the administration, immediately after soman, of a three-drug therapy composed of atropine sulfate, HI-6 and avizafone abolished the convulsions, the transient drop of DPOAEs at 4hr and the occurrence of SRBD at 28 hr without modifying brain ChE inhibition. This showed that DPOAE change was not directly related to soman-induced inhibition of cerebral ChE but rather to its neuropathological consequences. The present findings strongly suggest that DPOAEs represent a promising non-invasive tool to predict SRBD occurrence in nerve agent poisoning and to control the efficacy of a neuroprotective treatment.",

African green monkeys (Chlorocebus sabeus) (n = 8) were exposed for 10 min, whole-body, to a single concentration of soman (0.028-0.891 mg/cu m). EC50 values for miosis were determined to be 0.055 mg/cu m and 0.132 mg/cu m when defined as a 50 percent reduction in pupil area and diameter, respectively. In general, performance on a serial probe recognition task remained unchanged at lower concentrations, but responding was suppressed at the largest concentration tested. Soman produced concentration-dependent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity and, to a lesser extent, butyrylcholinesterase activity. These results characterize threshold soman exposure concentrations that produce miosis in the absence of other overt signs of toxicity and extend previous studies indicating that miosis is a valuable early indicator for the detection of soman vapor exposure.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.41 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates soman will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase soman will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hours. The UV absorption spectrum of soman in cyclohexane solution exhibits little to no absorption above 290 nm; therefore, direct photolysis by sunlight in the environment is not expected to be an important fate process. Soman vapor has been observed to react with water vapor, probably through hydrolysis, suggesting that reaction of soman vapor with water vapor may be an important fate process in the atmosphere. If released to soil, soman is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 103. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.7X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Soman has been observed to volatilize from both wet and dry surfaces. Simulated rainfall events have shown that soman adsorbed to soil can desorb resulting in volatilization (off-gassing) to the atmosphere. Soman decomposes in soil via hydrolysis and is most stable in the medium pH range from 4 to 6. Soman has a hydrolysis half-life of about 60 hours at pH 6 and 25 \u00b0C in water; extrapolation of hydrolysis rates to moist soil must be used with caution as susceptibility to hydrolysis in soil depends upon a variety of factors. However, hydrolysis is expected to be an important fate process in soil. The persistence of soman in soil may be expected for days-to-months depending upon soil type and conditions. Several species of bacteria, such as Alteromonas sp. and Flavobacterium sp., are capable of degrading G-type nerve agents, however data are not available to assess the environmental importance of soman biodegradation. If released into water, soman is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 11 and 82 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Soman hydrolyzes in water at neutral or slightly acid pH and more rapidly under strong acid or alkaline conditions. The half-life of soman in water at pH 7, 20 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C has been reported as 82 and 22 hours, respectively; the half-life of soman in water at pH 7.6, 20 and 30 \u00b0C has been reported as 41 and 9.6 hours, respectively. Occupational exposure to soman may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where soman is produced or used. Exposure to soman occurs through vapor contact which is readily absorbable through not only the lungs and eyes but also the skin and intestinal tract. The general population will not be exposed to soman unless it is used as a weapon; exposure to soman, if used as a weapon, will be via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact. (SRC)",

Soil sorption studies using different soil types noted that soman applied to the surface can adsorb to soil with increasing resistance to desorption in the absence of sufficient moisture and water(4); simulated rainfall events were shown to desorb the soman resulting in volatilization to the atmosphere(4). Volatilization of soman from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.7X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.41 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 2.1X10+4 mg/L(6). Soman has been observed to volatilize from both wet and dry surfaces(7,8). Soman has an aqueous hydrolysis half-life of about 60 hours at pH 6 and 25 \u00b0C(7). Soman decomposes in soil via hydrolysis and is most stable in the medium pH range from 4 to 6 and is self-buffering in that range(9). Extrapolation of aqueous hydrolysis rates to soil must be used with caution(4); susceptibility to hydrolysis on soil surfaces can depend upon dissemination method to the soil, soil properties, degree of adsorption, organic matter content, pH, and moisture content(4). However, hydrolysis is expected to be an important fate process in soil(4). The persistence of soman on soil under different weather conditions was found as follows(10): 15 \u00b0C, sunshine and a slight wind, soman persisted in soil 2.5 to 5 days; at 10 \u00b0C, rainfall and foul weather, soman persisted in soil 3 to 36 hours; at -10 \u00b0C, sunshine and calm on snow, soman persisted in soil 1 to 6 weeks(10). Another soil study found that the persistence of soman in soil may be expected for days-to-months timeframe depending upon soil type(4). Several species of bacteria, such as Alteromonas sp. and Flavobacterium sp. are capable of degrading G-type nerve agents(7), but data are not available to assess the environmental importance of biodegradation(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.7X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.41 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 2.1X10+4 mg/l(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 11 and 82 days, respectively(SRC). Soman hydrolyzes in water at neutral or slightly acid pH and more rapidly under strong acid or alkaline conditions(7). The half-life of soman in water at pH 7, 20 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C has been reported as 82 and 22 hours, respectively; the half-life of soman in water at pH 7.6, 20 and 30 \u00b0C has been reported as 41 and 9.6 hours, respectively(8). According to a classification scheme(9), an estimated BCF of 7(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC,2013).",

Vapor-phase soman is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). The UV absorption spectrum of soman in cyclohexane solution exhibits little to no absorption above 290 nm(4); therefore, direct photolysis by sunlight in the environment is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). Soman vapor pressure studies attempting to incorporate ambient humidity found that soman vapor reacted with water vapor probably through hydrolysis(5); therefore, reaction of soman vapor with water vapor may be an important fate process in the atmosphere(SRC).",

Pseudomonas melophthora and Pseudomonas testosteroni were found capable of degrading O-pinacolyl hydrogen methylphosphonate, a primary metabolite of soman. Generally, few microorganisms found in soil can break down the C-P bond in soman. The biodegradation process is assumed to be promoted by warm soil temperatures, adequate moisture and the presence of organic matter(2). The enzymes parathion hydrolase, squid hepatopancreas, and Alteromonas sp. JD6.5 were found to have specific activity for soman at 5, 60 and 600 umol/min/mg, respectively, conditions unknown(3). Soman can be biotransformed via O-dealkylation and C-dealkylation; however, the final products would remain toxic(4). Several species of bacteria, such as Alteromonas sp. and Flavobacterium sp. are capable of degrading G-type nerve agents(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 8 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The UV absorption spectrum of soman in cyclohexane solution exhibits little to no absorption above 290 nm(2); therefore, direct photolysis by sunlight in the environment is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). Using a mercury vapor lamp that outputs wavelengths <290 nm, soman vapor was irradiated for two hours under both dry and wet air conditions(3); in dry air, the amount of soman degraded to pinacolyl methylphosphonic acid (PMPA) was 10 percent both with and without irradiation(3); in wet air, the amount of soman degraded to PMPA increased from 22-27 percent to 47-56 percent(3); no other degradation products were observed(3). It has been estimated that photophysical deactivation to the ground state of the soman molecule, with no net chemical degradation, generally accounts for more than 95 percent of light energy absorbed(4); thus, it was concluded that the potential for photolysis of soman after dissemination would be insignificant(4). Soman hydrolyzes in water at neutral or slightly acid pH and more rapidly under strong acid or alkaline conditions(5). Soman vapor pressure studies attempting to incorporate ambient humidity found that soman vapor reacted with water vapor, probably through hydrolysis, making measurement unsuccessful(6). Qualitatively, the aqueous hydrolysis of soman is similar to that of sarin, however, the reaction rate is about five times slower than sarin(7); the half-life of soman is about 60 hours at pH 6 and 25 \u00b0C(7).",

Soman has an estimated hydrolysis half-life of about 60 hours at pH 6 and 25 \u00b0C. The hydrolysis reaction is both acid and base catalyzed. Copper(II) complexes have been found to catalyze soman hydrolysis; imidazole, acting as a nucleophilic catalyst, can accelerate soman hydrolysis by as much as three orders of magnitude(1). Soman decomposes in soil via hydrolysis and is most stable in the medium pH range from 4 to 6 and is self-buffering in that range. Below pH 4, the hydrolysis is self-catalyzed due to the generation of hydrogen ions and phosphate ions(2). Soman in water at 100 mg/L and kept at 18 \u00b0C is said to require around 75 days for complete hydrolysis(3). The half-life of soman in water at pH 7, 20 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C has been reported as 82 and 22 hours, respectively; the half-life of soman in water at pH 7.6, 20 and 30 \u00b0C has been reported as 41 and 9.6 hours, respectively(3). At a pH >10, hydrolysis to PMPA occurs within a few minutes(4).",

The half-lives for the hydrolysis of soman in distilled water (initial pH = 4.5 to 5.0), isotonic saline (initial pH 5.0 to 5.2), dilute sulfuric acid (initial pH = 4.5), and acetate buffer (pH 4.5) solutions were determined to be 381, 396, 445 and 62 hours, respectively(2). After 24 hours, 38 percent of a 2 mg/mL solution of soman at 25 \u00b0C remained; after 24 hours, 92 percent of a 0.2 mg/mL solution of soman at 25 \u00b0C remained(3). The kinetics of the hydrolysis of soman was measured from 1 to 80X10-5 mole/L hydroxide-ion concentration. No apparent \"saturation effect\" could be positively identified. The second order rate coefficient for soman was 10M-1 s-1 at 25 \u00b0C(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Clay converted to a calcium form and dehydrated at 105 \u00b0C adsorbed 30.0 mg soman(4). At 2.0, 2.3, 3.0 and 9.1 percent moisture, soman sorption in the clay was 91.2, 94.4, 91.3, and 43.1 mg/g(4). If soman is sorbed while soil is wet, desorption occurs quickly; if the soil is dry for 2 or 3 days after uptake, desorption is much more difficult. An increase in soil temperature generally leads to a decrease in adsorption of soman(5). Soil sorption studies using different soil types noted that soman applied to the surface can adsorb to soil with increasing resistance to desorption in the absence of sufficient moisture and water(6); simulated rainfall events were shown to desorb the soman resulting in volatilization to the atmosphere(6).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that soman is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 11 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 82 days(SRC). Soman's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Laboratory and field tests have demonstrated that soman will evaporate from soil surfaces(4); soman evaporates at about one-fourth the rate of water(4). In a study where volatilization of alkyl methylphosphonates were estimated using models based upon surface deposition and contamination of bulk soil, it was determined that volatilization of soman may be substanital relative to its rate of hydrolysis(5). Using a surface deposition model, soman is expected to volatilize with a half-life of about 7.7 hours(6). Volatilization rates calculated using a bulk soil model were three orders of magnitude slower than those obtained using the surface deposition model(6). In cold environments, vaporization may be a controlling process. In a Norwegian study, soman was found to be removed from snow slowly, giving the appearance that volatilization was the cause of the loss of agent(5). After 48 days, soman was present in uncovered snow in concentrations less than 0.1 percent of 1 mg, and in covered snow in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 percent of 1 mg(7). Field and laboratory tests have shown that soman absorbed to soil can be volatilized to the atmosphere (off-gassed) via rain events(4,8); the degree of volatilization varies with soil type, moisture content and length of time adsorbed, but this volatilization is an important fate process(4,8).",

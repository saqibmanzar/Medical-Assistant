PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Concentrations of iodixanol in serum and urine were measured by means of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Fecal concentrations of iodixanol, based on iodine measurements, were determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. Serial radiographs were obtained and histopathological examination was performed on selected tissues. The results indicate that less than 1% of the intragastric dose of iodixanol is absorbed from the intestine into the blood stream. No adverse clinical signs were observed, and there were no treatment-related histomorphological findings.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Similar to iohexol, it can also be a good exogenous marker for the measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). /Investigators present/ the development and validation of an HPLC-UV method for quantification of iodixanol in human plasma. Internal standard, iohexol (20 uL, 1 mg/mL), and perchloric acid (30 uL, 20%, v/v) were added to plasma samples (300 uL), followed by neutralization with 10 uL potassium carbonate (5M). Samples were centrifuged and 10 uL of the supernatant was injected onto a C(18) EPS analytical column (3 um particle size, 150 mm x 4.6 mm). The extraction method yielded >95% recovery for both iodixanol and iohexol. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% (w/v) sodium formate buffer and acetonitrile. Iohexol and iodixanol peaks were eluted at approximately 5 and 9 min, respectively using a fast gradient method. The assay lower limit of detection was 2.0 ug/mL and lower limit of quantification was 10 ug/mL. The calibration curves, assessed in six replicates, were linear over an iodixanol concentration range of 10-750 ug/mL. Intra- and inter-day accuracy was >95% and precision expressed as % coefficient of variation was <10%. This method is simple, accurate, precise and robust and can potentially be used for iodixanol quantification in large-scale clinical studies.",

Local exhaust ventilation is generally preferred to general exhaust because it can control the contaminant at its source, preventing dispersion into the work area. An industrial hygiene survey involving air monitoring may be used to determine the effectiveness of engineering controls. Effectiveness of engineering controls intended for use with highly potent materials should be assessed by use of nontoxic surrogate materials. Local exhaust ventilation such as a laboratory fume hood or other vented enclosure is recommended, particularly for grinding, crushing, weighing, or other dust-generating procedures."

A 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease was admitted to the emergency department for recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Before combined percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and carotid artery stenting (CAS) using iodixanol, the patient suffered from concomitant unstable angina and recurrent transient ischemic attacks. The total amount of iodixanol used during the CAS procedure was 300 mL. Contrast-induced encephalopathy, which manifested as aphasia, stupor, and full hemiparesis immediately after the combined procedure, was diagnosed by urgent computed tomography. Treatment was based on anti-edema drugs, and the patient made a complete recovery within 48 hours, without any neurological sequelae. ...",

The animals received up to 4 injections in the cisterna cerebellomedullaris while under light anesthesia. Iotrolan was included as a reference study in 1 study. The observations comprised assessment of clinical behavior, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, hematology, clinical chemistry and/or macroscopic and microscopic examination at necropsy. In addition, the repeated-dose dog study, urinalysis and opthalmoscopy were performed, electrocardiograms obtained, and respiratory rate, blood pressure and rectal temperature measured. Clinical signs and minor pathological changes caused by the injection procedures were seen in all studies in some animals treated with iodixanol as well as in control animals. Single (2.0 g I/kg) and repeated (0.960 g I/kg) intracisternal administration of iodixanol to mice caused no significant toxicological effects. Two dogs treated with a high dose of iodixanol (0.256 g I/kg; 0.8 mL/kg) had pathological changes (meningeal inflammation and/or necrosis) that were more severe than those observed in control dogs. Single and repeated intracisternal administration of 0.128 g I/kg (0.4 mL/kg) of iodixanol to dogs, however, caused no significant toxicological effects. Apart from the findings in the 2 dogs, the neurological and neuropathological changes elicited by iodixanol were similar to those induced by control or reference substances. The results from these intracisternal toxcity studies in mice and dogs indicate a significant margin of safety regarding the use of iodixanol in clinical intra-thecal indications.",

No significant effect on serum creatinine levels was seen at doses up to and including 5 g I/kg in rats and 10.5 g I/kg in rabbits. An immediate and transient increase in proteinuria was found in rabbits when 10.5 g I/kg was administered as a bolus, and when 12.5 g I/kg was administered as a slow infusion in a comparative study with several CM. Increased serum elimination half-life was shown by measuring serum iodine concentrations after the infusion of 12.5 g I/kg. The effect of a high dose of iodixanol on proteinuria and elimination half-life were in this study in the same range as those of the monomeric nonionic CM, but less pronounced than those of the monomeric ionic CM. Reduced renal capacity was induced in male rats by performing unilateral nephrectomy 4 weeks before i.v. injection of iodixanol or iopamidol (2g I/kg). The administration of CM did not affect renal function monitored as serum concentrations of creatinine and urea. The vacuolation of renal proximal tubular cells and kidney iodine retention were investigated in rats 48 hours after administration of different doses of iodixanol or iotrolan. The no-effect level for vacuolation was 0.5 g I/kg for both CM. Iodine retention was higher in male than females rats, and was higher for iodixanol than iotrolan at the 2 highest dose levels (3 and 5 g I/kg). No difference in iodine retention was found at the other dose levels (0.25-1g I/kg). The reversibility of renal proximal tubular vacuolation after administration of iodixanol was studied in male rats (1.2 g I/kg) and monkeys (1.2 and 3.6 g I/kg). The vacuolation was more pronounced in rats than in monkeys. Vacuolation was completely reversed in all rats 3 weeks after dosing, and 2 of 3 monkeys 3 days after a dose of 1.2 g I/kg. The degree of vacuolation evident in renal percutaneous biopsy specimens from monkeys 14 days after i.v. administration of iodixanol at a dose of 3.5 g I/kg was not significantly different to that in control animals. In conclusion, iodixanol affected renal function to the same degree as did the nonionic monomeric and dimeric comparative media, but to a lesser degree than the ionic monomers. The degree of renal proximal tubular cell vacuolation induced by iodixanol seems to be species-dependent, being less pronounced and more quickly reversed in monkeys than rats.",

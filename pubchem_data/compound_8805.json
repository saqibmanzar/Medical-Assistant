When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A bioassay for the possible carcinogenicity of 4'-(chloroacetyl)-acetanilide was conducted using Fischer 344 rats and B6C3Fl mice. 4'-(Chloroacetyl)-acetanilide was admin in the feed, at either of two concn, to groups of 50 male and 50 female animals of each species. Twenty animals of each sex and species were placed on test as controls. The high and low dietary concn of 4'-(chloroacetyl)-acetanilide were, respectively, 2,000 and 1,000 ppm for rats and 10,000 and 5,000 ppm for mice. The cmpd was admin for 87 weeks of a 102 wk period in rats and for 90 wk of a 105 wk period in mice. Mice were /sacrificed/ at the end of the last wk of cmpd admin, while rats were observed for 1 wk after cmpd admin ceased. There were no significant positive associations between the concn of 4'-(chloroacetyl)-acetanilide admin and mortality in rats or mice of either sex. Adequate numbers of animals in all groups survived sufficiently long to be at risk from late developing tumors. ... Under the conditions of this bioassay, 4'-(chloroacetyl)-acetanilide was not carcinogenic when admin in the diet to Fischer 344 rats or B6C3Fl mice of either sex. ... Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: Male Rats: Negative; Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Negative; Female Mice: Negative.",

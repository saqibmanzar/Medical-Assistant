Uremic toxins can be subdivided into three major groups based upon their chemical and physical characteristics: 1) small, water-soluble, non-protein-bound compounds, such as urea; 2) small, lipid-soluble and/or protein-bound compounds, such as the phenols and 3) larger so-called middle-molecules, such as beta2-microglobulin. Chronic exposure of uremic toxins can lead to a number of conditions including renal damage, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. \nHeptanal is found in allspice. Heptanal is found in essential oils of ylang-ylang, clary sage, California orange, bitter orange and others. Heptanal is a flavouring agent Heptanal or heptanaldehyde is an alkyl aldehyde with a strong fruity odor which is used as an ingredient in cosmetics, perfumes, and flavors. It can be obtained from castor oil by distillation under reduced pressure. Industrially, it is used in the manufacture of 1-heptanol and ethyl heptanoate. Heptanal belongs to the family of Medium-chain Aldehydes. These are An aldehyde with a chain length containing between 6 and 12 carbon atoms.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Increased levels of uremic toxins can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species. This seems to be mediated by the direct binding or inhibition by uremic toxins of the enzyme NADPH oxidase (especially NOX4 which is abundant in the kidneys and heart) (A7868). Reactive oxygen species can induce several different DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which are involved in the silencing of a protein known as KLOTHO.  KLOTHO has been identified as having important roles in anti-aging, mineral metabolism, and vitamin D metabolism. A number of studies have indicated that KLOTHO mRNA and protein levels are reduced during acute or chronic kidney diseases in response to high local levels of reactive oxygen species (A7869). ",

The skin of half the animals was abraded prior to the first, sixth, and eighth dose. A control group was treated with mineral oil only. Viability was recorded twice daily, observations for skin irritation were made daily, and body weights were measured weekly. After 2 weeks 6 animals (3 with abraded and 3 with intact skin) were necropsied with the remaining 4 animals sacrificed after an additional 2-week recovery period. Tissues from 29 organs were removed and preserved in 10% formalin. No mortalities were observed at weeks 2 and 4. Most animals exhibited a weight loss after one or two weeks, but animals held for an additional two week recovery period exhibited normal weight gain compared to controls. Most animals showed local dermal irritation reflected by slight to moderate erythema during the first week. Localized necrosis and exfoliation occurred in most animals during the second week. Microscopic evaluation revealed epidermal necrosis, epidermal hyperplasia, and hyperkeratosis at the application site. the skin application sites of animals held to week 4 appeared healed.

Ten females were used in the study. ... Body weights were measured daily and the difference in weight between the weight on the day of insemination and immediately after parturition were also recorded. There was no reported of resorptions in any of the 10 female rats. Oral administration of 2050 mg/kg/bw/day of heptanal resulted in no evidence of reproductive toxicity in female Wistar rats. Study contained measurement of limited number of parameters measuring reproduction. Oral study was a preliminary study in Wistar rats.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.52 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-heptanal will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-heptanal will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 hrs. n-Heptanal contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, n-heptanal is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 86. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. n-Heptanal may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A theoretical BOD of 14.7% in 1 day using an activated sludge indicates that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, n-heptanal is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. In a groundwater recharge project in Palo Alto, CA, 70% of theoretical COD of n-heptanal was removed, indicating that n-heptanal will biodegrade in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 hrs and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to n-heptanal may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-heptanal is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-heptanal via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with products containing n-heptanal.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 hrs and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 11(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). In a groundwater recharge project, CA, 70% of theoretical COD of n-heptanal was removed(6), indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). n-Heptanal is easily oxidized(7) and may be oxidized by oxygen and other oxidants present in natural water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase n-heptanal is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). n-Heptanal contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The oxidation is so facile that atmospheric oxygen will result in contamination with the corresponding carboxylic acid during storage(1). Transition metal salts catalyze n-heptanal's oxidation(2). The autooxidation may be thermally- or photochemically-initiated(3). The initial oxidation is a free radical chain reaction producing a peroxycarboxylic acid, which then reacts with another aldehyde molecule to yield two carboxylic acid molecules as a final product(1,3). The ease of oxidation of aldehydes is due, in part, to the high reactivity of the peroxy radicals formed in this reaction(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The site was subject to anthropogenic influences. n-Heptanal was also found in seawater in Vinyard Sound, MA, 2.5-61 ng/L with a mean of 13 ng/L(2,3) and in coastal water off of Peru(4). At the former site, the levels rose from a few ng/L found year round to about 20 ng/L in winter as the chlorophyll A levels peaked(3). At the latter site, the concentration of n-heptanal declined markedly with depth(4). A cluster analysis suggests that sources and sinks of n-heptanal are complex(2). n-Heptanal was detected, but not quantified in the Glatt River, Switzerland(5).",

In all cases, C7 aldehydes (isomers not identified), were present within 27 hours after ozone (50 ppb) was introduced into the chamber. They where absent before the ozone was introduced. The concentration of C7 aldehydes at this time was 1.4-3.2 ppb. It was suggested that aldehydes were produced by a reaction of a fiber component and ozone. Low concentrations of C7 aldehydes often persisted after ozone was eliminated indicating that the carpet had adsorbed some of the previously-produced aldehyde and was slowly releasing it. The ozone concentrations in the chamber, 28-44 ppb, may be present in indoor air during photochemical smog episodes(1). /C7 Aldehydes/",

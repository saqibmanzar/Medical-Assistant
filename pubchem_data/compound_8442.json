When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Groups of 50 rats of each sex were administered piperonyl sulfoxide in the diet at one of several doses, either 1,500 or 3,000 ppm for the males and either 3,000 or 6,000 ppm for the females, for 105 weeks. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated rats of each sex. All surviving rats were killed at the end of the period of administration of the test chemical. Groups of 50 male mice were administered one of two doses, either 350 or 700 ppm, for 104 or 105 weeks. Groups of 50 female mice were initially administered one of two doses, either 700 or 1,400 ppm. Due to excessive weight depression in the dosed female mice, the doses for this sex were reduced after week 20 to 200 and 600 ppm, respectively, and administration of the test chemical at the lower doses was continued for 84 or 85 weeks. The time-weighted average doses for the females were 295 and 754 ppm. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving mice were killed at the end of the period of administration of the test chemical. ... It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, technical-grade piperonyl sulfoxide was not carcinogenic for male or female Fischer 344 rats or for female B6C3F1 mice, but was carcinogenic for male B6C3F1 mice, producing an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: Male Rats: Negative; Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Positive; Female Mice: Negative.",

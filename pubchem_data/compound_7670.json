They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Explosive limits specify the concentration range of a material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an ignition source. There are two types of explosive limits: lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL). The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The information may include data from toxicity tests performed on aquatic and/or terrestrial organisms, where available (e.g., acute or chronic aquatic toxicity data for fish, algae, and crustaceans; toxicity data on birds, bees, and plants).  This section also includes information on whether there is a potential for the chemical to persist or degrade in the environment either through biodegradation or other processes (such as oxidation or hydrolysis) as well as the concentration or amount of the chemical found in the environment (e.g., in plants, animals as well as in the atmosphere or water).",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.204 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates that N-ethylaniline will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase N-ethylaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.5 hrs. If released to soil, N-ethylaniline is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 120. However, aromatic amines (including anilines) bind to humic material found in soil in two phases which could decrease movement in soil. Also, a pKa value of 5.09 suggests that N-ethylaniline will exist partially in the protonated form in moist soils and the protonated form of N-ethylaniline is expected to bind strongly to soil surfaces. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, N-ethylaniline is not expected to adsorb to sediment and suspended solids in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 41 hrs and 22 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces may be attenuated by adsorption to humic material in the water column. The protonated form of N-ethylaniline does not volatilize from water. A BCF ranging from 3-13 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to N-ethylaniline may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N-ethylaniline is produced or used. (SRC)",

However, aromatic amines (including anilines) bind to humic material found in soil in two phases(3). Initially, a rapid, reversible equilibrium is established, which may represent formation of imine linkages with the humic carbonyls(3). Subsequently, there is a slow reaction that is not readily reversed(3). Also, a pKa value of 5.09(4) suggests that N-ethylaniline will exist partially in the protonated form in moist soils and the protonated form of N-ethylaniline is expected to bind strongly to soil surfaces. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(5). The few biodegradation studies that have been located have conflicting results concerning the extent of biodegradation. N-ethylaniline has acheived 0-64% of its theoretical BOD in biodegradation studies(6,7).",

Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 41 hrs and 22 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces may be attenuated by adsorption to humic material in the water column(5). Initially, a rapid, reversible equilibrium is established, which may represent formation of imine linkages with the humic carbonyls(5). Subsequently, there is a slow reaction that is not readily reversed(5). A pKa value of 5.12(6), suggests that N-ethylaniline will exist partially in the protonated form in aqueous environments and the protonated form of N-ethylaniline does not volatilize from water. According to a classification scheme(7), a BCF ranging from 3 to 13 (8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. There is not enough experimental data to determine the biodegradation potential of N-ethylaniline. The few studies that have been located have conflicting results concerning the extent of biodegradation(SRC). N-Ethylaniline has acheived 0-64% of its theoretical BOD in biodegradation studies(8,9).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

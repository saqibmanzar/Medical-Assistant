When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The metabolism of PBO was complex with over 25 peaks of radioactivity being seen by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Using HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 12 urine metabolites were assigned structures together with four plus PBO in feces. Metabolism occurred at two sites: the methylenedioxy ring, which opened to form a catechol that could then undergo methylation, and the 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethoxymethyl side-chain, which underwent sequential oxidation to a series of alcohols and acids. The identified metabolites accounted for approximately 60% of the administered dose.",

The main route of excretion was via feces which contained 82.9-85.1% of the administered radioactivity at the low dose level and 64.1-75.9% at the high dose level at 168 hours. The percent radioactive dose excreted in the urine during 168 hours was 11.1-14.4% in low dose group and 19.5-30.2% in the high dose group. The majority of the administered radioactivity was excreted in 0-48 hour urine and feces samples in both dose groups. The percent of administered dose in carcass was below 0.5% in either low dose or high dose groups. The total percent of radioactive dose recovered in both dose groups ranged between 97.4% and 99.6%. There is no significant difference in the excretion pattern either between two dose groups or between sexes in the same dose group. M1 and M3 are the major metabolites excreted in feces. M1 was identified as unchanged PBO corresponding to 15.6-23.9% of administered dose. M3 was identified as PBO with methylenedioxy ring opened to form catechol and found at 17.4-19.7% of the administered dose. M2 and M4/M5 were also identified but were present in low amounts (4-6% of administered radioactivity) in high dose group. Several radioactive peaks (~20 peaks) were observed in urine samples and none of these individual peaks exceeded 5% of the administered radioactivity. The significant metabolite in male urine was found to be M14 which occurred at 3% of the administered dose. In females, the significant urinary metabolites identified were M6 and the combined M7/M8 which contained 5 and 9% of the administered dose, respectively. Although there was no significant difference in the excretion of metabolites between two dose groups, metabolites M5, M8, M9 and M10 were predominantly found in female urine samples and M14 was reported only in male urine samples. Based on the identification of metabolites, the authors proposed three major reactions in the metabolism of PBO: 1) Opening of the methylenedioxy ring to form the catechol; 2) Sequential cleavage of the 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethoxymethyl side chain to produce series of alcohols and acids; 3) Conjugation of one of the phenolic groups to yield glucuronide, sulfate or methoxy derivative.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The incidence of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)-positive foci and PCNA-positive cells was significantly increased in the DEN + PBO group compared with the DEN-alone group. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed up-regulation of genes related to metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 1A1 and 2B10, and metabolic stress, such as Por, Nqo1, Nrf2, abcc3, and abcc4. Early responsive genes downstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), such as c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), were also up-regulated in this group. Positive immunohistochemical staining for ATF3 was diffusely observed in nonproliferating hepatocytes of the DEN + PBO group, but altered foci were negative or weakly positive for ATF3. The nuclei of hepatocytes within ATF3-negative foci were positive for cyclin D. Thus PBO can induce oxidative stress, activate the MAPK pathway, and increase ATF3 transcript levels in hepatocytes outside the altered foci during the early stage of PBO-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. .",

Male F344 rats were administered piperonyl butoxide mixed in the diet at concentrations of 0 (negative control), 0.05, 0.2 or 2% for 2 days, 1, 2, and 4 weeks. As a positive control, phenobarbital was administered to rats for up to 4 weeks as a 0.1% solution in the drinking water. Increased liver weight, centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy due to increased smooth endoplasmic reticulum, decreased numbers and areas of connexin 32-positive spots per hepatocyte, and increased cell proliferation were observed in rats treated with 0.2 and 2% piperonyl butoxide. Similar results were obtained for 0.1% phenobarbital treated rats. Hepatocellular necrosis suggestive of hepatotoxicity was also observed in the 2% piperonyl butoxide group. These results indicate that the promoting mechanism of piperonyl butoxide in hepatocarcinogenesis is similar to that of phenobarbital, involving an ability to induce CYP isoenzymes and inhibit gap junctional intercellular communication. In addition, increased cell proliferation following hepatocellular necrosis may also play a role at high doses.",

Little is known about how insects respond to PBO exposure at the gene transcription level. The authors have characterized the transcriptional response of the Drosophila melanogaster genome after PBO treatment, using both a custom-designed 'detox' microarray, containing cytochrome P450 (P450), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and esterase genes, and a full genome microarray. A subset of P450 and GST genes is identified, along with additional metabolic genes, that are induced by PBO. The gene set is an extremely similar gene set to that induced by phenobarbital, a compound for which pretreatment is known to confer tolerance to a range of insecticide compounds.",

In order to clarify the possible mechanism of non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogenesis induced by PBO, molecular pathological analyses consisting of low-density microarray analysis and real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR were performed in male ICR mice fed a basal powdered diet containing 6000 or 0 ppm PBO for 1, 4, or 8 weeks. The animals were sacrificed at weeks 1, 4, and 8, and the livers were histopathologically examined and analyzed for gene expression using the microarray at weeks 1 and 4 followed by real-time RT-PCR at each time point. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) products were also measured using liver microsomes. At each time point, the hepatocytes of PBO-treated mice showed centrilobular hypertrophy and increased lipofuscin deposition in Schmorl staining. The ROS products were significantly increased in the liver microsomes of PBO-treated mice. In the microarray analysis, the expression of oxidative and metabolic stress-related genes--cytochrome P450 (Cyp) 1A1, Cyp2A5 (week 1 only), Cyp2B9, Cyp2B10, and NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Por) was over-expressed in mice given PBO at weeks 1 and 4. Fluctuations of these genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in PBO-treated mice at each time point. In additional real-time RT-PCR, the expression of Cyclin D1 gene, key regulator of cell-cycle progression, and Xrcc5 gene, DNA damage repair-related gene, was significantly increased at each time point and at week 8, respectively. These results suggest the possibility that PBO has the potential to generate ROS via the metabolic pathway and to induce oxidative stress, including oxidative DNA damage, resulting in the induction of hepatocellular tumors in mice.",

Each of these two formulations were tested on four young, healthy male volunteers, using a single topical application on the ventral forearm under non-occlusive conditions for an 8-h period. The application sites were thoroughly cleaned with cotton swabs moistened with isopropyl alcohol, then rinsed with isopropyl alcohol. Blood from the ipsilateral and contralateral arms, urine and feces were collected at selected intervals during the 8-h application and through a 120-h post-application period. The application area was also tape-stripped to determine if any of the test material accumulated in the stratum corneum. These samples provided data which permitted insight into the kinetics of penetration and elimination processes of PBO. The absorption of PBO either by itself or formulated was very poor, as demonstrated by the radioactivity excreted in the urine, and radioactivity in the ipsilateral plasma. When dosed by itself, approximately 1.78% of the dose was excreted in the urine. In contrast, only 0.47% of the formulated PBO was excreted in the urine. Trace radioactivity was detected in the feces from both formulations. The absorbed radioactivity was rapidly eliminated in the urine. There was no evidence of accumulation of PBO in the skin as evidenced by low amounts of radioactivity in the tape-strippings. The majority of the applied radioactivity was recovered from the skin surface. Total recovery of the applied radioactivity was 100.86 and 104.22% for PBO and the formulated product respectively. Absorbed PBO was completely metabolized to at least three major metabolites prior to its excretion in the urine. The three metabolites represented over 70% of the excreted radioactivity for PBO. The HPLC retention times for these metabolites are different than that seen in rats. The structures of these metabolites have not been elucidated.",

A detailed review of symptoms found that respiratory symptoms (bronchospasm, cough/choke, and dyspnea) and selected dermal symptoms (dermal irritation/pain, itching, and rash) were more likely if the exposure included piperonyl butoxide. These symptoms are likely the reason for increased risk of moderate effects which typically would require medical attention. Other literature suggests that pyrethrin-based products may pose a hazard to asthmatics ... The findings from analysis of symptoms from Poison Control Centers suggests that piperonyl butoxide adds to that risk.",

The signs are similar but are delayed, following a small number of repeated doses sufficient to produce death.

Groups of 4 six wk old female CBA mice were given a single ip injection of 600 mg/kg piperonyl butoxide and 3 hr later each mouse was injected ip with (14)C-dimethylnitrosamine (17 uCi/uM), 2 mg/kg. Mice were sacrificed 4, 8, 12 and 24 hr after piperonyl butoxide treatment and the cytochrome P450 level and macromolecules alkylation were investigated in the liver. Piperonyl butoxide treatment reduced the cytochrome P450 level within 4 hr by 34% but induced an incr of alkylation of macromolecules by (14)C-dimethylnitrosamine: 74% in cytosolic proteins, 55% in microsomal proteins and 30% in DNA ... The time course of this study of this response demonstrates that methylation of DNA reaches maximal value on the 4 hr and that piperonyl butoxide had no effect on the DNA repair.",

Groups of 50 rats of each sex were administered piperonyl butoxide in the diet at one of two doses, either 5,000 or 10,000 ppm, for 107 wk. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated rats of each sex. All surviving rats were killed at the end of the period of administration of the test chemical.  Groups of 50 mice of each sex were initially administered piperonyl butoxide at one of two doses, either 2,500 or 5,000 ppm. After wk 30, the doses for the mice were reduced to 500 and 2,000 ppm, respectively, and administration of the test chemical at the lowered doses was continued for 82 wk. The time-weighted average doses for the mice were either 1,036 or 2,804 ppm. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving mice were killed at the end of the period of administration of the test chemical.  Mean bw of dosed groups of rats and mice of each sex were lower than those of corresponding control groups, and the depressions in bw were dose related. Survival of the rats and mice was unaffected by the piperonyl butoxide and was 80% or greater in all groups at wk 90 of the bioassay; thus, sufficient numbers of dosed and control rats and mice of each sex were at risk for the development of late-appearing tumors.  In female rats, lymphomas occurred at incidences that were dose related (P=0.007); in a direct comparison, the incidence of the tumor in the high-dose group was higher (P=0.020) than that in the control group (controls 1/20, low-dose 7/50, high-dose 15/50). However, the incidence of lymphomas, leukemias, and reticuloses in historical-control female Fischer 344 rats at the same laboratory was 19/191 (10%). These historical-control groups include one with an incidence of animals with lymphoma or leukemia of 7/20 (35%) and another with an incidence of 6/20 (30%). Thus, the incidence of lymphomas in the control female rats of the present bioassay may have been abnormally low, and the occurrence of the higher incidence in the dosed groups cannot be clearly related to administration of piperonyl butoxide.  In the male mice, adenomas of the lacrimal gland occurred at incidences that were dose related (P=0.023), but in direct comparisons the incidences in the individual dosed groups were not significantly higher than that in the control group (controls 0/20, low-dose 0/49, high-dose 4/50); thus, the occurrence of this tumor in the male mice was not clearly related to administration of the test chemical.  It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, piperonyl butoxide was not carcinogenic for Fischer 344 rats or B6C3F1 mice.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.2X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates piperonyl butoxide will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase piperonyl butoxide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.6 hours. Particulate-phase piperonyl butoxide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Piperonyl butoxide contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight; it was rapidly degraded (half-life 8.4 hours) in aqueous solution when illuminated with sunlight. If released to soil, piperonyl butoxide is expected to have moderate to low mobility based upon Koc values ranging from 399-830. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.9X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Piperonyl butoxide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A half-life in aerobic soils of 14 days suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, piperonyl butoxide is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 27 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Piperonyl butoxide is stable to hydrolysis at pH 5, 7 and 9 under sterile, dark conditions. Occupational exposure to piperonyl butoxide may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where piperonyl butoxide is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to piperonyl butoxide via inhalation of dust, ingestion of food, and dermal contact with this compound or other insecticide products containing piperonyl butoxide.

Vapor-phase piperonyl butoxide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.6 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.1X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase piperonyl butoxide may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). Piperonyl butoxide contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC); it was rapidly degraded (half-life 8.4 hours) in aqueous solution when illuminated with sunlight(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3.6 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Piperonyl butoxide is stable to hydrolysis at pH 5, 7 and 9 under sterile, dark conditions, but was rapidly degraded (half-life 8.4 hours) in aqueous solution when illuminated with sunlight(2). After 7 days of exposure to a sunlamp (open dish, weather chamber) or exposed to sunlight (sealed tube), 95% and 96-98%, respectively remained undegraded(3). However, piperonyl butoxide degrades when exposed to sunlight in the presence of a photosensitizer. When radiolabeled piperonyl butoxide was combined with 0, 10 and 100 ppm of rotenone, a photosensitizer with which it is often combined in insecticidal products, and applied to bean leaves, 12.5. 24.2, and 38.0% of the radioactivity was recovered in degradation products(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                        "Description": "A chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols and numbers. PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Its efficiency in virus neutralization was also determined. Overnight (16 hr) treatment with 4% (w/v) tetrasodium EDTA solution reduced salivary and C. albicans biofilm viable counts by > or =99%. Biofilm removal was confirmed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Presence/absence of sucrose during biofilm formation had no effect on killing efficacy. Prolonged treatment of PMMA with tetrasodium EDTA did not influence subsequent formation of C. albicans biofilms or affect surface roughness of the PMMA, but it reduced subsequent biofilm formation from a salivary inoculum. Infectivities of herpes simplex virus and polio virus suspensions were reduced by >99.99% by treatment for 1 and 2 hr, respectively. Tetrasodium EDTA solution efficiently disinfected toothbrushes and PMMA discs, with the detachment of biofilms, and rapidly neutralized both nonenveloped and enveloped viruses. Dentures and toothbrushes become contaminated by bacterial biofilms and by viruses. There is a need for disinfection methods that are rapidly effective, cost-effective, nontoxic and easily implemented. These studies indicate that tetrasodium EDTA solution has disinfection applications in the oral care field.",

Biofilm-associated organisms on the lumens of these catheters have reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial chemotherapy. This study tested the efficacy of tetrasodium EDTA as a catheter lock solution on biofilms of several clinically relevant microorganisms. Biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans were grown to levels of approximately 1 x 10+5 colony-forming units (CFU) cm(-1) on CVC segments in a model system, then subjected to the tetrasodium EDTA lock treatment. Comparisons of biofilms before and after exposure to the 40-mg mL(-1) tetrasodium EDTA lock for 21 hours showed that the biofilm viable cell counts of all organisms tested were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) after exposure to the treatment. Antimicrobial lock treatment using 40 mg mL(-1) of tetrasodium EDTA for at least 21 hours could significantly reduce or potentially eradicate CVC-associated biofilms of clinically relevant microorganisms.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The short-term exposure (also called acute exposure) is a short contact with a chemical. It may last a few seconds or a few hours. For example, it might take a few minutes to clean windows with ammonia, use nail polish remover or spray a can of paint. The fumes someone might inhale during these activities are examples of acute exposures.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer saftey standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate is found on List D. Case No: 4036; Pesticide type: insecticide, fungicide, herbicide, antimicrobial; Case Status: None of the active ingredients in the case are being supported for reregistration by their registrants. All are unsupported, or some are unsupported and some are cancelled. Cases described as \"unsupported\" generally are being processed for cancellation.; Active ingredient (AI): tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate; AI Status:  Registrants of the pesticide have not made or honored a commitment to seek reregistration, conduct the necessary studies, or pay the requisite fees, or they have asked EPA to cancel their product registrations. Unless some other interested party supports them, products containing the pesticide will be cancelled.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

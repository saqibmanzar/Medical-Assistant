In 1927, responsibility of the Food and Drugs Act was transferred to FDA. Increasing government oversight, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) was passed in 1938 and established the three following categories for colors: FD&C: colors used in foods, drugs and cosmetics; D&C: colors used in drugs and cosmetics when in contact with mucous membranes or ingested; and Ext.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.9X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates FD&C Yellow No. 4 will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase FD&C Yellow No. 4 will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.5 hours. Particulate-phase FD&C Yellow No. 4 will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. FD&C Yellow No. 4 contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, FD&C Yellow No. 4 is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 1.1X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.6X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data in soil and water were not available. If released into water, FD&C Yellow No. 4 is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Azo dyes are hydrophobic compounds, suggesting they will partition strongly to bottom sediments where reductive cleavage of the azo linkage may occur. This transformation process could result in the release of potentially hazardous aromatic amines to the water column. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 10 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to FD&C Yellow No. 4 may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where FD&C Yellow No. 4 is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may have be exposed to FD&C Yellow No. 4 via ingestion and dermal contact with consumer products containing FD&C Yellow No. 4, which no longer has food-approved uses.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

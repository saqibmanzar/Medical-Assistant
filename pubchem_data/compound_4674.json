Pamidronic acid binds to and adsorbs onto hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix, thereby preventing osteoclast resorption.

This inhibits the formation of isoprenoid metabolites that are substrates for protein prenylation. This prevents farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of proteins essential for osteoclast function, leading to the induction of apoptosis of osteoclasts. By preventing osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, pamidronic acid decreases bone turnover rate, stabilizes the bone matrix and reduces hypercalcemia.",

The mechanism of action of pamidronate is inhibition of bone resorption. Pamidronate adsorbs to calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) crystals in bone and may directly block dissolution of this mineral component of bone. In vitro studies also suggest that inhibition of osteoclast activity contributes to inhibition of bone resorption. Pamidronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis. Endocytic vesicles become acidified, releasing bisphosphonates into the cytosol of osteoclasts where they act.  Osteoclasts mediate resorption of bone. When osteoclasts bind to bone they form podosomes, ring structures of F-actin. Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption.  Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates such as pamidronate are known to induce apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells by inhibiting the components of the mevalonate pathway farnesyl diphosphate synthase, farnesyl diphosphate, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate. These components are essential for post-translational prenylation of GTP-binding proteins like Rap1. The lack of prenylation of these proteins interferes with their function, and in the case of Rap1, leads to apoptosis. pamidronate also activated caspases 3 and 9 which further contribute to apoptosis.",

Pamidronate adsorbs to calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) crystals in bone and may directly block dissolution of this mineral component of bone. In vitro studies also suggest that inhibition of osteoclast activity contributes to inhibition of bone resorption. Pamidronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass.",

Because pamidronate has a serum half-life of about 3 hours, is highly bound to calcium and is poorly absorbed orally (0.3 to 3% in adults), absorption of pamidronate by a breastfed infant is unlikely. Until more data become available, withholding nursing for 12 to 24 hours after a dose should ensure that the breastfed infant is exposed to little or no pamidronate. Other evidence indicates that breastfeeding after cessation of long-term pamidronate treatment appears to have no adverse effects on the infant. Some experts recommend monitoring the infant's serum calcium during the first 2 months postpartum if the mother received pamidronate during pregnancy or nursing.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

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

A calculated Koc range of 640 to 1100, indicates 2-aminofluorene is characterized by a low mobility class in soil. In aquatic systems, 2-aminofluorene may partition from the water column to organic matter contained in sediments and suspended solids. 2-Aminofluorene also has a low potential to bioconcentrate in aquatic systems. A Henry's Law constant of 3.62X10-8 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C, suggests volatilization of 2-aminofluorene from environmental waters will not be important. 2-Aminofluorene is expected to exist in both the particulate and vapor phases in ambient air. For vapor phase 2-aminofluorene in the atmosphere, the vapor phase reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (half-life of 2 hr) is likely to be an important fate process. Otherwise, washout by precipitation and gravitational settling may be an important removal mechanism for 2-aminofluorene in atmospheric particulate matter. (SRC)",

The vapor phase rection of 2-aminofluorene with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals is likely to be an important fate process. The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 2-aminofluorene with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated to be 2.21X(-10) cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C; which corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2 hours at an atmospheric concn of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2).

An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

These Koc values indicate 2-aminofluorene is characterized by a low mobility class in soil(4). Furthermore, aromatic amines have been observed to undergo rapid and reversible covalent bonding with humic materials in aqueous solution; the initial bonding reaction is followed by a slower and much less reversible reaction believed to represent the addition of the amine to quinonal structures followed by oxidation of the product to give an amino-substituted quinone; these processes represent pathways by which aromatic amines may be converted to latent forms in the biosphere(5).",

It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

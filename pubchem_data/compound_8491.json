The IR spectra tells you what types of vibrational mode (motion) responses occur in a molecule interacting with infrared light.  It is used to help determine the functional groups in a molecule.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Effects from exposure may include headache, weakness, dizziness, nausea, tachycardia, and methemoglobinemia.  In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and protective clothing.  If contact should occur, immediately flush exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. Contaminated clothing and shoes should be removedat the site.  While 2-chloro-4-nitrotoluene does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of irritating or poisonous gases. For fires involving 2-chloro-4-nitrotoluene, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or regular foam.  For small dry spills, use a clean shovel (liquid solutions are taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent) and place into a clean, dry, loosely covered container for later disposal.  Large liquid spills and runoff from fire control water should be diked far ahead for later disposal.",

STARLINGS WERE FOUND TO BE EXTREMELY RESISTANT TO CNT TOXICITY, NO MORTALITY WAS OBSERVED AT THE 4000 MG/KG DOSE. THE APPROXIMATE LD50 DOSE OF CNT IN CHICKENS WAS BETWEEN 100 & 500 MG/KG. THE LD50 DOSE IN RATS WAS 2520 MG/KG. SINCE THE AMINO DERIVATIVE OF THE RELATED CMPD, 3-CHLORO-P-TOLUIDINE, IS MORE TOXIC IN STARLINGS, CHICKENS AND RATS THAN ITS NITRO DERIVATIVE, IT THEN INDICATES THAT THE BASAL ACTIVITY OF NITRO-REDUCTASE IN THESE ANIMALS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS FOR CNT TOXICITY.",

If released to the atmosphere, 2-chloro-4-nitrotoluene is expected to degrade relatively slowly (estimated half-life of 48 days) by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. If released to water, 2-chloro-4-nitrotoluene in near surface water may photolyze; however, rate specific data were not located. Some 2-chloro-4-nitrotoluene may also partition to sediment. Volatilization from water is expected to be moderately slow, but it may be an environmentally significant fate process (volatilization half-life of approximately 32 hr from a model river). Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms may be important; however, no experimental data were located. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an environmentally important fate process. In soil, its estimated Koc of about 1,391 suggests slow mobility in soil. No data are available on other potential degradation processes in soil or water. Workers involved in the use of 2-chloro-4-nitrotoluene as a dye intermediate may be exposed through inhalation of vapors or through eye and skin contact. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

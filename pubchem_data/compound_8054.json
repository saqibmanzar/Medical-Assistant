Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The methyl and ethyl ethers of ethylene glycol, ie 2- methoxyethanol (2-ME) esters, 2-methoxyethyl acetate (2-MEA) and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate (2- EEA) ... are all stable, and are all miscible with (or in the case of 2-EEA very soluble in) water and miscible with a large number of organic solvents. ... The solubility of these glycol ethers in water and their relatively low vapor pressure could result in their build-up in water in the absence of degradation. However, degradation by microorganisms in soil, sewage sludge, and water appears to prevent this possibility. Atmospheric emissions resulting from the use of glycol ethers as evaporative solvents result in the greatest environmental exposure....  Effects on Organisms in the Environment: The toxicity of 2-ME and 2-EE to microorganisms and aquatic animals appears to be low. ... The glycol ether acetates (2-MEA and 2-EEA) are far more toxic to fish. The LC50 of 2-EEA for fathead minnows is 46 mg/L and that of 2-MEA for tidewater silverfish and bluegills is 45 mg/L. ...  Effects on Experimental Animals and In Vitro Test Systems: Systemic toxicity: The toxicity of 2-ME and 2-EE to experimental animals has been much more widely studied than that of 2-MEA and 2-EEA. 2-ME and 2-EE and their acetates have similar lethalities after single exposures and they show low acute lethality whether exposure is via the dermal, oral, or inhalation route. Oral LD60 values for a variety of species range between 900 and 3400 mg/kg body weight for 2-ME, 1400 and 5500 mg/kg for 2-EE, 1250 and 3930 mg/kg for 2-MEA, and 1300 and 5100 mg/kg for 2-EEA. ... Short-term inhalation exposure (up to 90 days) of experimental animals to high concentrations (> 9313 mg 2-ME/cu m ... has been shown to lead to adverse effects on blood parameters, the nervous system, and testes, thymus, kidney, liver, and lung. At lower exposure levels, effects are observed on the hemopoietic system and testes. For example, rats exposed by inhalation to 2-ME for 13 weeks at levels between 93 and 930 mg/cu m exhibited reduced packed cell volume and white blood cell, hemoglobin, platelet, and serum protein concentrations at the highest dose only, while similarly exposed rabbits had decreased thymus size, in addition to the decreased blood parameters, at 930 mg/cu m. ... The mutagenicity of 2-ME has been investigated in a range of in vitro systems using bacteria and mammalian cells. Although most studies yielded negative results, there were reports of positive mutagenicity results at very high 2-ME concentrations in CHO cells when investigated for chromosome aberration (at 6830 ug/mL or more) and sister chromatid exchange (3170 ug/mL or more). However, in vivo studies for chromosome aberrations and micronuclei were negative. ...  The effect of 2-ME on the male reproductive system has been intensively investigated following both oral and inhalation exposure in rodents. Degenerative changes in the germinal epithelium of the seminiferous tubules were consistently noted. ... Oral dosing of rats with 2-ME for 1-11 days resulted in a dose-related decrease in sperm count and changes in sperm motility and morphology at dose levels of 100 mg/kg body weight or more. Marked histological damage was seen in the testes at autopsy. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was 50 mg/kg. Reduced fertility was still evident 8 weeks after exposure to 200 mg/kg. ... Fertility studies following a single oral dose of 250 mg 2-ME/kg or more revealed complete sterility in both rats and mice at 5 weeks post dosing, some decrease in fertility being seen at 125 mg/kg. When the inhalation route was investigated, similar degenerative changes in the testes were seen with 2-ME. Effects were observed following a single exposure (4 hr) to 1944 mg/m3 or more but not to 933 mg/cu m. NOEL values were 311 mg/cu m in rats following exposure for 13 weeks (6 hr/day, 5 day/week) and 933 mg/cu m (6 hr/day) in mice following exposure on 9 occasions over 11 days. Exposure of rabbits to 2-ME for 13 weeks (6 hr/day, 5 days/week) resulted in marked effects on the testes at 311 mg/cu m or more; marginal effects were seen at 93 mg/cu m, and a NOEL was not identified. ... Developmental toxicity has been observed in several species of laboratory animals following exposure by all routes of administration, i.e. oral, inhalation, and dermal. 2-ME produced teratogenic effects in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. ... Although 2-MEA has not been tested for developmental toxicity, metabolic profiles suggest that it is reasonable to expect that 2-MEA would have a toxicity similar to that of 2-ME. The widest range of dose/response data (doses of 31.25 to 1000 mg/kg per day) is available for 2-ME. In this gavage study using mice, (2-ME was administered on days 7 to 14 of gestation), the NOEL for maternal toxicity was 125 mg/kg per day. However, malformations were observed at 62.5 mg/kg per day and skeletal variations at 31.25 mg/kg per day. A NOEL for developmental toxicity was not reported. In single-dose studies, mice were treated with 2-ME by gavage on gestation day 11; 100 mg/kg was not fetotoxic, while 175 mg/kg produced digit defects without other signs of maternal or fetal toxicity. Cardiovascular defects and ECG abnormalities were observed in neonatal rats following treatment on days 7 to 13 of gestation with 25 mg/kg per day. Since that was the lowest dose tested, this study yielded no developmental NOEL (maternal toxicity was not observed at that dose). Similarly, no NOEL for developmental toxicity could be determined when monkeys were treated by gavage with 2-ME at 0.16, 0.32, or 0.47 mmol/kg per day on days 20 to 45 of gestation. Fetotoxicity in mice and rats and malformations in rabbits were observed following exposure by inhalation to 2-ME at 156 mg/m3. For all three species, the NOEL for developmental effects was 31 mg/cu m. However, behavioral and neurochemical alterations were seen in the offspring of rats exposed to 78 mg 2-ME/cu m on days 7-13 or 14-20 of gestation. Following inhalation exposure of rats (743 mg/m3) and rabbits (589 mg/m3), 2-EE was found to be teratogenic (in the presence of slight maternal toxicity). ... Information on the toxic effects of these four glycol ethers on humans is limited. The results from the few case reports and workplace epidemiological studies are consistent with the adverse effects seen in experimental animals. ...",

If released to air, a measured vapor pressure of 7.0 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates that methyl cellosolve acetate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl cellosolve acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.1 days. Methyl cellosolve acetate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methyl cellosolve acetate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 30. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 24 days and 270 days, respectively. This compound's vapor pressure indicates that volatilization from dry soil surfaces is possible. Using aqueous screening tests methyl cellosolve acetate reached 30 to 86.9% of its theoretical BOD over a period of 5 to 14 days, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, the estimated Koc suggests that methyl cellosolve acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be important based on this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis half-lives of 140 and 14 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively, suggest that hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process except under basic conditions. Occupational exposure to methyl cellosolve acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this solvent at workplaces where methyl cellosolve acetate is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

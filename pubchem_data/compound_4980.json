It is found in most psychedelic mushrooms together with its phosphorylated counterpart psilocybin. Psilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The mind-altering effects of psilocin are highly variable and subjective, but resemble those caused by LSD and mescaline. The effects typically last anywhere from three to eight hours depending on certain variables (such as metabolism, food interaction); however the effects can seem to last much longer due to psilocin's ability to distort the perception of time. Sulfur analogs are known with a benzothienyl replacement as well as 4-SH-DMT. N1-methylpsilocin is a functionally 5-HT2C receptor preferring agonists. 4-fluoro-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is known. O-Acetylpsilocin is an acetylized analog of psilocin, also known as 4-AcO-DMT. Additionally, substitution of a methyl group at the dimethylated nitrogen with an isopropyl or ethyl group yields 4-HO-MIPT (4-Hydroxy-N-Methyl-N-Isopropyltryptamine) and 4-HO-MET (4-Hydroxy-N-Methyl-N-Ethyltryptamine), respectively.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

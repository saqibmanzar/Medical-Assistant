They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

This technique is particularly useful to study aromatic, conjugated, and other substances containing a pi bond.  Modern ultraviolet spectrophotometers also cover the visible light range, in which case the technique is called ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Both compounds bind to TTR with high affinity, in competition with the natural ligand thyroxine (T4). The crystal structures of the TTR-PBP and TTR-TBP complexes show some unusual binding patterns for the ligands. They bind exclusively in the `reversed' mode, with their hydroxyl group pointing towards the mouth of the binding channel and in planes approximately perpendicular to that adopted by the T4 phenolic ring in a TTR-T4 complex, a feature not observed before. The hydroxyl group in the ligands, which was previously thought to be a key ingredient for a strong binding to TTR, does not seem to play an important role in the binding of these compounds to TTR. In the TTR-PBP complex, it is primarily the halogens which interact with the TTR molecule and therefore must account for the strong affinity of binding. The interactions with the halogens are smaller in number in TTR-TBP and there is a decrease in affinity, even though the interaction with the hydroxyl group is stronger than that in the TTR-PBP complex.",

In this work an efficient and reliable immunochemical method for analysis of TBP in wood samples has been established consisting of alkaline wood extraction followed by analysis on a microplate ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). TBP is efficiently extracted from wood samples in 10 min and directly measured after 10-fold buffer dilution to avoid matrix interferences. The analytical procedure has a limit of detection of 45 ng/g of TBP in wood (1.5 ug/L in extracts)...",

It is the most widely produced brominated phenol. HUMAN EXPOSURE: Occupational exposures to this compound may occur by both inhalation and dermal routes. Exposure to 2,4,6-tribromophenol would be trough drinking water and consumption of seafood. ANIMAL/INVERTEBRATE/PLANT STUDIES:  2,4,6-Tribromophenol is rapidly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract in mammals and also rapidly excreted via the urine and feces. This compound was not an irritant to rabbit skin, but was moderately irritating to the rabbit eye. It is a skin sensitizer in guinea pigs. A combined repeated dose oral toxicity study with reproduction/developmental toxicity screening test on 2,4,6-tribromophenol in rats showed reduced body weight gain, increases in absolute and liver weights in both sexes, increases in total protein, albumin, albumin/globulin ratio and ALP in blood of male rats. Salivation was noted in both sexes and increase in blood creatinine was observed in male rats. No adverse effects were noted on esterous  cyclicity, copulation index, fertility index, duration of gestation period, number of corpora lutea, number of imnplants, toat number of pups and live pups, implantation index, or delivery index in any treated group. Neonatal viability on day four of lactation was and neonatal body weights were lower than controls. In vitro reverse mutation studies with this compound in two types of bacteria were negative. One in vitro chromosomal aberration test was positive with and without metabolic activation. One in vivo micronucleus assay up to the maximum tolerated dose was negative. In the marine environment, 2,4,6-tribromophenol is found in pristine soft bottom habitats. Brominated phenols including 2,4,6-tribromophenol are biosynthesized by algae, polychetes, hemichordates along with marine sponges.[",

Effects were studied in the concentration range from 0.5 to 7.5 uM; exposures were for 24 hr. Both 6-OH-BDE47 and 6-OH-BDE99 showed an inhibitory effect on aromatase activity at concentrations >2.5 uM and >5 uM, respectively. However, 6-OH-BDE47 also caused a statistically significant increase in cytotoxicity (based on mitochondrial MTT reduction and lactate dehydrogenase-leakage [LDH]) at concentrations >2.5 uM that could explain in part the apparent inhibitory effect on aromatase activity. Compared to 6-OH-BDE47, the methoxy analog (6-CH(3)O-BDE47) did not elicit a cytotoxic effect, whereas significant inhibition of aromatase remained. TBP caused a concentration-dependent induction of aromatase activity between 0.5 and 7.5 uM (with a maximum of 3.8-fold induction at 7.5 uM). This induction was not observed when a OH- group replaced the CH(3)O- group or when bromine atoms adjacent to this OH- group were absent...",

They are thought to cause the typical sea-like taste and flavor. The ecological function of brominated phenols is not clear yet, but they may play a role in chemical defense and deterrence ... In this study 2-bromophenol (2-BP), 4-bromophenol (4-BP), 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP), 2,6-dibromophenol (2,6-DBP) and 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP), all of which are present in marine organisms, were tested. Especially 2,4-DBP and 2,4,6-TBP showed a significant effect on the Ca2+ homeostasis in endocrine cells (PC 12). The reduction of depolarization induced Ca2+ elevations by 2,4-DBP and 2,4,6-TBP and the increase of intracellular Ca2+ by both substances, partly released from intracellular stores, may suggest a link to the disrupting effect of endocrine systems by brominated phenols. 2,4-DBP was the most potent substance ... tested in respect to inhibition of voltage dependent Ca2+ currents as revealed in whole cell patch clamp experiments.

There is a wide occurrence of bromophenols in marine algae which provides a possible source of such compounds in fish that feed predominantly on ocean plants. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.0X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4,6-tribromophenol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase 2,4,6-tribromophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 34 days. Particulate-phase 2,4,6-tribromophenol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2,4,6-Tribromophenol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,4,6-tribromophenol is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,200. The pKa of 2,4,6-tribromophenol is 6.80, indicating that this compound will partially exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.8X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. A theoretical BOD of 49% using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 2,4,6-tribromophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF of 83 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2,4,6-tribromophenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4,6-tribromophenol is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,4,6-tribromophenol via ingestion of food and drinking water, or dermal contact with products containing 2,4,6-tribromophenol.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

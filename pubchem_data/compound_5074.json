A potent and long-acting seratonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) antagonist of the subtype 5-HT2 (Ki = 0.39 nM), it is used in the treatment of a variety of disorders including anxiety, depression and schizophrenia. It has little sedative action. It has a role as a dopaminergic antagonist, a serotonergic antagonist, an antipsychotic agent, an anxiolytic drug, an antidepressant and an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor. It is an organofluorine compound, a member of piperidines and a thiazolopyrimidine.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 10.8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diethyl carbonate will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase diethyl carbonate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days. Diethyl carbonate may undergo direct photolysis since this compound contains a functional group that can absorb light greater than 290 nm. If released to soil, diethyl carbonate is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 100. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.9X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon the vapor pressure. Although no biodegradation data for diethyl carbonate was located, chemically similar short alkyl chain esters have been shown to biodegrade. If released into water, diethyl carbonate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 hours and 8 days, respectively. Diethyl carbonate may undergo hydrolysis in water since this compound contains hydrolyzable functional groups. An estimated BCF of 2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to diethyl carbonate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diethyl carbonate is produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase diethyl carbonate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days(SRC), calculated from its estimated rate constant of 3.3X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) determined using a structure estimation method(3). Diethyl carbonate may also undergo direct photolysis in the environment since this compound contains a functional group that can absorb light greater than 290 nm(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The methods used for identification are generally nonspecific if analyzed concurrently with ethanol or require an additional analytical procedure that employs mass spectrometry. A previously published technique utilizing a capillary flow technology splitter to simultaneously quantitate and confirm ethyl alcohol by flame ionization and mass spectrometric detection after headspace sampling and gas chromatographic separation was evaluated for the detection of inhalants. Methanol, isopropanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone, isoamyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (Norflurane, HFC-134a), chloroethane, trichlorofluoromethane (Freon-11), dichlorodifluoromethane (Freon-12), dichlorofluoromethane (Freon-21), chlorodifluoromethane (Freon-22) and 1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane (Freon-114) were validated for qualitative identification by this method. The validation for qualitative identification included evaluation of matrix effects, sensitivity, carryover, specificity, repeatability and ruggedness/robustness.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

It is also referred to as CFC-21 but has fewer uses than other chlorofluorocarbons.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Inhalation of dichlorofluoromethane can cause confusion, drowsiness, and unconsciousness; and direct contact with skin can cause frostbite. Limited information was available on the toxicity and exposure to humans. One case study in which dicholorfluoromethane was one of the components of a water-repellent spray that was used  in an insufficiently ventilated room by two young people, a 23 year man and his wife aged 21, who were admitted to the hospital with complaints of headache; nausea, dyspnea. Volatiles are frequently abused as inhalants.  ANIMAL STUDIES: When administered alone to anesthetized mice at a concentration of 100,000 ppm, CFC-21 induced arrhythmia and sensitized the heart to epinephrine. Tachycardia with hypotension was observed in both monkeys and dogs that were anesthetized and exposed at 50,000-100,000 ppm. Bronchoconstriction was noted at 25,000 ppm. Repeated exposures have produced marked hepatic damage or failure. Ten of ten rats survived exposure at 10,000 ppm CFC-21, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 2 weeks, but their livers were grossly pale and heavy. Histopathologic examination showed centrilobular necrosis with related changes. In comparable 90-day series of exposure at 5000 and 1000 ppm levels, rats showed bilateral hair loss and excessive mortality (20 of 54 died at 1000 ppm, 15 of 54 at 5000 ppm). Four dogs exposed at both levels showed weight loss. Cirrhosis was evident in rats exposed at both levels, but with dogs histopathologic changes in the liver were mild and evident only at the 5000 ppm. CFC-21 has produced pre-implantation loss in pregnant rats exposed at 10,000 ppm. After exposure for 6 hr daily, on days 6 to 15 of gestation, 15 or 25 pregnant females had no viable fetuses or implantation sites on the uterine wall. Pregnancy outcome and fetal development in the other 10 rats were unaffected.",

These symptoms are related with the use of a water-repellent spray in bad conditions; troubles appear because the product is used in an insufficiently ventilated room. At the admission time, the man suffers from coughing, polypnea, giddiness, the fever is 38 degrees, 3 C. The blood gas values are normal. The thoracic Xray is also normal. The woman is more affected the fever is 38.8 degrees C. The signs are worse and the blood value of CO is 5%. The blood gas values are: PO2 64.8 mm HG, SaO2 /artial saturation of oxygen/ 92.4%, PCO2 28.8 mm Hg. The chest Xray shows signs of acute pulmonary edema. Corticoids and furosemide give a progressive improvement. 48 hr later a favorable evolution is noted in the two cases. The German manufacturer of the product gave its composition which is as follows: - petrol 17.3% - essence 15.3% - methylene chloride 13.7% - freon (trichlorofluoro-methane - dichlorofluoromethane) 42.2% - impregnant (melamine resin; organic methylic soap) 2.6% - propan butan 9.2%. The compound responsible for the symptomatology is petrol vapor which, if inhalated, is well known to produce pulmonary toxicity. The woman's condition was worse because she used the spray herself and therefore inhaled a lot a vapours. With this type of product the direction for use have to be strictly followed ie the operation must take place in a well ventilated room.",

It may be concluded from this study that FC 11, FC 12 and FC 114 exhibit a vasodepressor activity on skeletal muscle vascular bed which is readily overcome by the hypotension-induced activation of the sympathetic system but which becomes evident when reflex activity is prevented by vagotomy. ...",

Four high dose males were found dead during the exposure period and one female and six males from the high dose group were found dead during the recovery period. High dose rats were observed to have statistically significant (p < 0.01) lower body weights than controls during the exposure period, but were comparable after the 30 day recovery period. Hematology, clinical chemistry and urine analysis values were similar between all dosed animals and control animals, with the exception of a slightly higher total blood leukocytes counts and elevated mean SAP and SGPT values for high dose animals at approximately 45, 90 and 120 days. A dose related increase in urine fluoride levels was also observed.

Its use as an approved inert ingredient in pesticides for nonfood uses as a propellant will result in its direct release to the environment. Per 40CFR82, which implements the Montreal Protocol, dichlorofluoromethane will no longer be produced or imported in the United States after 2015, except for its use as a refrigerant in equipment manufactured before 1/1/2020; no production or importing after 1/1/2030 will be allowed. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.36X10+03 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dichlorofluoromethane will exist solely in the gas-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Gas-phase dichlorofluoromethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.5 years. If released to soil, dichlorofluoromethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 32. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.08X10-02 atm-cu m/mole. Dichlorofluoromethane is expected to volatilize rapidly from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Dichlorofluoromethane has been observed to biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in various microcosm experiments using soil, aquatic sediment and sewage sludge. Complete aerobic biodegradation of dichlorofluoromethane in soil by methanotrophic bacteria in 5-19 days has been reported. If released into water, dichlorofluoromethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Approximately 93% and 50% degradation of dichlorofluoromethane in anoxic sediment samples collected from freshwater and saltwater wetlands occurred within 27 and 43 days, respectively. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A half-life of approximately 230 years for the neutral and alkaline hydrolysis reactions for dichlorofluoromethane indicates hydrolysis will not be an important fate process. Occupational exposure to dichlorofluoromethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact of this compound at workplaces where dichlorofluoromethane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dichlorofluoromethane via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Dichlorofluoromethane has been observed to biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in various microcosm experiments using soil, aquatic sediment and sewage sludge(8-10). Approximately 93% and 50% degradation of dichlorofluoromethane in anoxic sediment samples collected from freshwater and saltwater wetlands occurred within 27 and 43 days, respectively, at 20 degrees(8). Rate constants for the neutral and alkaline hydrolysis reactions for dichlorofluoromethane are 2.1X10-10 and 5.4X10-09 L/mole-min, respectively(11); these rates correspond to a half-life of approximately 230 years(11).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of approximately 1.5 years at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). Utilizing a two-dimensional, tropospheric model that considers both vertical and latitudinal transport as well as reaction with atmospheric species, the half-life of dichlorofluoromethane in the troposphere is estimated to be 2.0 yr(3). As a result of its long half-life, the dichlorofluoromethane released to the atmosphere will accumulate in the atmosphere and disperse over a large area(3). About 5% of the dichlorofluoromethane is predicted to diffuse to the stratosphere(3) where it will be destroyed as a result of photodissociation and reaction with hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen (O(1D)) atoms(3-6). In the process, free radicals are released which react with the ozone layer. Rate constants for the neutral and alkaline hydrolysis reactions for dichlorofluoromethane are 2.1X10-10 and 5.4X10-09 L/mole-min; these rates correspond to a half-life of approximately 230 years(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that dichlorofluoromethane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 3 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 4 days(SRC). Dichlorofluoromethane's estimated Henry's Law constant(SRC) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces will occur rapidly(SRC).

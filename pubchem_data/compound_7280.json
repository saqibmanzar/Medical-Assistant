Large amounts of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane were used in the past on certain farms to kill pests that harmed crops. Farmers in all states other than Hawaii stopped using this chemical in 1979. Hawaii stopped using it in 1985. We do not know exactly how much of it is currently made or used by industry, but it is probably a small amount.",

Chronic (long-term) exposure to DBCP in humans causes male reproductive effects, such as decreased sperm counts. Testicular effects and decreased sperm counts were observed in animals chronically exposed to DBCP by inhalation. Available human data on DBCP and cancer are inadequate. High incidences of tumors of the nasal tract, tongue, adrenal cortex, and lungs of rodents were reported in a National Toxicology Program (NTP) inhalation study.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

NPS concentrations in the testis and kidney were not lowered by DBCP. Liver, kidney and testis all exhibited increases in tissue nonprotein sulfhydryl concentrations 48 hr after treatment; the effects were most prominent in the outer medullary section of the kidney 24 hr after treatment with 80 mg/kg of DBCP. The glutathione depleting agent diethyl maleate transiently lowered hepatic, renal and caput epididymal nonprotein sulfhydryl concentrationsin a dose and time dependent manner. Renal and caput epididymal nonprotein sulfhydryl contents were increased relative to control 24 hr after diethyl maleate treatment. Single sc injections of DBCP produced dose dependent lesions in the kidney, testis, caput epididymis and liver. Diethyl maleate treatment 90 min before DBCP treatment enhanced the nephrotoxic potency of DBCP as indicated by greater elevations of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentrations and by more severe renal tubular necrosis in diethyl maleate pretreated thanin vehicle controls, as determined 48 hr after DBCP exposure. Seminiferous tubular degeneration, as determined 48 hr post-DBCP treatment, was greater in rats pretreated with 600 mg/kg of diethyl maleate than in nonpretreated controls. When examined 16 days after DBCP treatment, however, the severity of testicular atrophy was virtually the same in rats pretreated with a lower dose of diethyl maleate (400 mg/kg) as in nonpretreated rats. These results indicate that DBCP is a depletor of hepatic and caput epididymal NPS in the acutely toxic dose range. Inasmuch as NPS concentrations were not lowered in two of the major target organs, kidney and testis, acute DBCP injury would not appear to be dependent on local glutathione depletion. However, the greater susceptibility of kidney and testis to DBCP injury after diethyl maleate pretreatment suggests an important role for nonprotein sulfhydryl, particularly those in the liver, in modulating DBCP toxicities.",

Large amounts of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane were used in the past on certain farms to kill pests that harmed crops. Farmers in all states other than Hawaii stopped using this chemical in 1979. Hawaii stopped using it in 1985. We do not know exactly how much of it is currently made or used by industry, but it is probably a small amount.",

Chronic (long-term) exposure to DBCP in humans causes male reproductive effects, such as decreased sperm counts. Testicular effects and decreased sperm counts were observed in animals chronically exposed to DBCP by inhalation. Available human data on DBCP and cancer are inadequate. High incidences of tumors of the nasal tract, tongue, adrenal cortex, and lungs of rodents were reported in a National Toxicology Program (NTP) inhalation study.

Mix and shovel into paper boxes. Place in an open incinerator. Cover with scrap wood and paper. Ignite with an excelsior train; stay on upwind side or dump into a closed incinerator with afterburner. - Dissolve in a flammable solvent. Spray into the firebox of an incinerator equipped with afterburner and scrubber (alkali). Recommendable methods: Adsorption & incineration. Peer review: Dilute well with hydrocarbon fuel. Adsorb on vermiculite or sodium carbonate. Incinerate with excess non halogenated waste. (Peer-review conclusions of an IRPTC expert consultation (May 1985))",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The space between primary & secondary container should be filled with absorbent material, which would withstand chem attack from the carcinogen & is sufficient to absorb the entire contents of the primary container in the event of breakage or leakage. Each secondary container should then be enclosed in a strong outer box. The space between the secondary container & the outer box should be filled with an appropriate quantity of shock-absorbent material. Sender should use fastest & most secure form of transport & notify recipient of its departure.

The mechanism of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane's testicular toxicity is believed to be due to either the inhibition of sperm carbohydrate metabolism, probably at the step of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase activity in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, or drect DNA damage caused by its metabolites.

It is suggested that the gonadotoxic effect of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP) in human males is reversible, being inversely related to previous exposure time and being most likely to occur in the presence of normal follicle stimulating hormone values. The further incr in plasma follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone & the moderate decr in the mean testosterone level in non-recovered workers may suggest a delayed toxic effect of DBCP on Sertoli and Leydig cell function during the four yr follow-up period.",

DBCP was an early RACB study using Swiss CD-1 mice. Data on food & water consumption's, body weights, & clinical signs during a 2 wk dose-range-finding study (Task 1) were used to set exposure concns for the Task 2 continuous cohabitation study at 25.0, 50.0, & 100.0 mg/kg by gavage in corn oil. In the F0 animals, 4 females, 2 females, 2 females, & 3 females & a male died in the control through high dose groups, respectively. The deaths were not attributed to DBCP exposure. In the low & high dose groups, there was a 10% & 8%, respectively, decr in the number of litters/pair. However, there was no change in the number of pups/litter, pup viability, or pup weight adjusted for litter size. There were no treatment-related reductions in F0 mouse body weight. In the absence of a change in pup parameters, no Task 3 was conducted, & the control & high dose mice were reared for second generation evaluation. Body weights between mice in these 2 groups were not different at weaning or at cohabitation. In the Task 4 F1 mating trial, controls & high dose DBCP mice delivered the same number of litters/group, pups/litter, & proportion viable pups; adjusted pup body weight was not affected by DBCP. After the F2 litters were delivered & evaluated, the F1 adults were killed & necropsied. In the high dose treated males, there was a 16% incr in relative liver weight, & a decr of 8% & 20% in relative epididymis & prostate weights, respectively. There were no differences between the groups in sperm endpoints. DBCP treatment increased female relative liver weight by 6%; vaginal cytology was not performed. This study found that DBCP produced minor effects (fewer litters/F0 pair, & reduced epididymis & prostate weights in F1 mice) concomitant with minor increases in liver weight & no change in body weight. These changes are relatively small, compared to effects seen in rats, & probably represent a significant species difference in response.",

The use of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane as a laboratory reactant is not expected to result in large quantities being released to the environment. If released to the atmosphere, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on a measured vapor pressure of 0.58 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 37 days. Products of 1,2-dibromopropanol, chlorobromopropanol, and 1-bromo-3-chloro-2-propanone are formed during this process. 1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane released to soil will likely volatilize or leach. In alkaline, but not neutral or acidic soils, hydrolysis may be significant. Biodegradation is possible but is expected to be slow relative to volatilization and leaching. In water, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane is expected to volatilize. It may also slowly hydrolyze (half-life= 38 years, neutral pH, at 25 \u00b0C). Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 14 hours and 9 days, respectively. In groundwater, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane is expected to persist due to its low estimated rate of hydrolysis (half-life= 141 years, neutral pH, at 15 \u00b0C). In surface waters, biodegradation may occur, but is expected to be slow relative to the rate of volatilization. Photodegradation is not expected to be an important fate process for this compound. Sorption to sediments and bioconcentration are not expected to be important fate processes based on measured Koc values of 40-149 and measured BCF values of 3.6-19, respectively. Human exposure is expected to result primarily from ingestion of drinking water, particularly from groundwater sources, containing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane. Occupational exposure to 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane is likely via inhalation and dermal contact with vapors, water, and products containing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloro-propane. (SRC)",

The chemical was still present 40 wk after application; and its distribution in soil was proportional to size of soil particles, with greatest distribution found in sandy soils & lowest in clay. In field experiments, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane was detected in soil at levels in the mean range of 0.008-1.64 mg/kg from 1 day to 16 wk after application at the rate of 13.75 kg/ha. Volatilization is expected to be the primary fate of DBCP near the soil surface. Leaching to groundwater is also anticipated based on the demonstrated weak adsorption of DBCP to several soils. Hydrolysis in acidic and neutral soils is not expected to be significant, but may be so in alkaline soils. Although biodegradation may also be significant, it is expected to be a slow process relative to leaching and volatilization.",

Persistence of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane was much greater when injected into soils than when applied to soils in irrigation water(1). The most rapid rate of dehalogenation (20% in 1 week) was obtained with pH 8 soil suspensions; the maximum observed dehalogenation was 63% after 4 weeks under unspecified conditions(2). Biodegradation of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane in aerobic soil columns gave half-lives of 6.6, 13.0, and 1130 days for natural, nutrient-enriched, and sterile conditions, respectively(3). In other experiments however, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane was not aerobically degraded in soil over a period of time ranging up to several months(4,5). Soil samples, maintained under anaerobic conditions, transformed 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane, at 10 and 100 mg/kg suspension, with 5.6 and 11.6% conversion, respectively, in 28 days(4)",

Due to the low measured hydrolysis rate at neutral pH (estimated half-life= 38 years at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7)(4), volatilization is expected to be the predominant fate of aqueous 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane) under neutral conditions. In basic solution, however, hydrolysis is expected to compete with volatilization, forming 2-bromoallyl alcohol(5). 1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane should volatilize from water surfaces(1,SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values for vapor pressure(6) and water solubility(6). Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 14 hours and 9 days, respectively(1,SRC). Photodegradation is not expected to be a major fate process for this compound in water based on experimental results in natural water(7).",

Biodegradation of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane was measured in soil columns; half-lives of 6.6, 13.0, and 1130 days were obtained for natural, nutrient-enriched, and sterile conditions, respectively(3). Two soil samples, four subsoil materials and groundwater samples, and a sewage sample were incubated in the presence of 0.05 to 500 mg 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane/kg soil, soil suspension, or water. No transformation was noted, by formation of inorganic halide or organic products or by the production of CO2, over 60 days(4). Soil samples, maintained under anaerobic conditions, transformed 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane, at 10 and 100 mg/kg suspension, with 5.6 and 11.6% conversion, respectively, in 28 days(4). Groundwater and aquifer samples incubated under similar, anaerobic conditions were unable to convert 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane over a 4 month period(4). Alkyl reductive dehalogenation was reported as a transformation mechanism for the biodegradation of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane in anaerobic soil(5).",

An Arrhenius plot of these data yielded estimated half-lives of 38 and 141 years at 25 and 15 \u00b0C, respectively, at pH 7(1). Under alkaline conditions, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane is hydrolyzed to 2-bromoallyl alcohol(2). A half-life of 6.1 years, due mainly to hydrolysis, was calculated in a study examining the fate of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane in both groundwater and groundwater/aquifer solids(4). Laboratory studies in phosphate buffer solutions indicate that 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane dehydrohalogenation to 2-bromo-3-chloro-1-propene (95%) and 2,3-dibromo-1-propene (5%) occurs followed by hydrolysis to the corresponding allyl alcohols; dehydrohalogenation is relatively slow when compared to the hydrolysis of this compound(4). Irradiation of an aqueous solution of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane in pyrex tubes, using a mercury vapor UV lamp, resulted in negligible photodegradation(5). The addition of hydrogen peroxide to the solution increased the rate of photodegradation noticeably, suggesting that this compound may be degraded in natural waters containing a high concentration of hydroxyl radicals(5).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

A Kd value of 0.286 L/kg was measured in Hanford sandy loam soil columns(2). Values of 40 (Koc value)(3) and 128 (Kom value)(4) were measured for 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane in unspecified soils. Koc values of 129 and 149 were measured in a silt loam and in a fine sand soil, respectively(5). Koc values of 305 and 355 were measured for aquifer solids from the Fresno aquifer (pH 7.3-7.7, mass fraction of organic carbon=0.0002); a calculated Rf value from these results indicates that only about 10% of the 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane is sorbed to the aquifer material(6). Koc values for 3 soils ranged from 70 to 126 (pH 7.6-8.1, mass fraction of organic carbon=0.0052-0.0544)(6).

This value indicates that 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane will volatilize from water surfaces(2,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 14 hours(2,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 9 days(2,SRC). 1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane's values for vapor pressure(1) and Henry's Law constant(1,SRC) indicate that volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).",

Volatilization rates of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane were higher from sand (0.8% organic matter, pH= 7.2) and silt loam(0.5% organic matter, pH= 8.4) than from clay loam(1.6% organic matter, pH= 7.8), possibly due to decreased adsorption processes(2). Volatilization losses to the atmosphere accounted for at least 85% of the 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane lost over 42 days during experiments meant to mimic citrus irrigation practices(water applications were performed cyclically)(3). Losses of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane due to volatilization were significantly reduced by the application of water immediately following the introduction of this compound to soil(3). In other experiments, air levels of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane 4 feet above shank-injection-treated soil rarely exceeded 1 ppb beyond 1 day post treatment(4). During water-run treatments, air concentrations 4 feet above the surface did not exceed 300 ppb for more than a few hours during application(4).",

In the California Department of Pesticide Regulation database (data collected from 1975-1991), 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane was present in 2480 California wells at a maximum concentration of 60 ug/l(2). In public drinking water wells alone, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane was detected in 275 wells at a maximum concentration of 7.4 ug/l(2). Although 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane was banned in California in 1979, increasing concentrations were being detected in well water as of 1984(3). By 1984, 1,473 wells in California contained 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane at concentrations above 1 ppb(3). About half of the well water samples collected in the San Joaquin Valley contained 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane at an average concentration of 5 ug/l; wells less than 30 m deep were more likely to be contaminated(4). Groundwater from beneath the Rocky Mountain Arsenal contained 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane at unreported concentrations, most likely from a pesticide manufacturer located on site(5). In a random survey of wells serving fewer than 10,000 persons or more than 10,000 persons, 1 well (at a concentration of 5.5 ug/l, quantitation limit= 5.0 ug/l) and 0 wells, respectively, contained 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane(6).",

Groundwater from the same sites contained 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane at 1.2 to 12 ug/l(3). By 1986, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane was detected in California soils at depths >120 m(3).",

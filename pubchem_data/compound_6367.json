PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

It is calculated as the sum of the mass of each constituent atom multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula.  The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Vapor forms an explosive mixture with air [Kirk-Othmer, 3rd ed., Vol. 1, 1978, p. 162]. Polymerization reaction with dimethyl sulfoxide is particularly violent [Buckley, A., J. Chem. Ed., 1965, 42, p. 674]. May react vigorously or explosively if mixed with diisopropyl ether or other ethers in the presence of trace amounts of metal salts [J. Haz. Mat., 1981, 4, 291].",

Vapors form explosive mixtures with air: indoors, outdoors and sewers explosion hazards. Most vapors are heavier than air. They will spread along ground and collect in low or confined areas (sewers, basements, tanks). Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Those substances designated with a (P) may polymerize explosively when heated or involved in a fire. Substance will react with water (some violently) releasing flammable, toxic or corrosive gases and runoff. Contact with metals may evolve flammable hydrogen gas. Containers may explode when heated or if contaminated with water.",

In the white/white+ eye mosaic assay, a screening system measuring predominantly homologous recombination in somatic cells, only marginal genotoxic activities were observed for acetyl chloride (ACl), glycolaldehyde (GCA), 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl ether (DDE) and methyl carbamate (MC), whereas VCl, 2-chloroacetaldehyde (CAA), VBr, 2-bromoacetaldehyde (BAA) and EC were clearly recombinogenic in the assay. Those chemicals proven to be recombinogenic in somatic cells were investigated further in postmeiotic male germ cells, utilizing as descriptors of their genotoxicity I(CL/RL) and M(exr-)/M(exr+) indices. The I(CL/RL) index is the rate of induced chromosome loss (CL), a clastogenic event, divided by the forward mutation rate, measured as recessive lethal (RL) mutations in 700 loci of the X-chromosome. The M(exr-)/M(exr+) mutation enhancement ratio is obtained by determining RL under excision repair deficient versus repair proficient conditions. With I(CL/RL) values (2.7-6.9) similar to those obtained for cross-linking agents, vinyl chloride, vinyl bromide, ethyl carbamate and vinyl carbamate are all efficient clastogenic agents in Drosophila germ cells. In the absence of excision repair, however, neither CEO nor CAA gave a hypermutability response (M(exr-)/M(exr+) approximately 1). By contrast, VCl, VBr, EC and VC showed clearly enhanced M(exr-)/M(exr+) ratios, suggesting that these compounds produce some repairable DNA modification(s) that are not generated by their epoxides. This unexpected finding points to the formation of other, yet unknown, metabolites of vinyl chloride, vinyl bromide, ethyl carbamate and vinyl carbamate. Our results support the concept that the epoxides chloroethylene oxide (CEO), bromoethylene oxide (BEO) and vinyl carbamate epoxide (VCO) are the most essential mutagenic intermediates. Compared to chloroethylene oxide (CEO), 2-chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) was approximately 50 times less effective in the induction of RL, whereas BAA was inactive as a mutagen. These findings are consistent with the general view that CAA and BAA play no major role in the genotoxic action of vinyl halides.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 287 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates acetyl chloride will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase acetyl chloride will react with atmospheric moisture and its half-life will depend on the humidity of the air. No half-lives for air with different water contents could be found; however, acetyl chloride is known to fume in moist air. Acetyl chloride contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, acetyl chloride is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. However, acetyl chloride reacts violently in the presence of water and combined with the reported high reactivity of structurally-similar compounds with active hydrogen groups that occur in soil, it is unlikely that acetyl chloride would persist for long in moist soils. Acetyl chloride may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil were not available. If released in water, acetyl chloride is not expected to persist as it reacts violently with water. Adsorption to sediment, volatilization, bioconcentration in aquatic species or biodegradation are not expected because of the very short lifetime of this compound in water. Occupational exposure to acetyl chloride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where acetyl chloride is produced or used. The general public is not expected to be exposed to acetyl chloride. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase acetyl chloride may be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 years(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 9.1X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). However, acetyl chloride decomposes violently in the presence of water(4) and fumes in the presence of moist air(5). Acetyl chloride contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

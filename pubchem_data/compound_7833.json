If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This occurs because the blood level of the ovotoxic 4-vinylcyclohexene metabolite, 4-vinylcyclohexene-1,2-epoxide, is dramatically higher in 4-vinylcyclohexene treated female mice compared with rats. This species difference in 4-vinylcyclohexene epoxidation is also reflected in the rate of 4-vinylcyclohexene metabolism by hepatic microsomes (female mouse greater than female rat). The present study assessed the ability of microsomes obtained from human liver to metabolize 4-vinylcyclohexene to epoxides since humans are exposed to 4-vinylcyclohexene in certain occupational settings. The production of 4-vinylcyclohexene-1,2-epoxide and 4-vinylcyclohexene-7,8-epoxide from 4-vinylcyclohexene (1 mM) by human hepatic microsomes was linear with respect to microsomal protein concentration (0.25-1.0 mg/ml) and incubation time (5-20 min). 4-Vinylcyclohexene-1,2-epoxide was the major metabolite, while the rate 4-vinylcyclohexene-7,8-epoxide formation was about 6 fold lower and in some cases was below the limit of detection. There was no dramatic difference in the rate of 4-vinylcyclohexene epoxidation by hepatic microsomes obtained from male and female humans. The rate of 4-vinylcyclohexene-1,2-epoxide formation by female human hepatic microsomes was 0.71 + or - 0.35 nmol/mg microsomal protein/min (n = 4). This is 13 and 2 fold lower than the rate of 4-vinylcyclohexene-1,2-epoxide formation by female mouse and rat hepatic microsomes, respectively.",

A chronic carcinogenicity bioassay conducted by the NTP showed that oral administration of 4-vinylcyclohexene induced tumors in the ovaries of mice but not in those of rats. The hypothesis tested was that the species and organ specificity of 4-vinylcyclohexene toxicity was due to differences in the disposition of 4-vinylcyclohexene between the female rat and mouse. Therefore, the disposition of a single oral dose of 400 mg/kg (14)C 4-vinylcyclohexene was studied in female B6C3F1 mice and Fischer 344 rats. Mice eliminated greater than 95% of the dose in 24 hr, whereas rats required 48 hr to eliminate greater than 95% of the dose. The major routes of excretion of (14)C 4-vinylcyclohexene derived radioactivity were in the urine (50-60%) and expired air (30-40%). No evidence was obtained to indicate that the ovaries of either species retained 4-vinylcyclohexene as a parent cmpd or as radioactive equivalents. A dramatic difference was observed between the rat and mouse in the appearance of a monoepoxide of 4-vinylcyclohexene in blood from 0.5 to 6 hr after 4-vinylcyclohexene administration (800 mg/kg, ip). 4-Vinylcyclohexene-1,2-epoxide was present in the blood of mice with the highest concentration at 2 hr (41 nmol/ml). The blood concentration of 4-vinylcyclohexene-1,2-epoxide in rats was less than 2.5 nmol/ml at all times examined. 4-Vinylcyclohexene-7,8-epoxide was not present in the blood of either species at the level of detection. These findings were supported by in vitro studies of 4-vinylcyclohexene epoxidation by liver microsomes. The rate of epoxidation of 4-vinylcyclohexene (1 mM) to 4-vinylcyclohexene-1,2-epoxide was 6.5 fold greater in mouse liver microsomes than that in rat liver microsomes. The species difference in the rate of epoxide formation by the liver may be an important factor in the species difference in susceptibility to 4-vinylcyclohexene induced ovarian tumors.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The study was initiated because of numerous complaints of eye, nasal, skin, and respiratory irritation among workers at an industrial facility. Serum samples were obtained from 31 workers and assayed for immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin E to an unspecified number of chemicals. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique was used to detect the antibodies. Immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin E antibodies against four chemicals were found: an aliphatic diisocyanate, 4-vinylcyclohexene-dioxide, trimellitic anhydride, and an unknown substance which was a component of n-octyl-n-decyl-trimellitate. The presence or absence of antibodies could not be correlated with the presence or absence of symptoms; however, the highest incidence of symptoms occurred in workers who were classified as having the highest exposures. It was noted that trimellitic anhydride is not known to be present at the facility. The source of the trimellitic anhydride response is not known. It was concluded that there is no occupational allergic disease in the worker population. The lack of correlation between the antibody responses and symptoms suggests that an immunologic factor is not the cause of the reported symptoms. The symptoms are more likely to be due to irritant nonimmunological reactions.",

Groups of 60 mice of each sex were administered 0, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/animal on the same schedule for 103 weeks. None of the doses selected had produced ulceration of skin in 13 week studies. ... In general, the body weights and survival were lower in mid and high dose groups than in vehicle controls. The survival was lower in exposed groups, primarily because of neoplasms (survival at week 105 male rats: vehicle control, 7/50; low dose, 8/50; high dose, 4/50; female rats: 27/50; 23/50; 15/50; male mice; vehicle control 38/50; low dose, 35/50; mid dose, 4/50; high dose, 0/50; female mice; 30/50; 15/50; 0/50). All high dose male mice died by week 83; the 10 surviving high dose female mice were killed during week 85. ... Acanthosis and sebaceous gland hypertrophy of skin from the scapula or back were observed at substantially increased incidences in exposed male and female rats. Squamous cell papillomas in male rats and squamous cell carcinomas in male and female rats were observed only in exposed rats (squamous cell carcinomas--male: vehicle control 0/50; low dose 33/50; high dose, 36/50; female: 0/50; 16/50). The incidences of basal celladenomas or carcinomas (combined) were increased (male: 0/50; 1/50; 6/50; female: 0/50; 3/50; 4/50). ... For exposed mice, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and necrotizing inflammation of the skin were observed over the scapula or back. Squamous cell carcinomas were found only in exposed mice (male: vehicle control, 0/50; low dose, 14/50; mid dose, 39/50; high dose, 42/50; female: 0/50; 6/50; 37/50; 41/50). ... Follicular atrophy and tubular hyperplasia of the ovary in female mice were increased (atrophy: 12/50; 43/49; 42/49; 47/50; tubular hyperplasia: 5/50; 35/49; 34/50). Mid and high dose females had benign or malignant granulosa cell tumors (0/50; 0/49; 7/49; 12/50) and benign mixed tumors (0/50; 0/49; 11/49; 6/50). The combined incidences of luteomas, granulosa cell tumors benign mixed tumors, or malignant granulosa cell tumors in mid and high dose female mice were increased (1/50; 0/49; 17/49; 18/50). The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in exposed female mice were marginally increased (4/50; 9/50; 11/50; 7/50). ... Under the conditions of these 2 year dermal studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide for male and female F344/N rats as shown by squamous cell and basal cell neoplasms of the skin. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 4-vinyl-1- cyclohexene diepoxide for male and female B6C3F1 mice, as shown by squamous cell carcinomas of the skin in males and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and ovarian neoplasms in females; increased incidences of lung neoplasms in females may also have been related to chemical application.",

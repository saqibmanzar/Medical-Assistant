When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This colorless liquid may exert its strong irritant properties upon dermal contact or inhalation. Avoid breathing vapor. This may necessitate wearing a full-face mask self-contained breathing apparatus. Boots, and protective gloves are recommended; particularly when handling broken packages of this substance. Wash away any material which may have contacted the body with copious amounts of water. While this substance must be moderately heated before ignition occurs (flash point 140 \u00b0F, open cup), 4-chlorotoluene is nevertheless considered a combustion hazard. For fires involving 4-chlorotoluene, extinguish with \"alcohol foam\", CO2, dry chemical, or water in flooding quantities as fog (solid streams may be inefective). Flooding quantities of water also should be applied, from as far a distance as possible, to cool affected containers. This substance should be stored away from sparks, flames, and other sources of ignition. Shipping regulations and other DOT regulatory requirements should be consulted before transport. For small spills of 4-chlorotoluene, take up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and place into containers for later disposal. For large spills, dike to prevent 4-chlorotoluene from entering water sources and sewers. Use water spray to knock down vapor. Before implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge) consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The intended effect of these standards is to require all newly constructed, modified, and reconstructed SOCMI process units to use the best demonstrated system of continuous emission reduction for equipment leaks of VOC, considering costs, non air quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements. p-Chlorotoluene is produced, as an intermediate or final product, by process units covered under this subpart.

Increases in alkaline phosphatase and creatinine (males only), and increases in adrenal (absolute and relative, females), kidney (relative, both sexes), and liver (relative, both sexes) weights were also noted.

The parameters studied included survival, embryo- hatchability and growth. From these effect parameters and the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (Poct) high quality quantitative structure-activity relationships could be derived. The aniline derivatives appeared to have a higher toxicity than the chlorobenzenes, which have a nonspecific (narcotic) mode of toxic action. For the narcotizing chemicals long-term 28-day early life stage toxicity could be accurately predicted on the basis of short-term (7-day) experiments. For the anilines, which are assumed to exert their toxic effects after metabolic activation, the predictions for long-term toxicity on the basis of short-term experiments were found to be inaccurate. For these chemicals it seems necessary either to include detailed microscopic observations for sublethal effects or to prolong the exposure period for the free-feeding larval stages. Differences in sensitivity between B. rerio (this study) and fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas (data reported in literature) were found to be small. A quantitative structure activity relationship for early life stage-toxicity for 30 narcotizing chemicals for the two species was derived. Available data on the acute toxicity of guppy Poecilia reticulata show that for chemicals with a nonspecific mode of toxic action the mean 'acute/chronic' toxicity ratio is approximately 15.",

Equilibrium partitioning theory was used to derive no effect levels for aquatic sediments and internal toxicant concentrations for aquatic organisms. A simple table is given from which no effect levels for narcotic chemicals for water, sediment, and residues in biota can be predicted on the basis of only the octanol/water partition coefficient and molecular weight. The method may be applied to setting quality criteria for the aquatic environment and to ecotoxicological interpretation of (bio)monitoring data. Calculations were carried out for 102 narcotic compounds.",

If released to the atmosphere, 4-chlorotoluene should exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere based on a measured vapor pressure of 2.79 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 4-chlorotoluene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 9 days. An estimated Koc of 340 suggests that 4-chlorotoluene may have moderate mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Based on limited data, 4-chlorotoluene may biodegrade aerobically under some conditions. 4-Chlorotoluene at 20 mg/l, was 44% and 64% biodegraded in three days using a river water and a seawater inoculum, respectively. However, at 100 ppm, 4-chlorotoluene showed only 0-<30% biodegradation in 14 days using an activated sludge inoculum. An isolated strain of Pseudomonas putida 39/D, oxidized 4-chlorotoluene to (+)-cis-4-chloro-2,3-dihydroxy-1-methylcyclohexa-4,6-diene; 4-chlorotoluene is metabolized via cis-dihydrodiol. 4-Chlorotoluene may adsorb to suspended matter in the water based on its estimated Koc value. This compound should volatilize from water surfaces given its Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. BCF values from 14 to 101.6, measured in carp, indicate that 4-chlorotoluene may bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. The most probable route of human exposure to 4-chlorotoluene is inhalation of contaminated air. Segments of the population may also be exposed to 4-chlorotoluene through the ingestion of contaminated drinking water. (SRC)",

Volatilization of 4-chlorotoluene may be important from moist soil surfaces(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), determined from experimental values for vapor pressure(4) and water solubility(2), and from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based on an experimental vapor pressure of 2.79 mm Hg(SRC), determined from experimentally-derived coefficients(4). Based on limited data, 4-chlorotoluene may biodegrade aerobically in soil under some conditions(SRC). 4-Chlorotoluene at 20 mg/l, was 44% and 64% biodegraded in three days using a river water and a seawater inoculum, respectively(5). However, at 100 ppm, 4-chlorotoluene showed only 0(6)-<30%(7) biodegradation in 14 days using an activated sludge inoculum. An isolated strain of Pseudomonas putida 39/D, oxidized 4-chlorotoluene to (+)-cis-4-chloro-2,3-dihydroxy-1-methylcyclohexa-4,6-diene(8); 4-chlorotoluene is metabolized via cis-dihydrodiol(9).",

Based on limited data, 4-chlorotoluene may biodegrade aerobically in water under some conditions(SRC). 4-Chlorotoluene at 20 mg/l, was 44% and 64% biodegraded in three days using a river water and a seawater inoculum, respectively(3). However, at 100 ppm, 4-chlorotoluene showed only 0(4)-<30%(5) biodegradation in 14 days using an activated sludge inoculum. An isolated strain of Pseudomonas putida 39/D, oxidized p-chlorotoluene to (+)-cis-4-chloro-2,3-dihydroxy-1-methylcyclohexa-4,6-diene(6); p-chlorotoluene is metabolized via cis-dihydrodiol(7). 4-Chlorotoluene should volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values for vapor pressure(8) and water solubility(2). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively(1,SRC). BCF values from 14 to 101.6(4), measured in carp, indicate that 4-chlorotoluene may moderately bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC), according to a recommended classification scheme(9). Based on monitoring data from the River Rhine, the half-life of 4-chlorotoluene in a river 4-5 m deep during mid-summer was estimated to be 1.2 days(10).",

Reaction of 4-chlorotoluene with free-radical oxidants found in natural waters is not an environmentally important fate process(1,2). When exposed to UV light at wavelengths about 300 nm, 4-chlorotoluene, in deaerated methanol solution, underwent 2.9% degradation in 48 hours(3). Under the same conditions with acetone added as a photosensitizer, 4-chlorotoluene underwent 54.5% degradation in 9 hours(3). Of the 4-chlorotoluene degraded in this latter study, 52% was converted into toluene(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 4-chlorotoluene with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated as 1.8X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) using a structure estimation method(4,SRC). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 9 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(4,SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

During first cleavage in Ilyanassa obsoleta embryos, a transitory polar lobe constriction forms and then relaxes, allowing the polar lobe to merge with one daughter cell. If the polar lobe is equally divided or removed, morphogenesis is severely disrupted. To examine microtuble locations during early Ilyanassa development, eggs were fixed and stained for polymerized alpha-tubulin during first cleavage. The mitotic apparatus assembles at the animal pole. The cleavage furrow forms between the asters, constricting to a stabilized intercellular bridge encircling midbody-bound microtubules, whereas the polar lobe constriction forms below and parallel to the spindle, constricting to a transitory intercellular bridge encircling no detectable microtubules. At metaphase an alpha-tubulin epitope is distributed throughout the spindle, whereas a beta-tubulin epitope is present predominantly in the asters. Incubation in hexylene glycol, a drug that increases microtubule polymerization, during mitosis causes the polar lobe constriction to tighten around polymerized alpha-tubulin and remain stably constricted. If hexylene glycol is removed, alpha-tubulin staining disappears from the polar lobe constriction, which relaxes, whereas microtubules remain in the cleavage furrow, which remains constricted. These observations suggest that asymmetric distribution of microtubules affects early Ilyanassa cleavage patterns, and that continued presence of microtubules extending through an intercellular bridge is important for stabilization of the bridge constriction prior to completion of cytokinesis. These data provide the basis for further analysis of the role of microtubules in possible microgravity disruptions of Ilyanassa development.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. 2-Methyl-2,4-pentanediol is found on List C. Case No: 3075; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): 2-Methyl-2,4-pentanediol; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Five human subjects given oral doses of 37 g of hexylene glycol daily for 24 days (estimated daily dosage 14-28 mg/kg body weight) reported no subjective symptoms that could be attributed to the intake of hexylene glycol; no alterations in urine parameters were detected. In another study, most subjects exposed for 15 min to 50 ppm of hexylene glycol in the air were able to detect the odor and a few noted eye irritation. At a concentration of 100 ppm, the odor was plain and some noted nasal irritation and respiratory discomfort. At 1000 ppm (4840 mg/cu m), there was irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and respiratory discomfort. Additionally, a case of severe contact urticaria with systemic involvement resembling an anaphylactic reaction, following the application of a topical corticosteroid formulated with hexylene glycol as an excipient has been reported. Swelling and redness were seen in 23 out of 823 eczema patients who were treated with a 30% or 50% aqueous solution in a 48-hr covered patch test. ANIMAL TOXICITY STUDIES: The clinical signs observed in animals acutely intoxicated with hexylene glycol are predominately of central nervous system (CNS) depression and include decreased activity, muscle incoordination and flaccidity, palpebral closure, piloerection, narcosis and anesthesia. Mice were fed hexylene glycol orally 20 mg/day in 2 mL of whole milk for up to 81 days and only minor effects were found in the kidneys of a few animals. None of the rats that were fed hexylene glycol in milk for 4 months at the average rate of 98 and 150 mg/day showed adverse effects in growth nor were there histopathologic changes in the liver and testes, but there were minor changes in the kidneys. It was also shown that approximately 40% of the hexylene glycol was accounted for in the urine, but only 4% of the amount excreted was free glycol; the other 36% was conjugated with glycuronic acid.  In another study, hexylene glycol was administered by oral gavage for 90 days to Sprague Dawley rats at dose levels of 50, 150 and 450 mg/kg/day. This study included a functional observational battery (FOB), which gave no evidence of neurotoxic effects. Hepatocellular hypertrophy coupled with increased liver weight was observed at 450 mg/kg/day in both sexes and in males only at 150 mg/kg/day. In the absence of degenerative or necrotic change this was considered an adaptive response to increased metabolic demand. At 150 and 450 mg/kg/day kidney histopathology (higher incidence and severity of acidophilic globules in the tubular epithelium) and increased kidney weights observed in male rats only are suggestive of male rat specific alpha-2-microglobulin nephropathy, which was subsequently confirmed. There were no adverse effects on other organs including the reproductive organs. The fertility of male rats given an average oral dose of 148 to 190 mg/day of hexylene glycol for 130 days was unchanged when compared to that of the control group. Developmental study in rats found increased pup mortality and reduced body weight gain at 1000 mg/kg/day. Hexylene glycol produced negative Ames test results for Salmonella Typhimurium TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 1538, TA 98, TA 100 with and without activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Aquatic toxicity was evaluated in the sea urchin embryo (Arbacia punctulata) by the inhibition of tritiated thymidine incorporation after a brief exposure to toxic chemicals. In preliminary trials, using compounds including hexylene glycol, results accurately predicted reduced survival and morphological delay after 48 hr exposures.",

Swelling and redness were seen in 23 out of 823 (2.8%) eczema patients who were treated with a 30% or 50% aqueous solution in a 48-hr covered patch test. In 48-hr covered patch tests, two of 23 eczema patients reacted to a 1% aqueous solution. As this concentration was substantially lower than that at which healthy subjects or eczema patients generally experience irritation, it was suspected that these two patients might be showing allergic reactions. However, neither reacted to twice daily uncovered exposures to hexylene glycol (5% in one patient, 30% in the other) for 7 days. Another patient who had responded strongly to a 48-hr covered patch test with 50% aqueous hexylene glycol also reacted to repeated applications of a 30% aqueous solution. The investigators were unable to draw firm conclusions as to the nature of the reactions in these three patients. In patch tests with dilution series, 2 patients reacted to 1% HG, but in both cases ROAT with HG rernained negative. One other patient with a 3+ patch test reaction to 50% HG had a positive ROAT result to 30% HG in water. HG did not increase transepidermal water loss both in atopic normal-looking skin and among healthy controls. The present results suggest that HG is less irritating than PG under occlusion, but that delayed contact allergic reactions may occur. Swelling and redness were seen in 23 out of 823 eczema patients who were treated with a 30% or 50% aqueous solution in a 48-hr covered patch test.",

Three of the antibodies, D2D6, DM1B, and YL1/2, were specific for spindle microtubules, astral microtubules and reactive with both microtubules, respectively. The mitotic sea urchin egg was treated with microtubule depolymerizing (colcemid and nocodazole) and stabilizing (hexylene glycol) drugs and change in the heterogeneous distribution of the tubulin isotypes was investigated by the immunofluorescence procedure using these three monoclonal anti-tubulin antibodies. /It was/ observed that: the microtubule depolymerizing drugs caused quick depolymerization of most mitotic microtubules, and a small number of spindle microtubules remaining were stained with all three antibodies; hexylene glycol induced many microtubules in the mitotic apparatus, which was stained with D2D6 but was not stained with DM1B; hexylene glycol also induced a great number of miniasters in the cytoplasm, and they were stained with three antibodies. These results suggest that these drugs altered the distribution of tubulin isotypes in the mitotic microtubules during depolymerization or polymerization within a short time.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7.0X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 hrs. 2-Methyl-2,4-pentanediol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Methyl-2,4-pentanediol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 55.7% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol via ingestion of some apples. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. (SRC)",

In BOD dilution tests using sewage inoculum, theoretical BODs of 2, 29, 47, and 48% were observed over respective periods of 5, 10, 15 and 20 days in unacclimated medium(2); in acclimated medium, respective theoretical BODs of 55, 85, 88 and 90% were observed(2). Using laboratory-scale model river system, it was demonstrated that microorganisms acclimated to 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol degraded the chemical more rapidly than non-acclimated microbes(3); in non-acclimated conditions, roughly 75% degradation occurred in 15-days while similar degradation required only 5-days in acclimated conditions(2).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.

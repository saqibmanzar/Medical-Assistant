Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid and kill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment. (L795)",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Carbamates form unstable complexes with chlolinesterases by carbamoylation of the active sites of the enzymes.  This inhibition is reversible. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholine esterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholine esterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses.  Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Chronically high (>10 years) exposure leads to neuropsychological consequences including disturbances in perception and visuo-motor processing (A15321).",

For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

Groups of 18 animals per sex (18/sex) received isolan (commercial grade) by the oral route of exposure at the maximum tolerated dose of 0.0215 mg/kg/day. Seven-day-old mice received 0.0215 mg/kg isolan in a gelatin by stomach tube for three weeks. After 3 weeks, animals were administered 0.0603 ppm isolan (equivalent dosage of 0.0215 mg/kg/day) mixed in the feed until study termination at 78 weeks. These administrations may not have represented the MTD for adults because no adjustments were made for body weight changes during the study. Tumor types and incidences observed in male B6C3F1 mice were: type A reticulum cell sarcomas (2/18), pulmonary adenomas (3/18), and hepatomas (1/18). Tumor types and incidences in male control B6C3F1 mice (22 mice [23 tumors] of 79 control mice) were reticulum cell sarcoma (5), pulmonary adenoma (5), hepatoma (8), and other tumor types (5). No tumors were observed in female B6C3F1 mice fed isolan, whereas female control B6C3F1 mice (8 mice [8 tumors] of 87 control mice) exhibited tumor types and incidences as follows: reticulum cell sarcoma (4), pulmonary adenoma (3), and other tumor types (1). Tumors observed in male B6AKF1 mice were pulmonary adenomas (3/18) and hepatomas (2/18). Type A reticulum cell sarcomas were identified in 2 of the 16 female B6AKF1 mice necropsied. Tumor types and incidences identified in the male control B6AKF1 mice (16 animals [17 tumors] of 90 control mice) were 1 reticulum cell sarcoma, 9 pulmonary adenomas, 5 hepatomas, 1 pulmonary carcinoma, and 1 other tumor. The female control B6AKF1 mice (7 mice [9 tumors] of 82 controls) displayed 1 malignant lymphoma with leukemia, 3 reticulum cell sarcomas, 3 pulmonary adenomas, 1 hepatoma, and 1 mammary carcinoma. The incidence of specific tumor types in both sexes of either strain did not differ significantly from controls.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.3X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isolan will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase isolan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours. Isolan does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isolan is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 115. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Based on limited studies isolan does not appear to biodegrade in soil or water. If released into water, isolan is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process; however this compound is hydrolyzed by concentrated acids or alkali. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since isolan is no longer produced or used in the US. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

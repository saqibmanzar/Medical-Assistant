Although administered as a racemic mixture, only the S(+) enantiomer is pharmacologically active.  It was first introduced as an antiepileptic agent in the United Kingdom in 1989 and was used extensively until 1997, when an association with vision loss became apparent. Its use is now generally reserved for patients who have failed alternative therapies, and its US approval by the FDA in 2009 mandated the creation of a drug registry to monitor patients for visual deficits.",

(From Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 31st ed)It is believed that vigabatrin increases brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, by irreversibly inhibiting enzymes that catabolize GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase GABA-T) or block the reuptake of GABA into glia and nerve endings. Vigabatrin may also work by suppressing repetitive neuronal firing through inhibition of voltage-sensitive sodium channels.",

Sabril can cause permanent bilateral concentric visual field constriction, including tunnel vision that can result in disability. In some cases, Sabril also can damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. The onset of vision loss from Sabril is unpredictable, and can occur within weeks of starting treatment or sooner, or at any time after starting treatment, even after months or years. Symptoms of vision loss from Sabril are unlikely to be recognized by patients or caregivers before vision loss is severe. Vision loss of milder severity, while often unrecognized by the patient or caregiver, can still adversely affect function. The risk of vision loss increases with increasing dose and cumulative exposure, but there is no dose or exposure known to be free of risk of vision loss. Vision assessment is recommended at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting Sabril), at least every 3 months during therapy, and about 3 to 6 months after the discontinuation of therapy. Once detected, vision loss due to Sabril is not reversible. It is expected that, even with frequent monitoring, some patients will develop severe vision loss. Consider drug discontinuation, balancing benefit and risk, if visual loss is documented. Risk of new or worsening vision loss continues as long as Sabril is used.  It is possible that vision loss can worsen despite discontinuation of Sabril. Because of the risk of vision loss, Sabril should be withdrawn from patients with refractory complex partial seizures who fail to show substantial clinical benefit within 3 months of initiation and within 2-4 weeks of initiation for patients with infantile spasms, or sooner if treatment failure becomes obvious. Patient response to and continued need for Sabril should be periodically reassessed. Sabril should not be used in patients with, or at high risk of, other types of irreversible vision loss unless the benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the risks. Sabril should not be used with other drugs associated with serious adverse ophthalmic effects such as retinopathy or glaucoma unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Use the lowest dosage and shortest exposure to Sabril consistent with clinical objectives. Because of the risk of permanent vision loss, Sabril is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Vigabatrin REMS Program",

Based on clinical studies in adults, bilateral concentric visual field constriction ranging in severity from mild to severe may occur in 30% or more of patients receiving the drug. Severe cases may be characterized by tunnel vision to within 10 degrees of visual fixation, which can lead to disability. In some cases, vigabatrin can also damage the central retina and decrease visual acuity. Because vision assessment may be difficult in infants and children, the frequency and extent of vision loss is poorly characterized in such patients; therefore, the understanding of the risk is mainly based on adult experience with the drug. The possibility that vigabatrin-induced vision loss may be more common, more severe, or have more functional consequences in infants and children than in adults cannot be excluded.",

In addition, vision loss may develop or worsen precipitously between vision assessments. Symptoms of vigabatrin-associated vision loss are unlikely to be recognized by patients or caregivers before the impairment is severe. Vision loss of milder severity that is often unrecognized by the patient or caregiver can still adversely affect function. Once detected, vigabatrin-induced visual field defects are irreversible and will not improve even after the drug is discontinued. In addition, it is possible that further impairment of vision may occur following drug discontinuance. Risk of vision loss increases with increasing dosages and cumulative exposure to vigabatrin; however, no dosage or exposure to the drug is known to be free of the risk of vision loss. Some studies have suggested that smoking, age, and male gender are possible risk factors for developing visual field defects.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

This review gives a current status on the transporter(s) mediating the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties of the anti-epileptic drug substance vigabatrin. For orally administered drugs, like vigabatrin, the absorption from the intestine is a prerequisite for the bioavailability. Therefore, transporter(s) involved in the intestinal absorption of vigabatrin in vitro and in vivo are discussed in detail. Special focus is on the contribution of the proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1) for intestinal vigabatrin absorption. Furthermore, the review gives an overview of the pharmacokinetic parameters of vigabatrin across different species and drug-food and drug-drug interactions involving vigabatrin.",

Severe TBI patients (n = 10) received VGB (0.5 g enterally, every 12 hr). Each patient had a cerebral microdialysis catheter; two patients had a second catheter in a different region of the brain. Plasma samples were collected 0.5 hr before and 2, 4 and 11.5 hr after the first VGB dose. Cerebral microdialysis commenced before the first VGB dose and continued through at least three doses of VGB. Controls were seven severe TBI patients with microdialysis, without VGB. After the first VGB dose, the maximum concentration of VGB (Cmax) was 31.7 (26.9-42.6) umol/L (median and interquartile range for eight patients) in plasma and 2.41 (2.03-5.94) umol/L in brain microdialysates (nine patients, 11 catheters), without significant plasma-brain correlation. After three doses, median Cmax in microdialysates increased to 5.22 (4.24-7.14) umol/L (eight patients, 10 catheters). Microdialysate VGB concentrations were higher close to focal lesions than in distant sites. Microdialysate GABA concentrations increased modestly in some of the patients after VGB administration. Vigabatrin, given enterally to severe TBI patients, crosses the blood-brain barrier into the brain extracellular fluid, where it accumulates with multiple dosing. Pharmacokinetics suggest delayed uptake from the blood.",

The PK model was used to investigate whether vigabatrin absorption was carrier-mediated and if the proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1) was involved in the absorption processes. Vigabatrin (0.3-300 mg/kg) was administered orally or intravenously to Sprague Dawley rats in the absence or presence of PAT1-ligands l-proline, l-tryptophan or sarcosine. The PK profiles of vigabatrin were described by mechanistic non-linear mixed effects modelling, evaluating PAT1-ligands as covariates on the PK parameters with a full covariate modelling approach. The oral absorption of vigabatrin was adequately described by a Michaelis-Menten type saturable absorption. Using a Michaelis constant of 32.8 mM, the model estimated a maximal oral absorption rate (Vmax) of 64.6mmol/min and dose-dependent bioavailability with a maximum of 60.9%. Bioavailability was 58.5-60.8% at 0.3-30 mg/kg doses, but decreased to 46.8% at 300 mg/kg. Changes in oral vigabatrin PK after co-administration with PAT1-ligands was explained by significant increases in the apparent Michaelis constant. Based on the mechanistic model, a high capacity low affinity carrier is proposed to be involved in intestinal vigabatrin absorption. PAT1-ligands increased the Michaelis constant of vigabatrin after oral co-administration indicating that this carrier could be PAT1.",

Vigabatrin is commercially available as a racemic mixture of 2 enantiomers; the S enantiomer is pharmacologically active and the R enantiomer is inactive.",

Vigabatrin is commercially available as a racemic mixture of 2 enantiomers; the S enantiomer is pharmacologically active and the R enantiomer is inactive. HUMAN STUDIES: Visual field defects, including permanent vision loss, have been reported in infants, children, and adults receiving vigabatrin. Based on clinical studies in adults, bilateral concentric visual field constriction ranging in severity from mild to severe may occur in 30% or more of patients receiving the drug. Severe cases may be characterized by tunnel vision to within 10 degrees of visual fixation, which can lead to disability. In some cases, vigabatrin can also damage the central retina and decrease visual acuity. Coma, unconsciousness, and/or drowsiness were described in the majority of cases of vigabatrin overdose. Other less commonly reported symptoms included vertigo, psychosis, apnea or respiratory depression, bradycardia, agitation, irritability, confusion, headache, hypotension, abnormal behavior, increased seizure activity, status epilepticus, and speech disorder. These symptoms resolved with supportive care. ANIMAL STUDIES: Vigabatrin showed no carcinogenic potential in mouse or rat when given in the diet at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day for 18 months (mouse) or at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day for 2 years (rat). Vigabatrin (300 or 450 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to a mutant mouse strain on a single day during organogenesis (day 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12). An increase in malformations (including cleft palate) was observed at both doses. In rats, oral administration of vigabatrin (50, 100, or 150 mg/kg) throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights and increased incidences of fetal anatomic variations. Oral administration of vigabatrin (50, 100, 150 mg/kg) to rats from the latter part of pregnancy through weaning produced long-term neurohistopathological (hippocampal vacuolation) and neurobehavioral (convulsions) abnormalities in the offspring. Administration of vigabatrin (oral doses of 50 to 200 mg/kg) to pregnant rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis was associated with an increased incidence of malformations (cleft palate) and embryo-fetal death; these findings were observed in two separate studies. No adverse effects on male or female fertility were observed in rats at oral doses up to 150 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of vigabatrin (5, 15, or 50 mg/kg) to young rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development (postnatal days 4-65) produced neurobehavioral (convulsions, neuromotor impairment, learning deficits) and neurohistopathological (brain vacuolation, decreased myelination, and retinal dysplasia) abnormalities in treated animals. The early postnatal period in rats is generally thought to correspond to late pregnancy in humans in terms of brain development. Vigabatrin was negative in in vitro (Ames, CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation, chromosomal aberration in rat lymphocytes) and in in vivo (mouse bone marrow micronucleus) assays.",

In some instances, markedly raised serum ALT levels were found to rapidly fall into the normal range with treatment. Vigabatrin inhibits GABA transaminase and is thus suspected of also being an inhibitor of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, accounting for its unusual effects on liver associated enzymes. In prelicensure clinical trials, there were no reports of serum enzyme elevations during treatment and no instances of clinically apparent liver injury. After its general availability, however, there have been isolated case reports of severe liver injury and hepatitis associated with vigabatrin use. The onset of injury was 3 to 10 months after starting vigabatrin and was largely hepatocellular. One case resulted in rapid death from liver failure and a second worsened despite stopping and ultimately required a course of immunosuppression with prednisone and azathioprine (Case 1). Thus, clinically apparent liver injury from vigabatrin may occur and can be severe, but is rare.",

Based on clinical studies in adults, bilateral concentric visual field constriction ranging in severity from mild to severe may occur in 30% or more of patients receiving the drug. Severe cases may be characterized by tunnel vision to within 10 degrees of visual fixation, which can lead to disability. In some cases, vigabatrin can also damage the central retina and decrease visual acuity. Because vision assessment may be difficult in infants and children, the frequency and extent of vision loss is poorly characterized in such patients; therefore, the understanding of the risk is mainly based on adult experience with the drug. The possibility that vigabatrin-induced vision loss may be more common, more severe, or have more functional consequences in infants and children than in adults cannot be excluded.",

Contrary to the reported unfavorable effect of classic antiepileptic drugs on bone metabolism, little is known about the effect of the next generation antiepileptics on bone remodeling. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of vigabatrin, as a representative of new antiepileptics, on the skeletal system of young rats, in comparison with conventional drugs--phenytoin and valproic acid. The experiments were carried out on 4-week-old male Wistar rats, divided into the control rats, and rats receiving vigabatrin (250 mg/kg p.o. daily), phenytoin (20 mg/kg p.o. daily) or valproic acid (250 mg/kg p.o. daily). The drugs were administered for 28 days. Histomorphometric parameters of the tibia and femur, mechanical properties of the femur, and bone length, diameter, mass, content of mineral substances and calcium were examined. After administration of phenytoin or valproic acid, the investigated bone parameters did not significantly differ from those observed in the control rats. Administration of vigabatrin caused profound impairment of bone accrual with impairment of bone histomorphometric parameters, along with the significant decrease in the body mass gain.",

Since patients suffering from epilepsy may become pregnant, it is important to understand the extent of placental transfer of such medication. During steady-state, vigabatrin enantiomer concentrations were measured in maternal and umbilical blood and in breast milk of two patients. The concentration ratios from the umbilical vein to maternal plasma were R:0.068, S:0.16; 4 hr 25 min after drug administration (case 1) and R: 1.39, S: 0.91; 9h after drug administration (case 2). The milk: plasma concentration ratio was lower than 1 at pre dose sampling in both cases, as well as 3 and 6 h post dose in one case. An estimate of the maximum amount of R and S enantiomers of vigabatrin that a suckling infant would ingest in a day is 3.6% and 1% of the weight-adjusted daily dose respectively. These results would suggest a slow placental transfer of the vigabatrin enantiomers and that the quantity ingested through milk is small.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Three invertebrate species are exposed to commercially available diphacinone-fortified bait used for rat control. The invertebrate samples are collected, frozen, and shipped to the laboratory. The samples are homogenized after cryogenic freezing. A portion of the homogenized samples are extracted with acidified chloroform-acetone, followed by cleanup with a silica solid-phase extraction column. Diphacinone is detected by UV absorption at 325 nm after separation by the chromatographic system. The method limit of detection (MLOD) for snail and slug samples averaged 0.055 and 0.066 mg/kg, respectively. Diphacinone residues in snail tissue ranges from 0.83 to 2.5 mg/kg for Oxychilus spp. The mean recoveries from snails at 0.20 and 2.0 are 97 +/- 21% and 84 +/- 6%. Diphacinone residues in slug tissue ranges from 1.3 to 4.0 mg/kg for Deroceras laeve and < MLOD to 1.8 mg/kg for Limax maximus, respectively.

After the rodenticides were extracted from homogenized animal liver tissues with methanol-acetonitrile (10/90, v/v), the extracts were subjected to a solid-phase extraction (SPE) process using Oasis HLB cartridges. The IC separation was carried out on an IonPac AS11 analytical column (250 mm x 4.0 mm) using 10% methanol in a gradient of KOH solution at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The objective compounds were ionized by negative ion pneumatically assisted electrospray and detected in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Warfarin was applied as an internal standard (IS) for the compensation of the losses in the course of sample processing and the sensitivity drift of the detector, linear calibration functions were calculated for all analytes. The relative average recoveries of the objective compounds spiked in animal liver tissues were between 83.4 and 104.9%. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.2-1.0 ng/g for them. Within-day and day-to-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 10.4 and 13.3%, respectively. It was confirmed that this method could be used in a toxicological analysis. The coupling of IC to MS provided a new analytical tool to the analysts faced with the requirement of separating and analyzing indandione rodenticides in animal livers.",

Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. 2-Diphacinone, and salts is found on List B.

Drugs that decrease the response to oral anticoagulants:  induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes by barbiturates increases the clearance of oral anticoagulants, which correlates with a decrease in the degree of hypoprothrombinemia. Glutethimide has similar effects. ... Rifampin markedly reduces both the concentrations of drug in the blood and the hypoprothrombinemia produced by oral anticoagulants. Diuretics either have no effect or decrease the response to oral anticoagulants. The latter effect may be due to concentration of clotting factors in plasma subsequent to diuresis, as reported for chlorthalidone and spironolactone. Cholestyramine reduces the hypoprothrombinemia and enhances the plasma clearance of oral anticoagulants by increasing the elimination of unchanged drug in the stool. ... Vitamin C in massive doses reduces the hypoprothrombinemic response of some patients on long-term therapy with oral anticoagulants. /oral anticoagulants/",

Twelve dogs (2 groups of 6) were given 2.5 mg of diphenadione/kg of body weight for 3 days. Dogs were treated with vitamin K1, 2.5 (n = 6) or 5 mg/kg/day (n = 6) SC for 21 days, and their responses were compared. Four nonexposed control dogs were given 5 mg of vitamin K1/kg/day. Serum concentration of vitamin K epoxide was significantly (P less than 0.02) higher in diphenadione-exposed dogs than in control dogs 1 to 4 hours after the initial vitamin K1 treatment on day 4. Vitamin K epoxide/vitamin K1 ratios were similarly higher and became more distinct. Cessation of vitamin K1 therapy on day 24 resulted in prolongation of one-stage prothrombin times in diphenadione-exposed dogs, becoming clearly evident on day 27. Serum vitamin K1 concentrations were not detectable on day 27 in diphenadione-exposed dogs, whereas serum vitamin K1 concentrations were readily detectable in control dogs. One-stage prothrombin time changes, during days 24 to 32, indicated 5 mg of vitamin K1/kg provided better protection than did 2.5 mg of vitamin K1/kg. Coagulopathy in the dogs was resolved by day 32.",

For suicidal ingestions with large amounts taken, if there is uncertainty about the amount of bait ingested or the general health of the patient, phytonadione (vitamin K1) given orally protects against the anticoagulant effect of these rodenticides, with essentially no risk to the patient. In accidental ingestions with healthy children involving only a taste or single swallow, no medical treatment is required, but children should be observed for bleeding and bruising. If a larger amount may have been ingested, prothrombin time (PT) should be monitored at 24 and 48 hours, with phytonadione therapy initiated for elevated PT or clinical signs of bleeding. CAUTION: Phytonadione, specificaly, is required. Neither vitamin K3 (menadione, Hykinone) nor vitamin K4 (menadiol) is an antidote for these anticoagulants. /Coumarins and Indandiones/",

The test article was kept in contact with the skin surface for a 6 hr period. After the initial exposure, the test article was administered on alternate days 3 days/wk such that each animal received 10 sensitizing treatments. Following the tenth treatment, animals were rested for 2 weeks, and then given an 11th (challenge) dose. The major problem in this dermal sensitization study was on determining a non-lethal dose level. In the initial assay application of 500 mg caused death and/or severe hemorrhage from the external nares in some animals and evident discomfort in others, with the result that all surviving animals were euthanized. Further testing at doses of 5, 10, 20, 40 or 80 mg with two male guinea pigs/dose resulted in all animals either dying or being euthanized on or about the 7th day after the initial dose. Additional dosing at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.5 mg with two animals/dose resulted in the death of one animal in the 0.5 mg group. As a result, the final dose selected was 2.5 mg in 10 guinea pigs (one of these animals died 13 days after the initial dose). Signs of dermal irritation were not observed in any of the guinea pigs at any dose level during the study, and there were no indications of any sensitization reaction in the survivors of the final assay (dose level: 2.5 mg/animal). There were 3 guinea pigs in a positive control group (each received 2.5 mg/application). One of these positive control animals died before the challenge application, but positive responses were elicited in the remaining 2 guinea pigs. The findings of this study adequately demonstrate that technical diphacinone at a non-lethal exposure level is neither a dermal irritant nor a sensitizer. /Technical diphacinone (96.57%)/",

Modest evidence of internal bleeding was observed at necropsy, although histological examination of heart, liver, kidney, lung, intestine, and skeletal muscle revealed hemorrhage over a wide range of doses (35.1-675 mg/kg). Residue analysis suggests that the half-life of diphacinone in the liver of kestrels that survived was relatively short, with the majority of the dose cleared within 7 days of exposure. Several precise and sensitive clotting assays (prothrombin time, Russell's viper venom time, thrombin clotting time) were adapted for use in this species, and oral administration of diphacinone at 50 mg/kg increased prothrombin time and Russell's viper venom time at 48 and 96 hr postdose compared with controls. Prolongation of in vitro clotting time reflects impaired coagulation complex activity, and generally corresponded with the onset of overt signs of toxicity and lethality. In view of the toxicity and risk evaluation data derived from American kestrels, the involvement of diphacinone in some raptor mortality events, and the paucity of threshold effects data following short-term dietary exposure for birds of prey, additional feeding trials with captive raptors are warranted to characterize more fully the risk of secondary poisoning.",

This action may be offset by expanded use of first-generation compounds (e.g., diphacinone; DPN). Single-day acute oral exposure of adult Eastern screech-owls (Megascops asio) to DPN evoked overt signs of intoxication, coagulopathy, histopathological lesions (e.g., hemorrhage, hepatocellular vacuolation), and/or lethality at doses as low as 130 mg/kg body weight, although there was no dose-response relation. However, this single-day exposure protocol does not mimic the multiple-day field exposures required to cause mortality in rodent pest species and non-target birds and mammals. In 7-day feeding trials, similar toxic effects were observed in owls fed diets containing 2.15, 9.55 or 22.6 ppm DPN, but at a small fraction (<5%) of the acute oral dose. In the dietary trial, the average lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level for prolonged clotting time was 1.68 mg DPN/kg owl/week (0.24 mg/kg owl/day; 0.049 mg/owl/day) and the lowest lethal dose was 5.75 mg DPN/kg owl/week (0.82 mg/kg owl/day). In this feeding trial, DPN concentration in liver ranged from 0.473 to 2.21 ug/g wet weight, and was directly related to the daily and cumulative dose consumed by each owl. A probabilistic risk assessment indicated that daily exposure to as little as 3-5 g of liver from DPN-poisoned rodents for 7 days could result in prolonged clotting time in the endangered Hawaiian short-eared owl (Asio flammeus sandwichensis) and Hawaiian hawk (Buteo solitarius), and daily exposure to greater quantities (9-13 g of liver) could result in low-level mortality. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.03X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diphacinone will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase diphacinone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Diphacinone is rapidly decomposed in water by sunlight and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diphacinone is reported to be immobile based upon a column study. A laboratory study indicated most of the chemical would remain in the top 0-6 cm soil layer of packed columns. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-10 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C. Diphacinone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A biodegradation half-life of 28.3 to 31.7 days when incubated aerobically in sandy loam soils for 3.5 months, suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, diphacinone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon a column study. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-10 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C. An estimated BCF of 76 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Diphacinone is stable at pH 7 and 9; a half-life of 44 days was observed at pH 5. Occupational exposure to diphacinone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diphacinone is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to diphacinone via dermal contact with consumer products containing diphacinone. Wildlife monitoring studies suggest that nontarget species may be exposed to diphacinone and other anticoagulant rodenticides through primary consumption of bait and secondary consumption of poisoned target species.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(2) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-10 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C(3). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 79(SRC), from a log Kow of 4.27(1) and a regression-derived equation(5), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Diphacinone is rapidly decomposed in water by sunlight(1). A biodegradation half-life of 28.3 to 31.7 days when incubated aerobically in sandy loam soils for 3.5 months(1), suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Dibenzyl ether has been identified in tap water and in the Rhine and Niagara Rivers. If released to soil, dibenzyl ether will have slight mobility in soil. Volatilization is not expected from either moist or dry soils. According to a MITI biodegradation test, biodegradation of dibenzyl ether is not expected to be an important fate process in soil or water. However, another study with seawater and river water indicated biodegradation may be rapid. If released to water, dibenzyl ether would adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Dibenzyl ether will be essentially non-volatile from water surfaces. Experimental BCF values of 171-429 and 187-345 suggest that bioconcentration of dibenzyl ether will be high aquatic organisms. If released to the atmosphere dibenzyl ether will exist as a vapor. Vapor-phase dibenzyl ether is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 18 hours. General population may be exposed through the ingestion of foodstuffs and through dermal contact with perfumes that contain dibenzyl ether. General and occupational exposure to ethers, such as dibenzyl ether, can occur through dermal contact, inhalation, and ingestion. (SRC)",

Dibenzyl ether will be essentially non-volatile from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.3X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(3). Experimental BCF values of 171-429 and 187-345(5) suggest that bioconcentrate of dibenzyl ether will be high aquatic organisms(SRC) according to a classification scheme(4). According to a MITI biodegradation test, biodegradation of dibenzyl ether is not expected to be an important fate process in water(5). However, another study with seawater and river water indicated biodegradation may be rapid(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

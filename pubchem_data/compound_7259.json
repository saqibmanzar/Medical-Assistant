For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this colorless to yellow oil or leaf may occur from its use as a chemical intermediate for the production of dyes. Contact with 2,5-xylidine may cause burns to the skin and eyes. Death is also a possible outcome from exposure. While the OSHA PEL is set at a TWA of 5 ppm, the ACGIH lists xylidine (mixed isomers) on its 1988-1989 Notice of Intended Changes with a proposed TLV of 0.5 ppm, and a designation of \"suspected human carcinogen\". In activities or situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus, and full chemical protective clothing which is specifically recommended by the shipper or manufacturer to prevent skin contact with xylidine. If contact should occur, immediately flush the affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. Do not eat or smoke in xylidine work areas. While xylidine does not ignite easily, it can burn with the production of irritating or poisonous gases. Also, containers may explode violently in the heat of a fire. Fires involving xylidine may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, or standard foam. Water spray if used, should be applied with caution because it may cause frothing. Fight the fire from a maximum distance and dike runoff from fire control water. Xylidine should be stored away from heat, strong oxidizers, and hypochlorite bleaches. Shipping regulations and other DOT regulatory requirements should be consulted before transport. If xylidine should spill, dike far ahead, then take up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and place into containers for later disposal. Incineration is a possible form of disposal for xylidine. Before implementing land disposal of waste 2,5-xylidine, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

If released to the atmosphere, 2,5-xylidine should exist mainly in the vapor phase based on a measured vapor pressure of 0.15 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 2,5-xylidine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 2 hours. An estimated Koc value of 240 suggests that 2,5-xylidine may have moderate mobility in soil. However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or soil organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group; therefore, mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization of 2,5-xylidine may be important from moist soil surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.5X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Conflicting results were obtained for the biodegradation of 2,5-xylidene in limited aerobic aqueous screening study data. 2,5-Xylidine reached 0-1% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks and was classified as slow to biodegrade in the Japanese MITI test; in a third screening test a biodegradation rate of 3.6 mg COD/g-hr was reported. In water, 2,5-xylidine may strongly adsorb to suspended organic matter in the water column based on its structure (an aromatic amine). 2,5-Xylidine is expected to volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 120 days, respectively, although adsorption to organic material may attenuate this process. As a class, aromatic amines react relatively rapidly in sunlit natural water via reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and peroxy radicals; typical half-lives for peroxy and hydroxy radical reactions are on the order of 19 and 30 sunlight hours, respectively. The potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is expected to be low based on BCF values ranging from 1.5 to <3.8, measured in carp. Exposure to 2,5-xylidine may occur occupationally during its production or subsequent use. The general population may be exposed through inhalation of tobacco smoke. (SRC)",

Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 120 days, respectively(3,SRC) although adsorption to organic material may attenuate this process(SRC). As a class, aromatic amines react relatively rapidly in sunlit natural water via reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and peroxy radicals(11); typical half-lives for peroxy and hydroxy radical reactions are on the order of 19 and 30 sunlight hours, respectively(11). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values ranging from 1.5-3.8(8), measured in carp, suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

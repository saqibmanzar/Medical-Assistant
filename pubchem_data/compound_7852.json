ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

These volatile nitrogenous amino acid metabolites have been previously demonstrated to stimulate gastrin release in in vivo and in vitro laboratory preparations. ... The present study ... demonstrated that these gastrin-stimulatory volatile amines were present in significant concentrations in breast milk during the first several weeks after parturition and in amniotic fluid. The individual amines that were identified in both human milk and amniotic fluid samples were methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, trimethylamine, propylamine, isobutylamine, and butylamine. This study provides indirect evidence to support the possibility that the hypergastrinemia measured in the fetus/neonate during the period immediately before and after birth may be attributable, in part, to the ingestion of fluid containing high concentrations of gastrin-stimulating amines.",

The irritation effects rapidly reached stable levels. The concentration-response relationships followed Micha\u00eblis-Menten equations. The maximum response decreased with increasing chain length. The concentrations depressing the respiratory rate by 50% (RD-50) were 184, 121, 97, 51, and 27 p.p.m. for n-propylamine, n-butylamine, n-pentylamine, n-hexylamine, and n-heptylamine, respectively. It is suggested that the receptor is activated partly by the amines and partly by hydroxide ions. The nose has a scrubbing effect, which partly protects the lungs against water soluble irritants. Pulmonary irritation was estimated from the decrease in respiratory rate in tracheally cannulated mice. The plateau-level of the response was reached slowly. The respective concentrations depressing the respiratory rate by 50% (tRD-50) were 416, 300, 128, 66, and 36 p.p.m. for the C3-C7 n-amines",

Propylamine is found in various plants, such as tobacco and algae, as a volatile emission product from animal waste, and in various foods. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 310 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase propylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours. Propylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, propylamine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 43. The pKa of propylamine is 10.71, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon its cationic state. propylamine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process in both soil and water, based upon propylamine's biodegradation in aqueous screening tests. If released into water, propylamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation of propylamine is expected to be rapid; a BODT of 102% was measured using a sludge inoculum. A pKa of 10.71 indicates propylamine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to propylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propylamine is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to propylamine via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, use of tobacoo products and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing propylamine.

The pKa of propylamine is 10.71(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization of propylamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process given its cationic state(SRC). Propylamine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 310 mm Hg(6). Biodegradation of propylamine is expected to occur(7-9); a 102% theoretical BOD was measured after 13 days using a non-activated sludge inoculum(7).",

A pKa of 10.71(4) indicates propylamine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation of propylamine is expected to occur(8-10); a 102% of theoretical BOD was measured after 13 days using a non-activated sludge inoculum(8).",

Vapor-phase propylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.3X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Propylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The presence of volatile aliphatic amines ... in human breast milk and amniotic fluid /was measured/ to assess their role in neonatal hypergastrinemia. These volatile nitrogenous amino acid metabolites have been previously demonstrated to stimulate gastrin release in in vivo and in vitro laboratory preparations. ... The present study ... demonstrated that these gastrin-stimulatory volatile amines were present in significant concentrations in breast milk during the first several weeks after parturition and in amniotic fluid. The individual amines that were identified in both human milk and amniotic fluid samples were methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, trimethylamine, propylamine, isobutylamine, and butylamine. This study provides indirect evidence to support the possibility that the hypergastrinemia measured in the fetus/neonate during the period immediately before and after birth may be attributable, in part, to the ingestion of fluid containing high concentrations of gastrin-stimulating amines.",

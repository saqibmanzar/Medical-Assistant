It has been detected in some carbon blacks as well as in particulate exhaust of diesel engines and has been found at low concentrations in ambient air.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Pretreatment of the mice with beta-naphthoflavone enhanced the binding to lung microsomal macromolecules; phenobarbital pretreatment increased the binding to liver microsomes. Incubations were also conducted with lung slices and isolated lung cells. Autoradiographs of the lung slices showed that most of the binding occurred in the epithelial cells of the bronchioles and smaller airways. With the isolated lung cells, there was preferential binding of 1-nitronaphthalene to cell populations enriched in Clara cells. beta-Naphthoflavone pretreatment increased the binding of 1-nitronaphthalene in both the lung slices and isolated lung cells.",

Toxic by inhalation and dermal contact, exposure to this yellow, crystalline substance may occur during its manufacture, from its use as a corrosion inhibitor or as an intermediate in the production of drugs, perfumes, rubber chemicals, tanning agents, rodenticides, 1-naphthylamine, and commercial explosives. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, cyanosis, and anemia. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and personal protective clothing. If contact should occur, immediately flush affected eyes and skin with running water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. 1-Nitronaphthalene may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames, and may proceed rapidly with a flare-burning effect, producing irritating or poisonous gases. For fires involving 1-nitronaphthalene, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, sand, water spray, fog, or standard foam (water and foam should be applied gently with caution because it may cause frothing). Small dry spills of 1-nitronaphthalene may be taken up with a clean shovel and placed into a clean, dry, covered container. Large spills should be wetted down and diked for later disposal. Before implementing land disposal of waste 1-nitronaphthalene, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Skin contamination should be removed promptly by washing with soap and water. Eye contamination should be removed by flushing with copious amounts of clear water.

SRP: /It may be helpful to empty stomach and administer dose of activated charcoal/ Examine the plasma for evidence of hemolysis: a reddish-brown tinge. Examine the blood smear for \"ghosts\" and Heinz bodies. If /hemolysis is/ present, monitor red blood cell count and hematocrit for anemia, urine for protein, and cells. Measure direct- and indirect-reacting bilirubin in the plasma. Monitor fluid balance and blood electrolytes. If possible, monitor urinary excretion of naphthol to assess severity of poisoning and clinical progress. If hemolysis is clinically significnt, administer intravenous fluids to accelerate urinary excretion of the naphthol metabolite and protect the kidney from products of hemolysis. Use Ringer's-lactate or sodium bicarbonate to keep urine pH above 7.5. Consider use of mannitol, or furosemide, to promote diuresis. If urine flow declines, intravenous infusions must be carefully monitored to avoid fluid overload. Institute hemodialysis. Consider charcoal hemoperfusion in tandem to extract naphthalene and end-products. If anemia is severe, blood transfusions may be needed. Hydrocortisone may be of some benefit if significant hemolysis is present. /Fumigant poisoning/",

Treated mice were killed at times from 6 hours to 14 days post-treatment. Tissues were analyzed for cytotoxic effects by optical and electron microscopy, and for cell proliferation by autoradiography following in vitro labeling of lung slices with 3H-thymidine. The naphthalene derivatives varied widely in their cytotoxic effects. The most toxic was 1-nitronaphthalene with no mice surviving doses >1 mmol/kg. ...In all cases the first evidence of cytotoxic effects was seen in the Clara cells of the bronchiolar epithelium, and, at the highest doses, toxic effects were found in the adjacent ciliated cells. Changes could be detected at the ultrastructural level at all doses, and within 6 hours after treatment. Only slight effects were seen in other cell types. Increased cell proliferation following chemical treatment was seen only in the bronchiolar epithelium, among cells tentatively identified as Clara cells or their precursors. Cytotoxic effects of naphthalene and its 1- and 2-methyl derivatives were confined to the lung, with minimal evidence of toxicity in the liver and kidney. The mononitronaphthalenes both produce small areas of centrizonal necrosis in the liver, but no discernible effects in the kidney.",

At 25 mg/kg, only nonciliated cells in minor daughter airways were swollen and necrotic. At 50 mg/kg there was near complete loss of nonciliated cells in most bronchioles, minor daughter airways, and tracheas. Marked damage to ciliated cells was observed at doses of 100 and 150 mg/kg. Denudation of the basement membrane was common in the trachea. We conclude for 1-nitronaphthalene cytotoxicity in the lung that: nonciliated cells of the distal bronchioles are not the only target;  the threshold for injury in nonciliated cells is lower than that for ciliated cells; the response is airway selective; the response is dose-related.",

Within 4 hr of treatment, all 1-nitronaphthalene treated animals exhibited respiratory distress characterized by labored breathing, severe gasping and chromodacryorrhea. The primary ultrastructural alteration were hydropic changes in the non-ciliated bronchiolar (Clara) cells of the distal-most bronchioles of the lung. These were apparent as early as 1 hr after 1-nitronaphthalene injection, while adjacent ciliated cells showed no alterations. Over a 24 hr period, the bronchioles showed progressive ultrastructural changes leading to necrosis and exfoliation of both ciliated and Clara cells. Interstitial pneumonitis and edema were observed in all animals treated with 1-nitronaphthalene, and was usually associated with bronchioles containing necrotic epithelium. In the liver, ultrastructural changes were observed in the centrilobular hepatocytes at 8 hr and consisted of cytomegaly, loss of continuous inner membrane and reduced matrix density of the mitochondria. At 48 hr, cellular damage to centrilobular hepatocytes was severe and nearly all mitochondria were damaged. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin were detected in the serum of animals treated with 1-nitronaphthalene at 8-48 hr.",

Piloerection and respiratory distress were induced in animals treated with 0.5mmol/kg NN within 4 hours. By 24 hours, weight loss was evident and animals were panting. Pulmonary lesions at this time were restricted to the bronchiolar epithelium. Surviving respiratory epithelium was overlaid with a raft of debris consisting of small amounts of fibrin, many damaged epithelial cells, and a few macrophages.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.8X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-nitronaphthalene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-nitronaphthalene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6 days. Particulate-phase 1-nitronaphthalene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Gas-phase photolysis is the major degradation pathway for 1-nitronaphthalene as indicated by a measured photolysis half-life of 0.5 hrs. If released to soil, 1-nitronaphthalene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,295. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.76X10-6 atm-cu m/mole.  A mineralization rate of 0.21 ug/g day-1 after a lag of 4-5 weeks in flooded soil suggests that anaerobic biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 1-nitronaphthalene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 27 and 204 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 57 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1-nitronaphthalene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-nitronaphthalene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-nitronaphthalene via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.76X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 27 and 204 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 57(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

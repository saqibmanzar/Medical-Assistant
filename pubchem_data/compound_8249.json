When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

More specifically, phenformin improves glycemic control by improving insulin sensitivity. Phenformin is generally considered to be associated with an unacceptably high incidence of actic acidosis. In general biguanides should be used only in stable type II diabetics who are free of liver, kidney and cardiovascular problems and who cannot be controlled with diet.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

AMPK is an ultra-sensitive cellular energy sensor that monitors energy consumption and down-regulates ATP-consuming processes when activated. The biguanide phenformin has been shown to independently decrease ion transport processes, influence cellular metabolism and activate AMPK. Phenformin's hypoglycemic activity is related the effect it has in activating AMPK and fooling insulin sensitive cells into thinking that insulin levels are low and causing the body to use glucose as if in a state of low caloric consumption. This drug also seems to inhibit several varients of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (namely the receptor subtype Kir6.1).",

Treatment was followed by a period of observation of 26 wk. Control groups consisted of 15 untreated animals of each species and sex. Average weights attained by treated groups of rats and mice were consistently lower than those of control groups in all tests except that male for male rats, in which case the weights shown by treated and control animals were indistinguishable. Survival was apparently unaffected in both species by treatment with phenformin, but was poor in mice due to intercurrent disease. Tumors appearing in treated rats and mice were similar in type and number to those in controls, and no pathologic or statistical evidence of induction of tumors in these species by phenformin was found.

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

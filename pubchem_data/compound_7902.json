PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

In vitro [(2)H6]deanol was rapidly taken up by rat brain synaptosomes, but was neither methylated nor acetylated. [(2)H6]Deanol was a weak competitive inhibitor of the high affinity transport of [(2)H4]choline, thus reducing the synthesis of [(2)H4]acetylcholine. In vivo [(2)H6]deanol was present in the brain after i.p. or p.o. administration, but was not methylated or acetylated. Treatment of rats with [(2)H6]deanol significantly increased the concentration of choline in the plasma and brain but did not alter the concentration of acetylcholine in the brain. Treatment of rats with atropine (to stimulate acetylcholine turnover) or with hemicholinium-3 (to inhibit the high affinity transport of choline) did not reveal any effect of [(2)H6]deanol on acetylcholine synthesis in vivo. However, since [(2)H6]deanol did increase brain choline, it may prove therapeutically useful when the production of choline is reduced or when the utilization of choline for the synthesis of acetylcholine is impaired.",

In vitro [(2)H6]deanol was rapidly taken up by rat brain synaptosomes, but was neither methylated nor acetylated. [(2)H6]Deanol was a weak competitive inhibitor of the high affinity transport of [(2)H4]choline, thus reducing the synthesis of [(2)H4]acetylcholine. In vivo [(2)H6]deanol was present in the brain after i.p. or p.o. administration, but was not methylated or acetylated. Treatment of rats with [(2)H6]deanol significantly increased the concentration of choline in the plasma and brain but did not alter the concentration of acetylcholine in the brain. Treatment of rats with atropine (to stimulate acetylcholine turnover) or with hemicholinium-3 (to inhibit the high affinity transport of choline) did not reveal any effect of [(2)H6]deanol on acetylcholine synthesis in vivo. However, since [(2)H6]deanol did increase brain choline, it may prove therapeutically useful when the production of choline is reduced or when the utilization of choline for the synthesis of acetylcholine is impaired.",

Here, we show that five recently isolated Methanococcoides strains from a range of sediments (Aarhus Bay, Denmark; Severn Estuary mudflats at Portishead, United Kingdom; Darwin Mud Volcano, Gulf of Cadiz; Napoli mud volcano, eastern Mediterranean) can directly utilize choline for methanogenesis producing ethanolamine, which is not further metabolized. Di- and monomethylethanolamine are metabolic intermediates that temporarily accumulate. Consistent with this, dimethylethanolamine was shown to be another new growth substrate, but monomethylethanolamine was not. The specific methanogen inhibitor 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) inhibited methane production from choline. When choline and trimethylamine are provided together, diauxic growth occurs, with trimethylamine being utilized first, and then after a lag (about 7 days) choline is metabolized. Three type strains of Methanococcoides (M. methylutens, M. burtonii, and M. alaskense), in contrast, did not utilize choline. However, two of them (M. methylutens and M. burtonii) did metabolize dimethylethanolamine. These results extend the known substrates that can be directly utilized by some methanogens, giving them the advantage that they would not be reliant on bacterial syntrophs for their substrate supply.",

It is marketed as a free base or salt, and in theory, the two forms should be equally effective and able to substitute for each other in pharmaceutical formulations. Detecting possible alterations in the active principle is a basic part of preformulation studies. Accordingly, this study compared DMAE and DMAE bitartrate to identify potential alterations or differences between the free base and the salt that might compromise the long-term stability of cosmetic preparations at different temperatures, and also compared the behavior of the base substance and derivative alone and in solution. Samples were analyzed with different physicochemical methods such as differential scanning calorimetry, ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

They neutralize acids to form salts plus water. These acid-base reactions are exothermic.

Amines may be incompatible with isocyanates, halogenated organics, peroxides, phenols (acidic), epoxides, anhydrides, and acid halides. Flammable gaseous hydrogen is generated by amines in combination with strong reducing agents, such as hydrides. This compound may react vigorously with oxidizing materials. (NTP, 1992)",

DMAE has been used as an ingredient in skin care, and in cognitive function- and mood-enhancing products. Deaner(DMAE p-acetamidobenzoate) was a U.S. prescription drug for more than 20 years until 1983 when it was withdrawn from the market. It was used to treat children with learning and behavior problems. A large number of dietary supplements contain DMAE. The predominant form, when specified, is DMAE bitartrate. DMAE has applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Severe respiratory symptoms were observed in a single painter exposed to spray paint containing DMAE. Wheal and flare responses occurred after exposure of human volunteers to DMAE but it was interpreted as an irritant. DMAE tartrate administered orally to humans produced mild mental stimulation. At 20 mg/day, there was a gradual increase in muscle tone and perhaps an increased frequency of convulsions in susceptible individuals. Larger doses produced insomnia, muscle tenseness, and spontaneous muscle twitches. Serious cholinergic side effects were reported in a 37-yr-old woman with tardive dyskinesia who had been taking deanol. However, a single 2500 mg dose taken in a suicide attempt had no adverse effects. ANIMAL STUDIES: Acute clinical signs of rat exposure to DMAE vapor included nasal and ocular irritation, respiratory distress, and body weight loss. In the 13-week study, rats were exposed to 0, 8, 24, or 76 ppm DMAE for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks. The principal exposure-related changes were transient corneal opacity in the 24 and 76 ppm groups; decreased body weight gain for the 76 ppm group; and histopathological lesions of the respiratory and olfactory epithelium of the anterior nasal cavity of the 76 ppm group and of the eye of several 76 ppm group females. DMAE did not induce any neoplasms in mice. In a developmental study in rats there were no effects of DMAE treatment on any gestational parameters, including pre- and post-implantation loss or sex ratio. Fetal body weights per litter were statistically significantly increased at 100 ppm relative to controls. There were no increases in the incidences of total malformations by category (external, visceral or skeletal) or individually. The incidence of six skeletal variations out of 120 noted differed in exposed groups relative to that of control. Four of these variations were decreases in incidence; only one fetal variation, the split (bipartite) cervical centrum, was elevated at 100 ppm relative to controls. DMAE was not genotoxic using the Salmonella/microsome reverse gene mutation test, the CHO/HGPRT forward gene mutation test, a sister chromatid exchange test in cultured CHO cells, and an in vivo peripheral blood micronucleus test in mice.",

In addition, simultaneous treatments with insulin (500 nM) and methylated ethanolamine analogues (1 mM or less) resulted in synergistic activation of DNA synthesis. The order of mitogenic potency of ethanolamine analogues was dimethylethanolamine > monomethylethanolamine > ethanolamine. Choline (1-5 mM) alone had no effect on DNA synthesis, but it increased the combined effects of lower concentrations of ethanolamine analogues and insulin. The synergistic effects of ethanolamine analogues, choline and insulin were considerably (1.7- to 1.9-fold) enhanced by GF 109203X (3 uM), a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C. The results suggest that ethanolamine analogues enhance insulin-induced DNA synthesis by a mechanism which is inhibited by the protein kinase C system.",

A dose of 80 mg of DMAE had no effect on the severity of apomorphine-induced stereotypy. However, 160 mg of DMAE significantly diminished the severity of apomorphine-induced stereotypy. This dose of DMAE did not significantly alter spontaneous locomotor activity. DMAE did not reduced apomorphine-induced stereotypy in animals previously exposed to haloperidol and presumed to have postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity. These results with DMAE are contrasted with the effects of choline chloride, and suggest that choline chloride may be more effective than DMAE at augmenting striatal cholinergic activity.",

This hepatoprotective effect of DMAE depended on the applied dose in rats, but there was no complete protection following the highest dose. Paracetamol-induced depletion of hepatic glutathione (GSH) was not influenced by the simultaneous administration of DMAE in rats and mice. Metabolic disposition of paracetamol in the urine of rats showed an enhanced elimination of free paracetamol and the glucuronide in the DMAE-treated group, whereas the mercapturate excretion remained unchanged. Diminished p-hydroxylation of aniline in a 9000Xg supernatant of rat and mouse liver homogenates in the presence of DMAE indicated an inhibition of microsomal mixed-function oxidase activity, which is also involved in the metabolic activation of paracetamol.",

Workers were exposed to a mixture of DMAE, ethylenediamine, propylene oxide, and 4,4-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate. Severe respiratory symptoms were observed in a single painter exposed to spray paint containing DMAE. Wheal and flare responses occurred after exposure of human volunteers to DMAE (undiluted, and 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions in saline) but were interpreted as an irritant response.

The present 2-phase randomized double-blind split face study was designed to compare the effect of a gel containing 3% 2-dimethylaminoethanol (deanol, DMAE) with the same formulation without DMAE. In a first pilot study, sensorial assessments and measures of the skin distension under suction were performed in eight volunteers. In a second study conducted in 30 volunteers, shear wave propagation was measured. Large interindividual variations precluded any significant finding in the first study. The DMAE formulation showed, however, a significant effect characterized by increased shear wave velocity in the direction where the mechanical anisotropy of skin showed looseness.The DMAE formulation under investigation increased skin firmness.",

Here, we review available data on one such agent - 2-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) or deanol - that has recently been evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial. DMAE is an analog of the B vitamin choline and is a precursor of acetylcholine. Although the role of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter is well known, growing evidence points to acetylcholine as a ubiquitous cytokine-like molecule that regulates basic cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, locomotion, and secretion in a paracrine and autocrine fashion. Indeed, this modulatory role may contribute to the cutaneous activity of DMAE. In a randomized clinical study, 3% DMAE facial gel applied daily for 16 weeks has been shown to be safe and efficacious (p < 0.05) in the mitigation of forehead lines and periorbital fine wrinkles, and in improving lip shape and fullness and the overall appearance of aging skin. These effects did not regress during a 2-week cessation of application. Beneficial trends (p > 0.05 but </= 0.1) were noted in the appearance of coarse wrinkles, under-eye dark circles, nasolabial folds, sagging neck skin, and neck firmness. Application was found to be well tolerated, with no differences in the incidence of erythema, peeling, dryness, itching, burning, or stinging between the DMAE and placebo groups. An open-label extension of the trial showed that the long-term application of DMAE gel for up to 1 year was associated with a good safety profile. The acute skin-firming effects of DMAE have been confirmed by quantitative measures of cutaneous tensile strength.",

Maintenance dose for methylphenidate was 40 mg daily; for deanol, 500 mg. Behavior rating forms, reaction time, and a series of standard psychometric tests were given before and after treatment. Both drugs showed significant improvement on a number of tests; the pattern and degree of change differed slightly for the 2. In this paradigm, deanol thus appeared to improve performance in children with learning and behavior disorders. The mechanism of action remains speculative; proof that deanol increases acetylcholine is scanty, and there is a theoretical basis for actually assuming an anticholinergic effect.",

The principal exposure-related changes were transient corneal opacity in the 24 and 76 ppm groups; decreased body weight gain for the 76 ppm group; and histopathologic lesions of the respiratory and olfactory epithelium of the anterior nasal cavity of the 76 ppm group and of the eye of several 76 ppm group females. Rats maintained for a 5-week recovery period only exhibited histological lesions of the nasal tissue, with the lesions being decreased in incidence and severity. DMEA acts primarily as an ocular and upper respiratory tract irritant and toxicant at vapor concentrations of 76 ppm, while 24 ppm or less produced no biologically significant toxicity in rats.

Stabilizers containing the dimethylaminoethanol moiety (DMAE) have been reported to extend the life-span of drosophila and mice. We tested the prediction in Japanese quail (N = 15) by administering DMAE bitartrate (18.4 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water for 69 weeks, starting at 195 weeks of age. A matched control group (N = 14) received tartaric acid (4.0 mg/kg/day) in the water. Contrary to the prediction, the DMAE-treated group has a shorter life-span after start of treatment (49 weeks) than the controls (69 weeks). No significant differences between the groups were observed in body weight or daily fluid intake. Three behavioral studies were carried out on survivors at 243-249 weeks of age, namely; activity response to light-flash; sexual mounting response to a female quail; and classical conditioning of the heart rate. Aged quail differed from young-adults in changes in motor activity in response to light flashes. Aged quail appeared less responsive initially to reinforced conditioning trials and demonstrated extinction when light flash was not followed by electric shock. There were no detectable differences in latency to mount or in basal heart rate, either as a function of age or as a function of DMAE treatment. /DMAE bitartarate/",

It may also be released directly into the environment as a component of corrosion inhibitor formulations, paints, and surface coatings. 2-Dimethylaminoethanol occurs in salmon, sardines, and anchovies. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.18 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-dimethylaminoethanol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-dimethylaminoethanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.3 hours. Vapor-phase 2-dimethylaminoethanol will also be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.7 days. If released to soil, 2-dimethylaminoethanol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. The pKa of 2-dimethylaminoethanol is 9.3. At pH 8.2, 20% will be the free amine. Thus, this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts. As a result, 2-dimethylaminoethanol may have greater adsorption and less mobility than its estimated Koc value indicates. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Dimethylaminoethanol may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 60.5% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that 2-dimethylaminoethanol is readily biodegradable and that biodegradation is expected to be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 2-dimethylaminoethanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-dimethylaminoethanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-dimethylaminoethanol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-dimethylaminoethanol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and dietary supplements, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 2-dimethylaminoethanol.

The pKa of 2-dimethylaminoethanol is 9.3(3). At pH 8.2, 20% will be the free amine. Thus, this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts(4). As a result, 2-dimethylaminoethanol may have greater adsorption and less mobility than its estimated Koc value indicates. Volatilization of 2-dimethylaminoethanol from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(2). 2-Dimethylaminoethanol may volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 3.18 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5). A 60.5% of theoretical BOD in two weeks using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test indicates that 2-dimethylaminoethanol is readily biodegradable(6) and suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC). Results of another screening test found that 2-dimethylaminoethanol biodegrades readily(7).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of -0.55(5) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A 60.5% of theoretical BOD in two weeks using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test indicates that 2-dimethylaminoethanol is readily biodegradable(6) and suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC). Results of another screening test found that 2-dimethylaminoethanol biodegrades readily(7). 2-Dimethylaminoethanol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The magnitude of dermal exposure was estimated to be 0 to 0.1 mg/sq cm/day with up to 1 mg/sq cm/day for spent catalyst drumming in organic flocculants manufacture. The TWA values for worker exposure in polyether block plants and in hot cure molding plants were up to 60 ppb total amine burden, which is comprised of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane triethylenediamine (DABCO) and 2-dimethylaminoethanol.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

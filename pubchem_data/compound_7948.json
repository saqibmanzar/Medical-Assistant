When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The subjects consisted of 76 exposed workers employed in the tar distillation process and 34 controls. ... Urinary metabolite levels were corrected for specific gravity and creatinine. The time weighted average exposure concentrations in the breathing zones of the tar distillation workers were ... 0.02 to 0.04 mg/cu m for xylenols. ... The urinary xylenol levels of exposed workers ranged from 0.12 to 0.97 mg/l with specific gravity correction. In control urine samples, the specific gravity corrected xylenol concentrations ranged from 25 x 10(-3) to 43 x 10(-3) mg/l. Significant correlations were observed between the ambient levels and urinary concentrations of phenol, o-cresol, and the xylenols, with coefficients ranging from 0.45 to 0.82. The author concludes that the biological monitoring of urinary xylenols may be used as a means of measuring xylenol exposure in coke facility workers.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

In addition, dimethylphenols, of which 3,5-dimethylphenol is an isomer, are present essential oils of various conifers, in tea and in tobacco and tobacco smoke. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.041 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates that 3,5-dimethylphenol will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3,5-dimethylphenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.4 hours. There is potential for the direct photolysis of 3,5-dimethylphenol since a small band extends over 290 nm and thus 3,5-dimethylphenol may absorb light in the environmental UV spectrum. If released to soil, 3,5-dimethylphenol is expected to have low to moderate mobility based upon Koc values ranging from 190-1400. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Complete biodegradation of 3,5-dimethylphenol occurred in 11 days within a hard, carbonaceous woody loam. If released into water, 3,5-dimethylphenol is expected to adsorb very little to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Screening studies indicate that a 31% loss of theoretical oxygen demand was reached after 5 days. In addition, it has been reported that 3,5-dimethylphenol was readily degraded in St. Lawrence River water. Biodegradation under anaerobic conditions failed to occur after 24 days in one study but 45% degradation occurred after 8 weeks in another study. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 30 days and 225 days, respectively. However, the Koc of 1,400 suggests that volatilization could be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediments in water. An estimated BCF of 36 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 3,5-dimethylphenol may occur through inhalation of this compound at workplaces where 3,5-dimethylphenol is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 3,5-dimethylphenol via inhalation of ambient air (i.e., automobile exhaust), ingestion of food, and contact with other products containing 3,5-dimethylphenol.

In 1979 the EPA conducted an investigation of this area. Compound distribution at various areas about the site revealed that, in addition to groundwater leaching of soluble phenolics, insoluble contaminants were spread by a dike-breach incident and subsequent construction activities. Differences in the patterns of chemicals in various wells suggested that more than one source of pollution occurred. The distribution of compounds about the site indicated that a general clean-up would not be cost-effective. Placement of an intereceptor to collect groundwater seepage that contaminated surface water was considered as an alternative. One of the 43 compounds identified in soil extracts was 3,5-dimethylphenol.",

Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 30 days and 225 days, respectively(3,SRC). However, this model underestimates the volatilization half-life of 3,5-dimethylphenol since it does not take into account the effects of adsorption. The Koc of 1,400(2) suggests that volatilization could be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediments in water(SRC). This is apparent from the results of two EXAMS model runs, one in which the effect of adsorption was considered (half-life = 1,900 days in model pond) and one in which adsorption was ignored (half-life = 330 days in model pond)(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 36(3,SRC), from 3,5-dimethylphenol's log Kow(8), suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). In humic waters, degradation by the reaction with peroxy radicals should ensue with a half-life on the order of hours(9). 3,5-Dimethylphenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). Biodegradation screening studies indicate that a 31% loss of theoretical oxygen demand occurred after 5 days(10,11). In addition, it has been reported that 3,5-dimethylphenol was readily degraded in St. Lawrence River water(12). Biodegradation under anaerobic conditions failed to occur after 24 days in one study using a river sediment inoculum(13), yet 45% degradation occurred after 8 weeks in another study using a contaminated groundwater digester(14).",

Vapor-phase 3,5-dimethylphenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.4 hours(SRC) from its rate constant of 1.13X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Atmospheric 3,5-dimethylphenol is known to be removed by rainwater(4). 3,5-Dimethylphenol has an absorption band at 281 nm (cyclohexane), and a shoulder may extend over 290 nm, thus making it a candidate for direct photochemical degradation(5,6). Night-time degradation in urban areas should occur rapidly through reaction with atmospheric nitrate radicals, as rate constants for this reaction with phenolic compounds are approximately 250 times faster than with hydroxyl radicals(7,SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Organisms originally obtained from soil and sewage sites which were adapted to decompose phenol were also found to decompose 3,5-dimethylphenol(3). 3,5-Dimethylphenol degraded completely in 11 days in a hard, carbonaceous woody loam at 19 \u00b0C(4). Using bacteria isolated from the subsurface of a manufactured gas plant in England, 3,5-dimethylphenol degraded in contaminated soil very slowly; the final decrease in concentration varied from 15-18% of the starting concentration of 169.9 mg/l and a first-order half-life was estimated to be 310 days(5).",

In a screening test using a mixed culture sewage seed and substrate concns of 100, 300, and 500 mg/l, anaerobic degradation did not occur(2). However, in another study, 3,5-dimethylphenol, at an initial concn of 6.18 mg/l, underwent 45% degradation when incubated in coal tar-contaminated groundwater in an anaerobic digester for 8 weeks(3). In addition, it was determined that 3,5-dimethylphenol degraded to methane and carbon dioxide in the presence of dilute sewage sludge, time not specified(4) and, although it is the slowest of the dimethylphenol isomers, 3,5-dimethylphenol can biodegrade anaerobically(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3.4 hours at an atmospheric concn of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 3,5-Dimethylphenol has an absorption band at 281 nm (cyclohexane), and a shoulder may extend over 290 nm, thus making it a candidate for direct photochemical degradation(2,3). Night-time degradation in urban areas should occur rapidly through reaction with atmospheric nitrate radicals, as rate constants for this reaction with phenolic compounds are approximately 250 times faster than with hydroxyl radicals(4,SRC). Peroxy radicals found in humic waters react with phenols; the half-lives can be measured in hours(5). 3,5-Dimethylphenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 3,5-dimethylphenol is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as approximately 30 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 225 days(SRC). However, the volatilization half-life does not take into account the effects of adsorption. A Koc of 1,400(4) suggests that volatilization could be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediments in water(SRC). This is apparent from the results of two EXAMS model runs(SRC), one in which the effect of adsorption was considered, yielding an estimated half-life of 1,900 days in a model pond 2 m deep, and one in which the effect of adsorption was ignored, yielding an estimated half-life of 330 days in a model pond 2 m deep(5). 3,5-Dimethylphenol's estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur(SRC). 3,5-Dimethylphenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.041 mm Hg(1).",

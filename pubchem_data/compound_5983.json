When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This includes pKa (the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant) and pKb (the negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

                        "Description": "In medicine, the term \"mechanism of action\" (also called MOA) is used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Since the drug is quite unstable in blood plasma, pyridostigmine bromide was added to the samples to limit the decomposition. Physostigmine was used as an internal standard.

Malaise, mental confusion, convulsions, loss of consciousness, and coma may also be noted. Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Bradycardia (slow heart rate) occurs frequently. Pulmonary edema, dyspnea (shortness of breath), labored breathing, respiratory depression, or respiratory arrest may also occur.",

Peak inhibition of cholinesterase was moderate (65%) at 15 min after the first physostigmine administration. The time course and extent of inhibition of cholinesterase after the first and second administration of physostigmine followed a similar pattern. Fifteen min after the second administration of physostigmine, inhibition of cholinesterase was 60%; the activity recovered to control levels at 120 min. After the first administration of physostigmine, levels of acetylcholine incr by 70%. The peak value of acetylcholine was reached at 15 min. Acetylcholine returned almost to control levels at 60 min after treatment. The incr in the level of acetylcholine in brain seen with the second administration of physostigmine was of the same order and duration as that seen after the first administration.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

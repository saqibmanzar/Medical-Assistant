The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In general, the trihalogenated benzenes increased the LD50 of all 4 insecticides 2- to 6-fold. These increases were larger than those observed with the di- or hexahalogenated isomers. The bromide-substituted benzenes were usually more active than the chlorinated ones with the exception being hexabromobenzene. There was a good correlation between their effects on lethality and increases in in vitro carboxylesterase activity with either-malathion or malaoxon as the substrate. The trihalogenated benzenes decreased the inhibitory effect of malathion on cholinesterase activity in the brain and to a lesser degree in the red blood cells, but not in 1iver or plasma.",

If released to the atmosphere, p-dibromobenzene will exist soley in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on a measured vapor pressure of 0.058 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase p-dibromobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 30 days. An estimated Koc value of 2,700 suggests that p-dibromobenzene will have slight mobility in soil. Volatilizaton from moist soil surfaces should occur based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.9X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces should not be important given the vapor pressure of this compound. p-Dibromobenzene is not biodegraded in screening studies using an innoculated sludge; 0% degradation was reported after two weeks. In water, p-dibromobenzene is expected to adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its Koc value. This compound will volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 and 157 hrs, respectively. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms should be moderate to very high based on measured BCF values ranging from 42.9 to 1413. Given the commercial uses of p-dibromobenzene, human exposure appears to be only likely from occupational situations by dermal and inhalation routes. (SRC)",

Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 and 157 hrs, respectively(1,SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), experimental BCF values ranging from 42.9 to 1,413(6,7,SRC) suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to very high(SRC). Based on limited screening data, this compound is resistant to biodegradation; 0 biodegradation occurred after a period of two weeks(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This value indicates that p-dibromobenzene will volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 5.9 hours(3,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 157 days(3,SRC). p-Dibromobenzene's values for vapor pressure(1) and Henry's Law constant(1,2,SRC) indicate that volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).",

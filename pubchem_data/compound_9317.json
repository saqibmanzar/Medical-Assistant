Group A was fed with distilled water as control group. Group B, C and D were fed with the water including 0.5% lead acetate continuously for 1, 2 or 3 mo respectively. At the end of treatment, the expressions of renal NF-kappaB, TGF-beta, and FN were detected by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. RESULTS: The immunohistochemistry analysis showed that expressions of NF-kappaB in group B, C and D (0.2315 +/- 0.0624, 0.3213 +/- 0.0740, 0.4729 +/- 0.0839 respectively) were continuously increased as compared with that in group A (0.1464 +/- 0.0624). The RT-PCR analysis showed that expressions of NF-kappaB in group B, C and D (0.4370 +/- 0.0841, 0.5465 +/- 0.0503, 0.6443 +/- 0.0538 respectively) were also increased as compared with that in group A (0.3608 +/- 0.0550). However, there was no change for TGF-beta in 4 groups except that it was increased markedly in group D (0.5225 +/- 0.0416) as compared with that in group A (0.4645 +/- 0.0461) by RT-PCR.

Rat pups were lactationally exposed to 0.2% lead acetate from birth through weaning. Changes in the developmental profiles of 30 TFs were screened in hippocampal tissue on postnatal day (PND) 5, 15, and 30. The temporal patterns of some TFs were transiently upregulated or repressed following lead exposure in a stage-specific manner; however, Oct-2, which is involved in the regulation of key developmental processes, exhibited sustained elevations during the entire period of study. Lead-induced elevation of Oct-2 was validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis; however, significant elevation of Oct-2 mRNA expression was detected only on PND 5. The DNA-binding activity and protein levels of Oct-2 were further evaluated and found to be consistently induced on PND 5. The elevations observed in Oct-2 mRNA and protein levels as well as DNA-binding activity on PND 5 suggest that developmental maintenance of Oct-2 DNA binding could be impacted through de novo synthesis. These findings identify Oct-2 as a potential molecular target for Pb and suggest that Oct-2 may be associated with lead-induced disturbances in gene expression.",

The low lead dosage group and the high lead dosage group were given respectively 0.06%, 0.2%  lead acetate orally while the control group was given distilled water orally. The Y-maze test was used to measure the ability of learning and memory ...  and the in situ hybridization (ISH) method to determine the expression of Hoxa9 mRNA in brain. RESULTS: (1) The number of electric shocks of the lead poisoned rats were significantly increased over time. The number of electric shocks of the lead poisoning rats was much higher than that of the control group (P < 0.01) (at the end of the experiment, the low lead dosage group: 31.8 +/- 2.26; the high lead dosage group: 37.3 +/- 1.70; the control group: 18.4 +/- 1.51). (2) The brain of the lead poisoned rats including the hippocampus, the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex were significantly atrophic and the apoptosis and necrosis occurred in the cells of the brain. Purkinje's cells in the cerebellum showed significant necrosis and disappearance. The structure of brain in rats of the control group demonstrated no atrophy. (3) The expression of Hoxa9 mRNA in the lead poisoned rats was significantly decreased compared with the control group. There were few Hoxa9 positive cells in the brain of the lead poisoned rats, but many of them were observed in the control group./It was concluded that/ lead may inhibit the expression of Hoxa9 and induce atrophy and necrosis of brain, which gives rise to a damage of learning and memory.",

People can also be exposed to lead acetate by eating contaminated foods. Like other forms of lead, lead acetate can cause lead poisoning. Exposure to lead can cause hypertension and damage the kidneys, blood, and nervous system. Children are especially sensitive to lead. It harms the brain and causes problems with learning and behavior. When a pregnant woman is exposed to lead, it can harm the fetus. Because of this potential, the European Commission Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products Intended for Consumers recommends that cosmetics should not include lead acetate.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Mercury levels of 6.0 and 5.6 ppm were obtained from the 1815 and 1839 hair specimens, respectively. Lead levels were significantly elevated in both the 1815 sample (mean lead level, 130.5 ppm) and the 1839 sample (mean lead level, 44 ppm). These results suggest that Jackson had mercury and lead exposure, the latter compatible with symptomatic plumbism in the 1815 sample.

Lead also affects the nervous system by impairing regulation of dopamine synthesis and blocking evoked release of acetylcholine.

Lead was administered orally as lead acetate (50 mg/kg bw) daily for 3 mo to male Portan rats with or without zinc (1 mg/kg bw as zinc sulphate) ... There was a 30% reduction in lead deposition in the testis when zinc was coadministered. At the subcellular level, there was differential accumulation of lead; the nucleus preferentially took up the metal after lead treatment alone, while zinc coadministration shifted lead accumulation to the mitochondria. A significant decrease in delta-ALAD and in SOD activity was seen in the testis with lead treatment. Coadministration of zinc prevented these decreases, at least partially. Zinc coadministration did not prevent the inhibition of catalase observed with lead treatment. Histologically, the alterations in the testis with lead treatment alone were more pronounced compared to animals in which zinc was supplemented. Improvement in the inhibition of delta-ALAD and in the ubiquitous cellular enzyme SOD suggests less testicular tissue damage due to detoxification of free radicals. In conclusion, zinc supplementation ameliorates lead-induced testicular damage both at the cellular and subcellular level ...",

The test substances were administered by gavage on Days 6-15 of gestation. In Trial 1, five groups were treated with lead acetate administered at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 10.0, and 1000.0 mg/kg bw, respectively. In Trial 2, lead acetate was applied at doses of 0.1, 10.0 and 1000.0 mg/kg bw, respectively. In the latter case the dose of the pesticide was 750 mg/kg bw in all treated groups. Lead acetate was not teratogenic after a single administration. Combined administration of lead acetate and mancozeb gave rise to the following toxic effects: average maternal wt decreased during pregnancy, the ratio of live fetuses decreased after the two lowest doses, and fetal mortality increased in the lowest and in the highest dose groups. The ratio of fetal resorption was higher in all the treated groups than in the control group. A significant decrease occurred in average fetal and placental wt in each treated group as compared to the control. Maternal toxicity was expressed in paralysis of the hindlimbs in the two lowest dose groups. Maternal mortality was between 16.7 and 23.3% at the three dose levels. Phocomelia and hernia cerebri occurred as characteristic fetal developmental anomalies in all the treated groups. It is concluded that the joint administration of lead acetate and a mancozeb-containing fungicide can cause maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity and characteristic teratogenic effects.",

Six-day-old Wistar rats of both genders were divided into two groups-untreated (Pb) and treated (Pb + succimer (meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA)-with 10  animals per group. Lead (as acetate) was given orally at a dose of 2 mg/kg bw per day for eight consecutive days (total dose 16 mg/kg, i.e. 0.08 mmol/kg). During this period the treated group received a daily dose of 0.5 mmol DMSA/kg bw po six times on days 1-3 and 6-8 of the experiment (total dose 3 mmol/kg) ... The DMSA efficiently reduced the lead concn in the analysed tissues (carcass, liver, kidneys, and brain) by approximately 50% compared with untreated controls. The pups' growth and organ weights were not affected. In conclusion, ... DMSA is an efficient oral lead chelator in sucklings even if challenged with ongoing lead exposure.",

The control group consisted of 21 nonexposed rats. Seven rats from each group were killed on days 60 and 90. At the end of the 90-day period, 21 of the lead-exposed rats were treated with disodium monocalcium EDTA (50 mg/kg/d x 5 days) ip, and 21 were administered serum saline by the same route. Three treatment courses were given separated by 9 days free of treatment. Seven rats from each subgroup were sacrificed at the end of each treatment course. Main findings related to poisoning were hypertrophy and vacuolization of medium and small arteries; mucoid edema and muscular hypertrophy in arterioles; loss of cell brush borders, cell loss, and intranuclear inclusion bodies in the proximal tubule; and fibrosis and the presence of infiltrates in the interstitial component. Treatment with EDTA slowed the progression of most alterations. No damage associated with the use of the chelating agent was observed ...",

Increases in blood lead levels were accompanied by decreases in the activity of delta-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) in the blood to levels of 45-70% of the initial values by the end of exposure. Free erythrocyte porphyrins (FEP) were increased after a latent period of 0-21 days from the beginning of lead exposure. The rate of increase of FEP and the latent period were influenced by the percentage absorption of the lead from the gastrointestinal tract, the distribution of absorbed lead within the body and the rate of release of new erythrocytes from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood.",

The former effect could follow from the induction of DNA strand breaks and/or alkali-labile sites (ALS), the latter from the formation of DNA-DNA and/or DNA-protein cross-links. No difference was observed between tail length for the alkaline and pH 12.1 versions of the assay, which indicates that strand breaks and not ALS are responsible for the tail length increase induced by lead. The neutral version of the test revealed that lead acetate induced DNA double-strand breaks at all concn tested. The presence of spin traps, 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), and N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) did not influence the level of DNA damage induced by lead ...",

Brn-3a is a member of the Pit-Oct-Unc (POU) family of transcription factors that is expressed predominantly in neuronal cells. It exists in two forms, with the long form containing 84 amino acids at the N-terminus that are lacking in the short form. The N-terminal domain unique to the long form induces expression of the Bcl-2 gene and protects neuronal cells against apoptosis whereas the C-terminal POU domain common to both forms is sufficient for activating a number of other neuronally expressed genes and stimulating neuronal process outgrowth ... Brn-3a protein and RNA expression in rat brain /were examined/ following low-level lead exposure during development and subsequent effects on spatial learning and memory. Two groups of rats were investigated: a control group and a lead-exposed group (0.2% lead acetate in the drinking water of the dam from gestational day 15 to postnatal day 21). Levels of Brn-3a were measured in rat cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, both protein and mRNA levels were reduced in lead-exposed group (p < 0.05). In Morris water maze, we found spatial learning deficits in rats of lead-exposed group (p < 0.05). These data suggest that the alteration of Brn-3a may play a key role in the mechanisms underlying lead neurotoxicity.",

At different time intervals following this acute treatment, several biochemical, physiological, and behavioral responses were recorded. Results indicated that acute lead acetate has deleterious dose-dependent effects on brain and bw. The effect on bw in the present study was transient, although lead acetate was detected in neural tissues for several days after administration. Spontaneous locomotor activity only was reduced up until 24 hr. The effect of lead on bw was strain-dependent, with Swiss mice showing greater resistance compared to the other strains ...",

Minimal kidney damage shown by increased urinary gamma-glutamyl transferase activity was observed only in males given the highest dose. In all animals and at all doses, natriuria /(excess sodium in urine)/ was significantly decreased on the first day (from 4 h after administration). Such changes evoke mild tubular abnormalities but glomerular disturbances may also be involved.",

A previous study at the other RACB laboratory found significant toxicity at concns in the drinking water = or >0.5%. Thus, levels for this study were set at 0.125, 0.25, & 0.5% w/v in drinking water. The highest level of PbA caused a slight (nearly =10%) reduction in water consumption, though body weight was unaffected during Task 2. Based on measures of water consumption & body weights, these concns of PbA produced consumption estimates of nearly =200, 375, & 700 mg PbA/kg/day. In the first generation (Task 2), 1 control female, 1 low dose female, 4 middle dose females, & 7 females & 1 male at the high dose died during Task 2. These deaths were considered treatment-related, but the cause of death was not determined. F0 body weights were not affected by PbA consumption. There was a 7% decr in adjusted live pup weight at the high dose, though PbA did not alter the number of litters/pair or the number of pups/litter. Task 3 (the crossover study) was not conducted since there were no changes in pup number, & only small changes in pup weight which were expected to be difficult to replicate in the single-mating trial of Task 3. Thus, Task 4 was conducted with offspring from the control & 0.5% groups. Body weights to weaning were not collected during nursing of the second generation, though mortality in these mice was increased at 4 wks of age by 15% & 30% for males & females, respectively. At F1 mating, mating & fertility indices were equal between the two groups. F2 pup body weight was reduced by nearly equal to 16%, though litter size & pup viability were unaffected. After the F2 litters were evaluated, the F1 adults were killed & necropsied. Females consuming 0.5% PbA weighed nearly =12% less than controls, & brain weight was nearly =7% less than controls, while adjusted spleen weight was 2.2 times greater than controls. Ante-mortem estrous cycle evaluations were not performed. For treated males, body weight was reduced by nearly =11%, while absolute testis weight was nearly =9% less than controls. Absolute brain & relative kidney weights were reduced by nearly =5% & 13%, respectively, while relative spleen weight was increased 1.7-fold. Sperm measures were unaffected by PbA consumption. Thus, this study replicated the Task 2 mortality & pup body weight effects seen in the first study, while showing that lead acetate trihydrate caused reproductive toxicity only in the presence of adult mortality or systemic changes (spleen weight, brain weight changes).",

From data in the literature, levels of 0.5, 1.0, & 2.0% in water were selected for the continuous breeding phase of the study. For the first generation (Task 2), mortalities were elevated at all doses. In controls animals, 3 males & 4 females (3M/4F) died, while in low, medium, & high doses, 0M/12F, 1M/16F, & 16M17F died, respectively. This excessive mortality confounds the interpretation of the other data. In the low & middle dose groups, the death occurred late in Task 2, while the high dose deaths occurred throughout Task 2. The following number of pairs could still contribute data for Task 2: 36, 19, 10, & 4, from the control to high dose groups, respectively. Reproductive toxicity was observable at all dose levels. The number of litters/pair was reduced by 29% & 58% in the middle & high dose groups. The number of live pups/litter was also reduced in medium & high doses (16% & 55% respectively), while adjusted live pup weight was reduced in all groups by 4% (low), 12% (medium), & 16% (high). At the high dose, cumulative days to litter increased markedly for all litters. No high-dose pair produced a fifth litter. Despite the excessive mortality, a Task 3 crossover study was performed to attempt to identify the more affected sex, using the control & 0.5% PbA mice. Pairs with a treated female delivered nearly =16% fewer pups/litter. Females in this group continued to die (3 of 9 died during this task). After the Task 3 litters were delivered & evaluated the F0 adult control & 0.5% PbA animals were killed & necropsied. Female body weight was unaffected, but brain weight was reduced by nearly =8%. The estrous cycle was unaffected in the 6 remaining femnales. Male body weight was unaffected by 0.5% PbA; organ weights did not differ between the groups, nor did sperm measures. Task 4, the F2 generation assessment, only used offspring from the low dose group. Body weights & viability were not recorded during nursing. At the beginning of the cohabitation period for Task 4, body weights for treated mice were lower than controls by 12% (males) & 6% (females). There were sufficient mice to compose 14 control pairs & 16 treated pairs. The PbA-treated mice delivered 20% fewer live pups/litter, & those pups weighed nearly =7% less than their controls. Pup viability & sex ratio were unaffected by PbA exposure. After the F2 pups were evaluated & removed, the F1 adults were killed & necropsied. Treated females weighed nearly =6% less than controls, while the pituitary weighed 35% less. Interestingly, the estrous cycle did not differ between the groups. For males, body weight was reduced by 12%, & absolute testis weight was 11% less than controls. Sperm measures did not differ between these two groups. In conclusion, these concns of lead acetate trihydrate produced mortality & reproductive toxicity.",

Treatment-related increases in the kidney weights were observed in both sexes but the effect was more prominent in the females. Microscopic evaluation of the left kidneys revealed treatment-related lead inclusions seen in the nuclei of tubular epithelial cells & tubular epithelial cell megalocytosis. The incidence of these lesions increased with the duration of exposure: more than half the females in the 0.1% group showed lead inclusions at 16 & 24 wks, while almost all the males & females in the 0.3% group were affected at 16 & 24 wks. No treatment-related differences were observed in sperm motion parameters or in testicular spermatid head counts at any of the time points evaluated. After one wk of treatment, the mean % abnormal sperm values were increased by 83% & 72% in the 0.1 & 0.3% males, respectively, when compared to controls but were comparable among dose groups after 4, 8, 16, & 24 wks of treatment. After 1 wk of treatment, mean epididymal sperm density was decreased by 25% in the 0.3% group when compared to controls. Mean epididymal sperm density values were comparable among the dose groups after 4, 8, & 16 weeks of treatment, with an exception of an increased (23%) epididymal sperm density count in 0.05% males at Week 16. After 24 wks of treatment, the mean epididymal sperm density values were decreased by 23 & 18% in the 0.1 & 0.3% males, respectively, when compared to controls. The testes were not evaluated microscopically. Based on the data presented in this report (body weight, food & water consumption, clinical & gross observation, organ weight, & sperm analysis data), lead acetate trihydrate is not a selective male reproductive toxicant, because the minor effects on sperm density occurred concomitant with, or at doses greater than, those doses that produced microscopic changes in the left kidneys. The only female reproductive data presented in this report are the uterine & ovarian weights which were comparable among control & treated groups. The no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was not established in this study as the 0.025% animals displayed decreases in water consumption. A max tolerated dose (MTD) was reached for the 0.3% dose group, based on decreased water consumption, increased kidney weights, & increased incidence of renal intranuclear lead inclusions & renal tubular megalocytosis. The remainder of parameters (immuno-histochemistry, Northern analysis of DNA, Western analysis of proteins, blood analyses, sperm chromatin structure, nerve structure & myelin mRNA levels, skeletal lead levels, & osteocalcin levels), analyzed by the collaborators, will be reported separately. /Lead Acetate Trihydrate/",

The toxicity of lead-contaminated sediment from the Coeur d'Alene River Basin (CDARB) in Idaho was examined on posthatching development of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings for 6 wk. Day-old ducklings received either untreated control diet, clean sediment (24%) supplemented control diet, CDARB sediment (3,449 ug/g lead) supplemented diets at 12% or 24%, or a positive control diet containing lead acetate equivalent to that found in 24% CDARB. The 12% CDARB diet resulted in a geometric mean blood lead concn of 1.41 ppm (WW) with over 90% depression of red blood cell Aminolevulinic Acid Dehydratase (ALAD) activity and over threefold elevation of free erythrocyte protoporphyrin concn. The 24% CDARB diet resulted in blood lead of 2.56 ppm with over sixfold elevation of protoporphyrin and lower brain wt. In this group the liver lead concn was 7.92 ppm (WW), and there was a 40% increase in hepatic reduced glutathione concn. The kidney lead concn in this group was 7.97 ppm, and acid-fast inclusion bodies were present in the kidneys of four of nine ducklings. The lead acetate positive control group was more adversely affected in most respects than the 24% CDARB group. With a less optimal diet (mixture of two thirds corn and one third standard diet), CDARB sediment was more toxic; blood lead levels were higher, body growth and liver biochemistry (TBARS) were more affected, and prevalence of acid-fast inclusion bodies increased. Lead from CDARB sediment accumulated more readily in duckling blood and liver than reported in goslings, but at given concn was generally less toxic to ducklings. Many of these effects are similar to ones reported in wild mallards and geese within the CDARB.",

A 15 yr research program on the behavioral effects of lead using herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and common terns (Sterna hirundo), referred to as larids, as models is reviewed. The doses used in laboratory studies were sufficient to produce lead concn in feathers that were equivalent to those found in some birds living in the wild. The exposure consisted of a single or multiple ip injection(s) of lead acetate. Both dose and day of exposure influenced behavioral development in young larids, with most effects increasing with dose, and decreasing with age. Low-level lead affected growth, locomotion, balance, food begging, feeding, thermoregulation, depth perception, and individual recognition in laboratory and in wild birds. The accuracy of individual recognition was most affected by lead exposure from 2 to 6 days of age; exposure at 12 days did not affect accuracy, but it delayed response time significantly. Behavioral deficits observed in lead-injected young in the wild were similar to those observed in the laboratory, except that recovery was more complete by fledging than it was in laboratory-raised chicks. Further, parents in the wild were able to provision lead-exposed chicks sufficiently so that they fledged at similar weights as control chicks, a feat that is difficult to achieve in the laboratory. The lead-induced behavioral deficits observed in the laboratory and in the wild are sufficient to affect growth and survival in wild herring gulls. Lead treatment altered the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which play a crucial role in the formation and deployment of neurons in the developing brain. The timing and sequencing of CAM expression is critical to normal development, and the different consequences of lead exposure at different ages may be related to interference at different points in the sequence.",

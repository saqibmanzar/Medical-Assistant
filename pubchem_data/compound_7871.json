When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

In the blood, sarin first interacts with several esterases... Some of the esterases, such as paraoxonase, hydrolyze sarin to inactive metabolites. Two other blood esterases - AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) - irreversibly bind to sarin. AChE found on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs), although chemically indistinguishable from AChE in the nervous system, has unknown physiological functions. These esterases in the blood are often described as \"false targets\" - by binding irreversibly to sarin, AChE and BuChE sequester sarin in the blood, thereby preventing some or all from reaching the CNS. However, esterases in the blood can be overwhelmed by high doses of sarin. The acute cholinergic syndrome occurs when RBC AChE is inhibited by 75 to 80 percent",

Most of the patients examined had marked miosis and decreased serum cholinesterase activity. Transient increase of serum CPK activity after 3 days of the exposure was the another sign. /The authors/  intensively analyzed the metabolites in the urine of 4 patients. The following analytic results indicated the exposure to sarin as well as contaminated compounds such as diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP), ethyl methylphosphonate fluoridate (EMPF, or ethylsarin), diethyl methylphosphonate (DEMP), and ethyl isopropyl methylphosphonate (EIMP). (1) Isopropanol (IPA) and ethanol (EtOH) were detected of large quantities in the urine samples, and were thought to be derived from sarin and the sarin counterpart, ethyl methylphosphonate fluoridate, diisopropyl methylphosphonate, diethyl methylphosphonate and ethyl isopropyl methylphosphonate. (2) Monoalkyl methylphosphonic acids (isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA) and ethyl methylphosphonic acid (EMPA) also were excreted in large amounts with taking the similar excretion pattern of isopropanol and EtOH. (3) The metabolite only derived from sarin and ethylsarin is F anions whose integral output in the urine was less than the equimolar level of the excreted (isopropyl methylphosphonic acid + ethyl methylphosphonic acid + isopropanol + ethanol). (4) Other corroborative findings were low lethality: of more than 5,510 patients treated, 11 were acutely dead. (5) Nine exposed males had higher sister chromatid exchange (SCE) rate (5.00 + or - 1.48/cell) than the control (3.81 + or - 0.697/cell), because dialkyl methylphosphonates seemed to have alkylating activity and producing DNA adducts. The sister chromatid exchange rate also increased after the in vitro exposure of lymphocytes to dialkyl methylphosphonates.",

The sarin metabolite isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA) was found in urine of humans after the terrorist attack on the Tokyo subway system... .  /There were/  peak levels of IMPA or methylphosphonic acid in urine 10 to 18 hours after exposure ... . The levels of IMPA in urine correlated with the degree of clinical symptoms. /There was/ also ... evidence of distribution of sarin to the human brain in 4 of the 12 people who died after exposure. Solubilized sarin-bound AChE from formalin-fixed cerebellar tissue of victims of the Tokyo attack contained a derivative of the sarin hydrolysis product methylphosphonic acid (MPA). The estimated amounts of MPA ranged from 0.32 to 1.13 nmol/g tissue. Although no IMPA was found, it was assumed that IMPA had hydrolyzed to MPA in the formalin solution over 2 years of storage.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

AChE is responsible for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh) at the synapse, and inhibition of AChE leads to a rise in ACh and overstimulation at cholinergic synapses. At those synapses, the ACh binds and activates muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, the two major subtypes of ACh receptors. Sarin inhibits AChE by phosphorylating a serine hydroxyl on the ester portion of the active site of the enzyme. The phosphorylated enzyme is hydrolyzed very slowly, with a half-life of reactivation of hours to days. The phosphorylated enzyme can undergo a second process, called aging, by loss of an alkyl group (dealkylation). Aging occurs within about 5 hr of sarin exposure. After aging has occurred, the phosphorylated enzyme is resistant to cleavage or hydrolysis and can be considered irreversibly inhibited. Recovery of AChE function occurs only with synthesis of new enzyme. Most of the effects of sarin, including the acute cholinergic syndrome, are thought to be mediated by the excess ACh at the synapse.",

The functional consequences of such binding were investigated here using ...  VX, echothiophate, sarin, and soman. VX (charged at physiological pH) and echothiophate (formally charged) inhibited a specific signal transduction pathway in CHO cells expressing either the M(1) or M(3) mAChR. Hence, they blocked carbamylcholine (CCh)-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) synthesis (muM) and had almost no effect on CCh-induced phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis. These substances were inactive on forskolin-induced cAMP inhibition signaling in CHO cells expressing M(2) mAChR. In binding studies, using [(3)H]-N-methyl scopolamine ([(3)H]NMS) as the competitor ligand, the ChEIs, VX and echothiophate exhibited binding to rat cortical mAChR with K(i) values in the muM range. The non-charged compounds, sarin and soman, were inert in modulating both cAMP metabolism and PI hydrolysis in CHO cells expressing M(1), M(2), and M(3) mAChRs, and no binding was observed in presence of [(3)H]NMS. ...",

To help determine these pathways, /investigators/ previously used microarray analysis to identify gene expression changes in the rat piriform cortex, a region of the rat brain sensitive to nerve agent exposure, over a 24-hr time period following sarin-induced seizure. /The authors/ found significant differences in gene expression profiles and identified secondary responses that potentially lead to brain injury and cell death. To advance /the/  understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in sarin-induced toxicity, /the authors/ analyzed gene expression changes in four other areas of the rat brain known to be affected by nerve agent-induced seizure (amygdala, hippocampus, septum, and thalamus). /Investigators/ compared the transcriptional response of these four brain regions to sarin-induced seizure with the response previously characterized in the piriform cortex. In this study, rats were challenged with 1.0 x LD50 sarin and subsequently treated with atropine sulfate, 2-pyridine aldoxime methylchloride, and diazepam. The four brain regions were collected at 0.25, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hr after seizure onset, and total RNA was processed for microarray analysis. Principal component analysis identified brain region and time following seizure onset as major sources of variability within the dataset. Analysis of variance identified genes significantly changed following sarin-induced seizure, and gene ontology analysis identified biological pathways, functions, and networks of genes significantly affected by sarin-induced seizure over the 24-hr time course. Many of the molecular functions and pathways identified as being most significant across all of the brain regions were indicative of an inflammatory response. There were also a number of molecular responses that were unique for each brain region, with the thalamus having the most distinct response to nerve agent-induced seizure. Identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in sarin-induced neurotoxicity in these sensitive brain regions will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics that can potentially provide broad-spectrum protection in five areas of the central nervous system known to be damaged by nerve agent-induced seizure.",

Nerve agents are part of a class known as organophosphorus compounds, and were first synthesized in 1854, but their development as warfare agents did not occur until 80 years later. The first military nerve agent, ethyl phosphorodimethylamidocyanidate, known as tabun, or chemical agent symbol GA, was synthesized in 1936 by Schrader while searching for more effective agricultural organophosphorate insecticides at the German chemical firm of IG Farbenindustrie. Two years later, he synthesized a second nerve agent, isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate, now known as Sarin or GB. In 1944, a third nerve agent, pinacolyl methylphosphonofuoridate, now known as Soman or GD, was synthesized.",

A tandem thermal desorber (TTD) continuously collects and pre-concentrates air. The pre-concentrated samples are then separated in a fast gas chromatographic (GC) run of 6.9 min. and detected by a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS). The GC-TOFMS signals are evaluated using chemometric methods for deconvolution and target identification. The high toxicity of nerve agents requires extremely low detection limits; for some as low as 100 ng/cu m (10 ppt). The combination of TTD, TOFMS and chemometric data evaluation methods enables the system to fulfill this requirement. Calibration measurements for five different CWA simulants show lower limits of detection in the range of 10 ng/cu m-60 ng/cu m (1-11 ppt). In addition, the ability to detect trace concentrations of real CWA is demonstrated with a measurement of 30 pg Sarin on column. Several other real CWA measurements are shown, like sulfur mustard in diesel, lewisite under humid conditions and VX. As part of this work the influence of stationary film thickness on peak tailing of organophosphates is investigated for peak shape optimization.",

An emerging technique, desorption electrospray ionization (DESI-MS/MS), was also investigated for the direct determination of TEP, GB and GD sampled onto solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers exposed to spiked office media.

These adducts may offer relatively long-lived biological markers of nerve agent exposure that do not 'age' rapidly, and which are not degraded by therapy with oximes. Sensitive methods for the detection of these adducts have been developed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Adducts of all four nerve agents were detected in the blood of exposed guinea pigs being used in studies to improve medical countermeasures. The tyrosine adducts with soman and tabun were detected in guinea pigs receiving therapy 7 days following subcutaneous administration of five times the LD(50) dose of the respective nerve agent. VX also forms a tyrosine adduct in human blood in vitro but only at high concentrations.",

OPC adducts of butyrylcholinesterase and albumin are considered to be valuable biomarkers for retrospective verification of OPC exposure. Therefore, we have detected and identified novel adducts of human serum albumin (HSA) by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Pure albumin and plasma were incubated with numerous pesticides and NA of the V- and G-type in different molar ratios. Samples were prepared either by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by in-gel enzymatic cleavage using endoproteinase Glu-C (Glu-C) or by combining highly albumin-selective affinity extraction with ultrafiltration followed by reduction, carbamidomethylation, and enzymatic cleavage (Glu-C) prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Characteristic mass shifts for phosphylation revealed tyrosine adducts at Y(411) (Y(401)KFQNALLVRY(411)TKKVPQVSTPTLVE(425)), Y(148) and Y(150) (I(142)ARRHPY(148)FY(150)APE(153), single and double labeled), and Y(161) (L(154)LFFAKRY(161)KAAFTE(167)) produced by original NA (tabun, sarin, soman, cyclosarin, VX, Chinese VX, and Russian VX) as well as by chlorpyrifos-oxon, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), paraoxon-ethyl (POE), and profenofos. MALDI-MS/MS of the single-labeled (142)I-E(153) peptide demonstrated that Y(150) was phosphylated with preference to Y(148). Aged albumin adducts were not detected. The procedure described was reproducible and feasible for detection of adducts at the most reactive Y(411)-residue (S/N > or =3) when at least 1% of total albumin was labeled. This was achieved by incubating plasma with molar HSA/OPC ratios ranging from approximately 1:0.03 (all G-type NA, DFP, and POE) to 1:3 (V-type NA, profenofos). Relative signal intensity of the Y(411) adduct correlated well with the spotted relative molar amount underlining the usefulness for quantitative adduct determination. In conclusion, the current analytical design exhibits potential as a verification tool for high-dose exposure.",

In a comparative study, RBC-AChE and serum BChE activities in whole blood was obtained from forty seven healthy male and female human volunteers, and then exposed separately ex vivo to three OP nerve agents (soman (GD), sarin (GB) and VX) to generate a wide range of inhibition of AChE and BChE activity (up to 90% of control). These samples were measured using four different ChE assays: (i) colorimetric microEllman (using DTNB at 412 nm), (ii) Test-mate ChE field kit (also based on the Ellman assay), (iii) Michel (delta pH), and (iv) the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Whole Blood (WRAIR WB) cholinesterase assay. The WRAIR assay is a modified Ellman method using DTP at 324 nm (which minimizes hemoglobin interference and improves sensitivity), and determines AChE and BChE in a small whole blood sample simultaneously. Scatter plots of RBC-AChE activities were determined using the WRAIR ChE assay versus the micro-Ellman, Test-mate and Michel after exposure to varying concentrations of soman, sarin and VX. Regression analyses yielded mostly linear relationships with high correlations (r2 = 0.83-0.93) for RBC-AChE values in the WRAIR assay compared to the alternate methods. For the plasma BChE measurements, individual human values were significantly more variable (as expected), resulting in lower correlations using WRAIR ChE versus the alternate assays (r2 values 0.5 - 0.6). To circumvent the limitations of simple correlation analysis, Bland and Altman analysis for comparing two independent measurement techniques was performed. For example, a Bland and Altman plot of the ratio of the WRAIR whole blood AChE and Michel AChE (plotted on the y-axis) vs. the average of the two methods (x-axis) shows that the majority of the individual AChE values are within +/- 1.96 S.D. of the mean difference, indicating that the two methods may be used interchangeably with a high degree of confidence. The WRAIR ChE assay can thus be used as a reliable inter-conversion assay when comparing results from laboratory-based (Michel) and field-based (Test-mate ChE kit), which use different methodology and report in different units of AChE activity.",

Human albumin or plasma was treated with organophosphorus (OP) agent at alkaline pH, digested with pepsin at pH 2.3, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Two singly charged peaks m/z 1718 and 1831, corresponding to the unlabeled peptide fragments containing the active site Tyr411 residue, were detected in all samples. The sequences of the two peptides were VRYTKKVPQVSTPTL and LVRYTKKVPQVSTPTL. The peptide-OP adducts of these peptides were also found. They had masses of 1854 and 1967 for chlorpyrifos oxon, 1825 and 1938 for dichlorvos, 1881 and 1994 for DFP, and 1838 and 1938 for sarin; these masses fit a mechanism whereby OP bound covalently to Tyr411. The binding of DFP to Tyr411 of human albumin was confirmed by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry and analysis of product ions. None of the OP-albumin adducts lost an alkoxy group, leading to the conclusion that aging did not occur. /The/ results show that OP pesticides and nerve agents bind covalently to human albumin at Tyr411. The presence of Tyr411 on an exposed surface of albumin suggests that an antibody response could be generated against OP-albumin adducts.",

All clothing should be removed and placed in sealed polythene bags. Jewelry, watches, money and other personal possessions should be collected and placed in labeled polythene bags. Two approaches to decontamination are feasible: the \"bucket and sponge\" method taking one patient at a time, or the mass decontamination approach with attendants supervising the passage of a queue of people through some communal shower unit. Patients who have been injured or are unable to help themselves should be decontaminated by trained attendants using a system in which a stretcher is placed on a table equipped with rollers that allows transfer of the decontaminated patient to a clean stretcher, and ambulance and to hospital. Some authorities have argued for the addition of liquid soap to the water used in automated decontamination units. This will speed the process of material but the interaction of water and soap leading to foaming when passed through a jet should be considered. Whatever means of decontamination are used it should be thorough. This means that each patient will need some minutes of attention: up to 15 or so minutes may be needed to deal with an incapacitated patient. Whatever system is used, plans for dealing with waste water and any decontaminants used should be devised and practiced in advance of an incident occurring. Waste water may be collected inside an area protected by inflatable \"bunds\". ...If waste water is to be allowed to run into drains, the local water company should be informed. ...Suitable towels and clothing must be provided, modesty should be preserved and consideration given to how people are to make their way home. /Chemical warfare agents/",

In the late evening of June 27, 1994, Japanese terrorists spread sarin vapor, using a heater and fan mounted on a truck, in a residential neighborhood near the center of Matsumoto, Japan. About 600 people (residents and rescue teams) developed acute symptoms of sarin exposure (i.e., the acute cholinergic syndrome); 58 were admitted to hospitals, 253 sought medical assistance, and 7 people died. Sarin was later detected in air and water samples by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Several case reports, case series, and a population-based epidemiologic study emerged from this attack on a civilian population. The population-based study, the first of its kind on sarin exposure, identified symptoms persisting up to years after exposure. ... A case series at one of the nearby hospitals reported that 17 of 18 patients admitted soon after the attack had an average reduction of plasma cholinesterase activity of 94%. In a larger case series, medical records were collected for 264 people who sought treatment, and health examinations were performed on 155 residents 3 weeks postexposure. This case series found that severely symptomatic patients examined at 3 weeks continued to exhibit decreased activity of plasma cholinesterase and RBC AChE; reduced serum triglyceride, serum potassium, and chloride; and elevated serum creatinine kinase, leukocytes, and ketones in urine. Blood cholinesterase levels returned to normal within 3 months. Most patients recovered by 6 months. Yet two of the nine severely poisoned patients displayed epileptiform abnormalities ... In a ...  follow-up examination ... four of six severely poisoned patients were reported to display visual field defects, hypoxia, low-grade fever, and what were described as \"epileptic electroencephalographic changes\" up to 2 years postexposure. At 7 months postexposure, one patient also developed sensory polyneuropathy and reduced sensory nerve conduction velocity. ... With the exception of this poorly documented case of delayed sensory neuropathy, there ... /appeared/ to be no other cases of delayed neurotoxicity resembling organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy ... .  The Matsumoto incident also triggered the first population-based study of the long-term effects of a single exposure to sarin. ... All residents (n = 2,052) living within a defined geographic area surrounding the sarin release site (1,050 meters from north to south; 850 meters from east to west) /were/ mailed questionnaires at various times until 3 years after the incident. At the outset of the study (3 weeks postexposure), about 27% of the cohort (n = 471) was classified as \"victims\" based on their reports of either receiving a diagnosis or reporting symptoms of acute cholinergic syndrome. They were compared with so-called \"nonvictim\" controls (n = 669) who lived in the same geographic area as the victims but did not report having acute cholinergic symptoms or diagnosis.  At 1 year, 54 of 318 victims (17%) still reported being symptomatic. More than 80% of victims lived closest to the site of sarin release. There were no age or gender differences between those whose acute symptoms either persisted or resolved. The most common symptoms were asthenopia (38/54), fatigue (35/54), blurred vision (30/54), shoulder stiffness (19/54), and asthenia (18/54). At 3 years, 27.5% of 167 victims reported being symptomatic, compared with 5.4% of controls. The odds ratios were highest for fatigue, headache, and visual disturbances (asthenopia, blurred vision, and narrowing of visual field). The limitations of the study were low response rate at 3 years (41.8%) and possible recall bias. It must also be pointed out that the controls were not necessarily unexposed; they likely were a mixed population of unexposed and low-level exposed individuals. The Matsumoto experience shows that direct exposure to sarin, particularly at intermediate to high levels, is associated with the acute cholinergic syndrome.",

On the morning of March 20, 1995, terrorists simultaneously released diluted sarin vapor into three convergent lines of the Tokyo subway system. About 5,000 people sought medical evaluation, 1,000 of whom were symptomatic and 12 of whom died. The hospital in closest proximity to the attacks, St. Luke's International Hospital, treated the largest group of patients (n = 641). Medical staff assessed most of these patients (83%) as having an intermediate level of exposure based on miosis (the most common symptom), blurred vision, and headache. Seventeen percent of the patients were presumed to have had high-level exposure. This patient group, which was admitted to the hospital, had more severe cholinergic signs and symptoms including marked miosis, weakness, difficulty breathing, fasciculations, convulsions, and >20 percent depression of cholinesterase activity in the blood. Most of these patients were given standard treatment for acute sarin intoxication (atropine, pralidoxime chloride, and diazepam). Five patients were critically ill with cardiac arrest ... . Questionnaires were distributed at 1, 3, and 6 months after the incident to 610 patients seen at St. Luke's International Hospital. Almost 60 percent of 475 respondents (290 patients) still reported symptoms related to the exposure, such as fear of subways, sleep disturbance, flashbacks, nightmares, and mood changes - symptoms ... indicative of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Six to eight months later, 18 symptom-free survivors with previous intermediate- and high-level exposure to sarin were tested for persistent CNS effects. At the time of their past admission to the hospital, their plasma cholinesterase had been depressed by about 25 percent of normal. ...  The event-related potential (ERP) (P300) and the visual-evoked potential (VEP) (P100) displayed slight yet significant prolongation in sarin-exposed subjects, compared with 18 sex- and age-matched control subjects (healthy volunteers). There was no relationship in the sarin-exposed group between neurophysiological findings and scores for PTSD, which were significantly elevated compared to controls. Short-latency brain stem auditory evoked potentials and electrocardiography were not different between cases and controls. Findings were interpreted by the authors as suggestive of long-term neurotoxic effects of high-level exposure to sarin in those individuals who no longer reported symptoms. The same sarin-exposed individuals underwent neurobehavioral testing and vestibulocerebellar testing. For neurobehavioral testing, cases and controls filled out a PTSD checklist and underwent nine tests: digit symbol (psychomotor performance); picture completion (visual perception); digit span (attention and memory); finger tapping (psychomotor performance); reaction time (psychomotor performance); continuous performance test (sustained visual attention); paired-associate learning (learning and memory); General Health Questionnaire (psychiatric symptoms); and the Profile of Mood States. The score on the digit symbol test for sarin-exposed cases was significantly lower than for controls. The scores on the General Health Questionnaire, fatigue (Profile of Mood States), and PTSD checklist were significantly higher for the sarin group. Their scores on the digit symbol test remained significantly decreased even after controlling for the effect of PTSD. ... For vestibulocerebellar testing, /investigators/ used computerized posturography on sarin cases and controls. ... The study found significant impairment only in female cases (n = 9) ... . The authors viewed their findings as suggestive of a gender difference in a \"delayed\" effect of acute sarin poisoning on the vestibulocerebellar system. Their characterization of this effect as \"delayed\" is questionable, since there is no evidence of this postural testing having been performed at an earlier point after sarin exposure. Thus, the effect may be chronic, rather than delayed. The Tokyo sarin experience confirms that acute exposure to sarin leads to the acute cholinergic syndrome.",

Two sites in the complex contained rockets loaded with sarin and cyclosarin. The total amount released, according to the most recent estimates, is 371 kg of sarin and cyclosarin combined. US troops performing demolitions were unaware of the presence of nerve agents, and no air monitoring was conducted at the time of the demolition. Modeling has been conducted to determine potential exposures of US troops. According to model estimates, no troops were exposed to doses greater than would cause \"first noticeable effects\", which would set off chemical alarms and cause visible signs of the acute cholinergic syndrome. There were no medical reports by the US Army Medical Corps at the time of the release that were consistent with signs and symptoms of acute exposure to sarin. That information is consistent with the absence of reports of symptoms of an acute cholinergic syndrome by medical personnel or veterans. ... Two other storage sites in central Iraq, Muhammadiyat and Al Muthanna, sustained damage from air attacks during the Gulf War. Munitions containing 2.9 metric tons of sarin-cyclosarin and 1.5 metric tons of mustard gas were damaged at Muhammadiyat, and munitions containing 16.8 metric tons of sarin-cyclosarin were damaged at Al Muthanna (PAC, 1996). Atmospheric modeling by CIA - DOD determined that the nearest US personnel - 400 km away - were outside the range of contamination.",

National Academies Press, Washington, DC. The U.S. ARMY is under a congressional mandate and the Chemical Weapons Convention of January 1993 to destroy its entire stockpile of chemical munitions. To ensure that chemical contamination is reduced to safe concentrations at stockpile and NSCM sites before they are used for residential, occupational, or wildlife purposes, the U.S. Army requested that health-based exposure limits for GA, GB, GD, VX, sulfur mustard, and lewisite be developed to protect the public and the environment. The National Research Council subcommittee determined that the Army's interim RfDs for GA, GB, GD, and sulfur mustard were scientifically valid but concluded that the RfDs for VX and lewisite and the SF for sulfur mustard were too high. The bases for those conclusions are described in this report.[Available from, as of July 3, 2007: http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=9644]",

At present, administration of atropine and an oxime are recommended, although effectiveness of this treatment is not proved in clinical trials. Here, monitoring of intoxications with organophosphorus (OP) pesticides may be of help, as their actions are closely related to those of nerve agents and intoxication and therapy follow the same principles. To this end, the clinical course of poisoning and the effectiveness of antidotal therapy were investigated in patients requiring artificial ventilation being treated with atropine and obidoxime. However, poisoning with OP pesticides shows extremely heterogeneous pictures of cholinergic crisis frequently associated with clinical complications. To achieve valuable information for the therapy of nerve agent poisoning, cases resembling situations in nerve agent poisoning had to be extracted: (a) intoxication with OPs forming reactivatable OP-AChE-complexes with short persistence of the OP in the body resembling inhalational sarin intoxication; (b) intoxication with OPs resulting rapidly in an aged OP-AChE-complex resembling inhalational soman intoxication; (c) intoxications with OPs forming a reactivatable AChE-OP complex with prolonged persistence of the OP in the body resembling percutaneous VX intoxication. From these cases it was concluded that sufficient reactivation of nerve agent inhibited non-aged AChE should be possible, if the poison load was not too high and the effective oximes were administered early and with an appropriate duration.../Nerve agents/",

Short-term effects were studied with an acute single subcutaneous dose (s.c.) of 80 ug kg(-1) (0.5 x LD50) sarin. Cortex and cerebellum showed a significant decline in AChE mRNA expression at 2.5, 24 and 72 hr. Biochemical studies showed that plasma butrylcholinesterase (BChE) and brain AChE activities were significantly decreased at 2.5 hr, which came back to near control values by 24 hr in both cases. For long-term chronic studies, three groups of female rats received daily doses of physostigmine (0.1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) intramuscularly (i.m.), sarin (15 ug kg(-1) day(-1)) s.c. independently and a combined dose of physostigmine (i.m.) (0.1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) followed by sarin (s.c.) (15 ug kg(-1) day(-1)) continuously for 30 days. Differential AChE mRNA levels in cortex and cerebellum of rat brain were observed after 30 days and after a lag period of another 30 days with no further administration. Plasma (BChE) and brain (AChE) showed irregular inhibition profile in biochemical studies at 30 days and returned to control levels after 60 days. The acute single subcutaneous administration of sarin for short-term as well as chronic long-term studies showed that AChE inhibition alone does not lead to observed changes in mRNA expression of AChE gene. These observations further suggest that route of administration as well as dose exposure regimen also contributes to the regulation of AChE mRNA expression.",

Animals instrumented for electroencephalogram recording were pretreated with pyridostigmine bromide (0.026 mg/kg im) 30 min before challenge with 2 x LD50 (s.c.) of a nerve agent. In model A, atropine sulfate (2.0 mg/kg im) and pyridine-2-aldoxime methylchloride (2-PAM; 25.0 mg/kg im) were given 1 min after nerve agent challenge, and the tested anticonvulsant was given (im) 5 min after seizure onset. In model B, a lower dose of atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg im) was given along with 2-PAM 1 min after nerve agent challenge, and the anticonvulsant was given at seizure onset. With the lower dose of atropine, seizure occurrence increased to virtually 100% for all agents; the time to seizure onset decreased for sarin, cyclosarin, and VX; the signs of nerve agent intoxication were more severe; and coma resulted frequently with cyclosarin. The anticonvulsant ED50 doses for scopolamine or diazepam were, in general, not different between the two models, whereas the anticonvulsant ED50 values of midazolam increased 3- to 17-fold with the lower atropine dose. Seizure termination times were not systematically affected by the different doses of atropine. The order of anticonvulsant effectiveness within each model was scopolamine > or = midazolam > diazepam. The findings indicate that the dose of atropine given as antidotal therapy can significantly influence measures of nerve agent toxicity and responsiveness to anticonvulsant therapy.",

Both GB and PB produce miosis through stimulation of ocular muscarinic receptors. ... Rats were injected im with saline, 0.04 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, or 1.4 mg/kg of PB twice daily for 8 consecutive days. After day 3, animals injected with 1.4 mg/kg PB developed miotic tolerance. Twenty-four (24) hr following the final PB injection, the rats were exposed to GB vapor (4.0 mg/cu m). A similar magnitude of miosis was observed in all groups after GB exposure. However, the rate of recovery of pupil size in animals pretreated with 0.5 and 1.4 mg/kg PB was significantly increased. Twenty (20) hr following exposure to GB vapor, the pupils of animals pretreated with 1.4 mg/kg PB had recovered to 77% +/- 4% of their pre-exposure baseline, whereas the saline-injected controls had recovered to only 52% +/- 2% of their pre-exposure baseline. The increased rate of recovery does not appear to be a result of protection of pupillary muscarinic receptors by the higher doses of PB, as there was no longer PB present in the animal at the time of GB exposure. These results demonstrate the development of tolerance to the miotic effect of PB following repeated exposures, and also suggest that cross-tolerance between PB and GB occurs. However, because the magnitude of the response was not reduced, the PB pretreatment and its associated miotic cross-tolerance does not appear to diminish the effectiveness of miosis as a biomarker of acute exposure to nerve agent vapor.",

Male Sprague Dawley rats were subcutaneously injected with sublethal doses of soman or sarin, and at various times before and after these treatments, were intravenously injected with different doses of atropine. Atropine alone produced dose dependent limb shake myoclonus, stereotyped sniffing, head movements, and turning. Soman or sarin alone produced tremors, convulsions, chewing movements and hind limb abduction. Pretreatment with atropine inhibited the effects of soman and sarin; however, the effects of atropine were significantly attenuated by sarin. Administration of 5 mg/kg of atropine 6 to 72 hr after exposure to soman or sarin, resulted in significant enhancement of limb shake myoclonus. Atropine induced stereotypes were not affected by soman, but administration of atropine 24 hours after sarin exposure resulted in a significant increase in stereotyped sniffing. The /results suggest/ that brief exposure to potent anticholinergic agents can produce supersensitivity to the effects of low doses of antimuscarinic compounds, and that subjects who are treated with antimuscarinics for anticholinergic poisoning should be observed closely for adverse reactions such as myoclonus.",

Rescue and drug administration should be undertaken by trained staff that are protected by personal protective equipment and equipped with pressure demand, self contained breathing apparatus .... In addition, the use of small portable gas powered ventilators can assure a high quality of essential ventilatory care at the scene. The priority is to remove the casualty from further nerve agent exposure and to establish and maintain a clear airway; supplemental oxygen should be given as required. If possible, the victim's contaminated clothing should be removed to reduce further nerve agent absorption. ... Civilian casualties who have been exposed substantially to a nerve agent should receive antidotal treatment as soon as possible after exposure; the rapid parenteral administration of atropine to patients presenting with rhinorrhea and bronchorrhea may be life-saving. It is also recommended that casualties requiring atropine should also receive immediately whichever oxime is available. ... Severely intoxicated adult casualties may require the administration of the contents of three /autopen injections/ at 5-10 min intervals prior to admission to hospital. Casualties receiving antidotes should be moved to hospital as soon a possible. Casualties who do not develop the features of systemic toxicity, notably rhinorrhea and bronchorrhea, should be triaged but not given atropine or oxime. /Nerve agents/",

Because inhibition of blood cholinesterases is a common feature of sarin, other OP compounds, and some other compounds, cholinesterase inhibition is not a specific biomarker of sarin exposure. Blood esterase activity returns to normal 1-3 months after exposure and this limits its utility as a biomarker to a short time after exposure. ...

During the program, the Army investigated only acute short-term effects. Approximately 6,720 soldiers (between the ages of 20 and 25 years) were exposed at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, to one or more of 254 chemicals in five classes. About 1,406 of the soldiers were exposed to 15 anticholinesterases. Of this group, 246 were tested with sarin under different conditions (e.g., i.v. or inhalation of sarin vapor)... . In a series of reports, the NRC designed and conducted a follow-up survey and examined soldiers' hospitalization and mortality. ... The NRC results and conclusions were based primarily on anticholinesterases as a class, rather than on sarin or cyclosarin. The NRC questionnaire contained 27 outcome variables relating to health, social adjustment, and reproductive experience of the participants. Mailed survey questionnaires were returned by 64 percent of the overall population of soldiers tested. No long-term health consequences were reported by those responding to the questionnaire, including those exposed to anticholinesterases. Nonrespondents reported having had no health problems to report, when contacted later about their reasons for not returning the questionnaire. Nevertheless, the NRC cautioned that the study had low statistical power and that the exposed group was a highly selected, healthier subset than those who were unexposed. Thus, despite no major identifiable long-term effects, the NRC concluded that \"the limited information available from the follow-up on these soldiers does not permit definitive conclusions regarding the nature and extent of possible long-term problems resulting from chemical exposure at Edgewood.\"",

It is a life-threatening paralysis of respiratory, neck, and limb muscles. It appears after recovery from the acute cholinergic syndrome, but before the expected time of onset of delayed neuropathy. The symptoms are reversible and disappear within about 2 weeks. ...  In one uncontrolled study of male U.K. military volunteers (n = 8) exposed to sarin vapors at 15 mg/min/cu m, soldiers quickly displayed some signs of the acute cholinergic syndrome (e.g., miosis and depressed RBC AChE levels). Although soldiers did not experience muscular weakness, they developed a subclinical change detected by single-fiber electromyography of the forearm muscle, an increased \"jitter\" at 3 hours postexposure. Jitter refers to a variation in the time of onset of a second action potential within a motor unit after an initial discharge. Jitter is one indication of potential failure of transmission at the neuromuscular junction. The change in jitter in the soldiers was apparent at about 1 year, but disappeared by the second follow-up at about 2 years postexposure. The findings were interpreted by the authors as possibly a subtle indicator of the onset of the intermediate syndrome, but the intermediate syndrome itself did not become manifest.",

The determination of toxicity by inhalation is important for the rational development of timely therapeutic countermeasures. This study was designed to deliver aerosolized dilute nerve agents in a dose-response manner to investigate the extent of lethality of nerve agents: soman, sarin, VX and VR. Male rats (240-270 g) were anesthetized intramuscularly with 10 mg/kg xylazine and 90 mg/kg ketamine. Following anesthesia, rats were intubated with a glass endotracheal tube (ET) and placed in a glove box. The ET was connected to a closed circuit nebulizer system (Aeroneb, Aerogen, Inc.) that delivered a particle size of < 2.0 um and was in series between the ventilator and the ET. Nerve agents were delivered by a small animal ventilator set for a volume of 2.5 mL x 60-80 breaths/min. VX or VR were nebulized and delivered in concentrations ranging from 6.25-800 ug/kg over a 10-min exposure time period. Sarin (GB) or soman (GD), 6.5-1250 ug/kg, were delivered in a similar manner. Lethality by inhalation occurred either during the 10-min exposure period or less than 15 min after the cessation of exposure. Survivors were euthanized at 24 hr postexposure. LCt(50) /lethal concentration & time that produced deaths in 50% of the tested population/ estimates ( 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were obtained from the sequential stage-wise experiments using the probit analysis. Probit analysis revealed that the LD(50) for VX was 110.7 ug/kg (CI: 73.5-166.7), VR 64.2 ug/kg (CI: 42.1-97.8); soman (GD), 167 ug/kg (CI: 90-310), and sarin (GB), 154 ug/kg (CI: 98-242), respectively. Although VR is a structural isomer of VX, the compounds appear to be markedly different in terms of toxicity when delivered by aerosol. These relationships were converted to actual 10 min LCt(50) equivalents: VX = 632.2, VR = 367, GD = 954.3 and GB = 880 mg min/cu m. Validation of exposure was verified by the determination of blood levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) across doses for the agent VR.",

The subcutaneous doses of nerve agents needed to decrease 24-hr survival of guinea pigs by 50% (LD(50) values) were estimated by probit analysis. In all animal groups, the rank order of LD(50) values was sarin > soman > VX. The LD(50) value of soman was not influenced by sex or age of the animals. In contrast, the LD(50) values of VX and sarin were lower in adult male than in age-matched female or younger guinea pigs. A colorimetric assay was used to determine the concentrations of nerve agents that inhibit in vitro 50% of AChE activity (IC(50) values) in guinea pig brain extracts, plasma, red blood cells, and whole blood. A positive correlation between LD(50) values and IC(50) values for AChE inhibition would support the hypothesis that AChE inhibition is a major determinant of the acute toxicity of the nerve agents. However, such a positive correlation was found only between LD(50) values and IC(50) values for AChE inhibition in brain extracts from neonatal and prepubertal guinea pigs. These results demonstrate for the first time that the lethal potencies of some nerve agents in guinea pigs are age- and sex-dependent. They also support the contention that mechanisms other than AChE inhibition contribute to the lethality of nerve agents.",

Age- and weight-matched male guinea pigs were exposed to five different doses of sarin (169.3, 338.7, 508, 677.4, and 846.5 mg/cu m) using a microinstillation inhalation exposure technique for 4 min. The technique involves aerosolization of the agent in the trachea using a microcatheter with a center hole that delivers the agent and multiple peripheral holes that pumps air to aerosolize the agent at the tip. Animals exposed to higher doses of sarin occasionally developed seizures and succumbed to death within 15 min after exposure. The LCt(50) /lethal concentration & time that produced deaths in 50% of the tested population/ for sarin using the microinstillation technique was determined to be close to 677.4 mg/cu m. Ear blood AChE activity showed a dose-dependent inhibition at 15 min postexposure. The inhibition of blood AChE remained constant over 35 and 55 min after sarin exposure indicating that there was no lung depot effect. Cardiac blood AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity in surviving animals euthanized at 24 hr postexposure showed a dose-dependent inhibition with an inhibition of 60% at 677.4 and 846.5 mg/cu m sarin exposure. AChE and BChE activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) showed a slight increase at 338.7 to 677.4 mg/cu m sarin exposure but a marginal inhibition at 169.3 mg/cu m. In contrast, the AChE protein levels determined by immunoblotting showed an increase at 169.3 mg/cu m in the BALF. The BALF protein level, a biomarker of lung injury, was increased maximally at 338.7 mg/cu m and that increase was dropped with an increase in the dose of sarin. The BALF protein levels correlated with the AChE and BChE activity. These data suggest that sarin microinstillation inhalation exposure results in respiratory toxicity and lung injury characterized by changes in lavage AChE, BChE, and protein levels.",

There is some variability depending on the species and the route of administration. ... The LD50 in the rat and mouse are similar, with sc, im and iv doses requiring 150 to 180 ug/kg. Oral administration requires nearly 10 times more sarin. The hen, guinea pig, and cat are more sensitive than rats and mice, with lethal doses ranging from 16 to 40 ug/kg sc to 561ug/kg oral. The immediate cause of death from sarin poisoning is respiratory arrest. In baboons, sarin administered to the upper airway in vapor form (30 ug/kg) causes apnea within 5 minutes. Since the dose was twice the LD50, mechanical ventilation was needed to keep the animals alive. Their apnea was correlated with the absence of activity in the phrenic nerve (which projects to the diaphragm), suggesting a central effect of sarin on respiration. Respiration recovered spontaneously within 1 to 2 days, although AChE activity was still significantly inhibited.",

The Arg192 isoform hydrolyzes paraoxon rapidly but diazoxon, soman and especially sarin slowly. On the other hand, the Gln192 isoform hydrolyzes paraoxon slowly, but diazoxon, soman and sarin more rapidly than the Arg192 isoform. Our experiments with a mouse model system have convincingly shown that PON1 plays a major role in the detoxication of organophosphate (OP) compounds processed through the P450/PON1 pathway. Recent studies have also shown that PON1 plays an important role in the metabolism of oxidized lipid compounds. Currently, there is an effort underway to identify genes and polymorphisms that play an important role in 'environmental susceptibility'. The PON1 polymorphism has been cited as a prime example of such a genetic polymorphism. ...",

This study determined the acute toxicity of IMPA to golden shiner, Notemigonus crysoleucas, and channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, eggs and 15-days posthatch (dph) fry. The median lethal concentration (LC50) values at time of hatch for golden shiner and channel catfish eggs were 66.6 mg/L (hatched in 72 hr) and 167.5 mg/L (hatched in 168 hr) IMPA, respectively. The 96-hr LC50 estimates for 15-dph golden shiner and channel catfish fry were 93.9 and 144.1 mg/L IMPA, respectively. The lowest LC50 value from the most sensitive species in this study is approximately 100 times greater than the human adult lifetime drinking water health advisory value, and is approximately 2500 times greater than the critical reporting limit (> or =0.025 mg/L) for IMPA detection in groundwater from CWA production. These results are critical in understanding the toxicological properties of this potential environmental contaminant. /Isopropyl methylphosphonic acid/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.86 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates sarin will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase sarin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.6 hours. The UV absorption spectrum of sarin in cyclohexane solution does not exhibit any absorption above 290 nm; therefore, sarin is not expected to degrade through direct photolysis in the environment. If released to soil, sarin is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 16. The importance of leaching in moist soil will be attenuated due to sarin's ability to hydrolyze in water. Laboratory and field studies have demonstrated that sarin evaporates rapidly from non-absorbing surfaces, even at extremely cold temperatures. Two soil persistence studies conducted by the US Army found that 90% or more of sarin added to soil will be lost in the first five days. Biodegradation data for sarin were not available. If released into water, sarin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Hydrolysis will be the major fate process in water. Sarin will degrade through aqueous hydrolysis which is pH and temperature dependent to HF and isopropyl methylphosphonic acid. The fastest rates of hydrolysis occur below pH 4 and above 6.5. In distilled water at 25 \u00b0C, the hydrolysis half-lives range from 75 hr at pH 7 to 0.8 hr at pH 9. The hydrolysis rate increases in seawater due to the catalytic effect of ions; the seawater hydrolysis half-life at pH 7.6 and 25 \u00b0C is about 1 hr. Volatilization from water surfaces occurs slowly. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 76 and 555 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to sarin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where sarin is produced or used in demilitarization operations(SRC). Exposure to sarin occurs through vapor contact which is readily absorbable through not only the lungs and eyes but also the skin and intestinal tract. The general population will not be exposed to sarin unless it is used as a weapon; exposure to sarin, if used as a weapon, will be via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact. (SRC)",

The importance of leaching in moist soil will be attenuated(SRC) due to sarin's ability to hydrolyze in water(4). Volatilization of sarin from both dry and moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) based on results of field and laboratory studies(4). Biodegradation data for sarin were not available(SRC, 2013). Sarin is considered nonpersistent in the environment since it is volatile, soluble in water, and subject to hydrolysis(4).",

Aqueous hydrolysis is expected to be the major degradation process for sarin in water forming the products HF and isopropyl methylphosphonic acid(4). The hydrolysis is pH and temperature dependent(4-6); with the fastest rates of hydrolysis occurring below pH 4 and above 6.5(6), the hydrolysis half-life is about 237 hr at 25 \u00b0C(6). Hydrolysis takes place faster in seawater than in distilled water due to the presence of metal cations in seawater(5,6); the hydrolysis half-lives in seawater at 25 \u00b0C and pHs 7.6 and 7.9 are 58.1 and 25 min, respectively(6); in seawater at 25 \u00b0C, the time required to decompose 99.9% of initial sarin is about 8 hr(6); in distilled water, the time required to decompose 99.9% varies from about 750 to 7.5 hr at pHs of 7.0 to 9.0(6). Sarin has been shown to volatilize slowly from water(5) and its estimated Henry Law constant of 5.7X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 2.86 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(1), and water solubility, and assigned value for water solubility of 1.0X10+6 mg/L (miscible)(7), also indicates that sarin will volatilize slowly from water surfaces(8). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(8), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 76 and 555 days, respectively(SRC). Hydrolysis will attenuate the environmental importance of volatilization(SRC). According to a classification scheme(9), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 0.30(10) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation data for sarin were not available(SRC, 2013). Sarin is considered nonpersistent in the environment since it is volatile, soluble in water, and subject to hydrolysis(4).",

Vapor-phase sarin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.6 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 9.6 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Sarin, an organophosphate containing fluorine, hydrolyzes rapidly in water under alkaline conditions(2). The hydrolysis of sarin in water is pH and temperature dependent(3,4); in the pH range 4 to 6.5, the hydrolysis half-life is approximately the same and has been determined to be 1870 hr at 10 \u00b0C, 461 hr at 20 \u00b0C and 237 hr at 25 \u00b0C(3). Below pH 4 and above pH 6.5, the hydrolysis rate increases dramatically(3); at 25 \u00b0C, the hydrolysis half-lives at pHs 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 are 75, 24, 7.5 0.8 hr, respectively(3). Hydrolysis products include hydrogen fluoride and isopropyl methylphosphonic acid(4). The presence of metal cations in seawater markedly increases the hydrolysis rate(3,4); the hydrolysis half-lives in seawater at 25 \u00b0C and pHs 7.6 and 7.9 are 58.1 and 25 min, respectively(4); in seawater at 25 \u00b0C, the time required to decompose 99.9% of initial sarin is about 8 hr(4); in distilled water, the time required to decompose 99.9% varies from about 750 to 7.5 hr at pHs of 7.0 to 9.0(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that sarin may volatilize slowly from water surfaces(3). It has been shown that the vapors above a water solution at 25 \u00b0C containing 140 ug/L sarin will contain 0.0004 ug/L sarin(1) which demonstrates an ability to volatilize slowly from water(SRC). Based on the Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 76 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 555 days(SRC). With hydrolysis half-lives on the order of 24 to 237 hours at 25 \u00b0C(4), hydrolysis will attenuate any importance of volatilization from water(SRC). The potential for volatilization of sarin from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon its vapor pressure(SRC). Under ordinary atmospheric conditions, sarin has sufficiently high volatility to permit evaporation into air(5). At 10 \u00b0C, the time required for 90% of 1-mm-diameter droplets of sarin to evaporate from non-absorbing surfaces is only 0.24 hr(6); at 0 \u00b0C and -20 \u00b0C, the evaporation times are 0.58 hr and 1.8 hr, respectively(7). In field studies in Norway using snow, 55% of applied sarin was removed by evaporation within 5 hours(4).",

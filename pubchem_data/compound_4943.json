ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Weight was found to be a significant covariate for elimination clearance, the two intercompartmental clearances, and the volumes of the central compartment, the shallow peripheral compartment, and the deep peripheral compartment; power functions with exponents smaller than 1 yielded the best results. The estimates of these parameters for a 70-kg adult were 1.44 l/min, 2.25 l/min, 0.92 l/min, 9.3 l, 44.2 l, and 266 l, respectively. For patients older than 60 yr the elimination clearance decreased linearly. The volume of the central compartment decreased with age. For children, all parameters were increased when normalized to body weight. Venous data showed a decreased elimination clearance; bolus data were characterized by increases in the volumes of the central and shallow peripheral compartments and in the rapid distribution clearance (Cl2) and a decrease in the slow distribution clearance (Cl3). Pharmacokinetics of propofol can be well described by a three-compartment model. Inclusion of age and weight as covariates significantly improved the model. Adjusting pharmacokinetics to the individual patient should improve the precision of target-controlled infusion and may help to broaden the field of application for target-controlled infusion systems.",

The major metabolites were the glucuronic acid conjugate of propofol and the glucuronic acid and sulfate conjugates of its hydroxylated derivative, 2,6-diisopropyl-1,4-quinol. Propofol glucuronide accounted for about 53% of the urinary radioactivity and was the major metabolite in plasma from 30 min post dose. The blood concentration of propofol declined in a biphasic manner from a maximum mean value of 0.44 ug/ml, 2 min after injection. The half-lives of the first and second exponential phases, mean values 5 min and 97 min respectively, varied widely among subjects. A proportion of the dose was cleared slowly, probably due to slow release from less well perfused tissues. Propofol accounted for 94% of the total blood radioactivity at 2 min but only about 6% from 3 to 8 hr post dose.

The rate constant calculated from the disappearance of propofol in an incubation mixture with human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYP isoforms was used as a measure of the rate of metabolism of propofol. The correlation of these rate constants with rates of metabolism of CYP isoform-selective substrates by liver microsomes, the effect of CYP isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies on propofol metabolism by liver microsomes, and its metabolism by recombinant human CYP isoforms were examined. The mean rate constant of propofol metabolism by liver microsomes obtained from 6 individuals was 4.2 (95% confidence intervals 2.7, 5.7) nmol/min/mg protein. The rate constants of propofol by microsomes were significantly correlated with S-mephenytoin N-demethylation, a marker of CYP2B6 (r=0.93, P<0.0001), but not with the metabolic activities of other CYP isoform-selective substrates. Of the chemical inhibitors of CYP isoforms tested, orphenadrine, a CYP2B6 inhibitor, reduced the rate constant of propofol by liver microsomes by 38% (P<0.05), while other CYP isoform-selective inhibitors had no effects. Of the recombinant CYP isoforms screened, CYP2B6 produced the highest rate constant for propofol metabolism (197 nmol/min/nmol P450). An antibody against CYP2B6 inhibited the disappearance of propofol in liver microsomes by 74% /and SRP: reduced in vitro metabolism by blocking CYP 2B6/. Antibodies raised against other CYP isoforms had no effect on the metabolism of propofol. CYP2B6 is predominantly involved in the oxidation of propofol by human liver microsomes.",

It is highly protein bound in vivo and is metabolised by conjugation in the liver. Propofol is metabolized mainly by glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and by hydroxylation by CYP2B6 and CYP2C enzymes. The enzymes SULT1A1 and NQO1 participate in later steps in propofol metabolism. An unidentified route of extrahepatic metabolism may also exist, suggested by the fact that propofol clearance exceeds estimated hepatic blood flow. (L1002, A600, A304). Propofol is hepatically metabolized mainly by glucuronidation at the C1-hydroxyl. Hydroxylation of the benzene ring to 4-hydroxypropofol may also occur via CYP2B6 and 2C9 with subsequent conjugation to sulfuric and/or glucuronic acid. Hydroxypropofol has approximately 1/3 of hypnotic activity of propofol. \nRoute of Elimination: It is chiefly eliminated by hepatic conjugation to inactive metabolites which are excreted by the kidney.\nHalf Life: Initial distribution phase t<sub>1/2&alpha;</sub>=1.8-9.5 minutes. Second redistirubtion phase t<sub>1/2&beta;</sub>=21-70 minutes. Terminal elimination phase t<sub>1/2&gamma;</sub>=1.5-31 hours. ",

It is marked by combinations of cardiac bradyarrhythmias, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency and death from cardiovascular collapse. The syndrome generally arises after 2 to 3 days of sedation in association with use of higher doses of propofol (>5 mg/kg/hour) and may be more common in children than adults. Early termination of the propofol infusion can result in reversal of the syndrome, but the mortality rate in published series has been greater than 50%. On autopsy, patients with the propofol infusion syndrome may have hepatic microvesicular steatosis, explaining the lactic acidosis that frequently accompanies the muscle and heart abnormalities. However, jaundice and marked elevations in typical liver associated enzymes in this syndrome are uncommon. In some instances, both the urine and the liver have been described as being green in color, returning to normal soon after propofol is stopped. A mild form of this syndrome may occur earlier during infusions, as shown by lactic acidosis arising within 2 to 24 hours of starting propofol which is rapidly reversed upon stopping. More than 50 instances of propofol infusion syndrome have been described in the literature with a high mortality rate, although most deaths were due to cardiac involvement. Some instances of propofol infusion syndrome and lactic acidosis have been associated with higher than expected plasma levels of propofol, perhaps due to idiosyncratic differences in pharmacokinetics or miscalculation of administered dose.",

Although one expert panel recommends withholding nursing for an unspecified time after propofol administration, most recommend that breastfeeding can be resumed as soon as the mother has recovered sufficiently from general anesthesia to nurse and that discarding milk is unnecessary. When a combination of anesthetic agents is used for a procedure, follow the recommendations for the most problematic medication used during the procedure. General anesthesia for cesarean section using propofol as a component for induction may delay the onset of lactation. In one study, breastfeeding before general anesthesia induction reduced requirements of propofol and sevoflurane compared to those of nursing mothers whose breastfeeding was withheld or nonnursing women. Case reports have noted blue-green or green discoloration of breastmilk after nursing mothers received propofol.",

Fentanyl 1 to 1.5 mcg/kg was administered after delivery. Patients in the general anesthesia group (n = 21) had higher post-procedure prolactin levels and a longer mean time to lactation initiation (25 hours) than in the other groups (10.8 to 11.8 hours). Postpartum oxytocin levels in the nonmedicated vaginal delivery group were higher than in the general and spinal anesthesia groups.",

During the procedure she received cefazolin, granisetron, ketorolac, rocuronium, succinylcholine, and sufentanil. The patient also received 2 boluses of intravenous propofol of 150 mg followed shortly thereafter by a 50 mg dose. Postoperatively, she was receiving acetaminophen, cefazolin, ibuprofen, and pantoprazole, as well as oxycodone and dimenhydrinate as needed. Twenty-two hours after the procedure, the mother extracted milk for the first time and noted it to be light green in color. Analysis of the green milk using a nonvalidated assay detected no propofol. The green color faded and was absent by postoperative day 4 when she resumed breastfeeding. The authors judged that the green color was possibly caused by propofol or one of its metabolites.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.1X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propofol will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase propofol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be7.3 hours. If released to soil, propofol is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2700. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Propofol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Propofol may biodegrade in soil based on the biodegradability of the structurally similar compound, 2,6-dimethylphenol, which achieved 30-100 percent and 94 percent biodegradation in activated sludge screening tests after 14 days and 5 days, respectively. If released into water, propofol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Propofol may biodegrade in water based on the biodegradability of the structurally similar compound, 2,6-dimethylphenol. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 23 days and 170 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 6.5 years when adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 170 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms to be high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to propofol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propofol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to propofol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing propofol.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 23 days and 170 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 6.5 years when adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 170(SRC), from an estimated log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). Propofol may biodegrade in the aquatic environment based on the biodegradability of the structurally similar compound, 2,6-dimethylphenol, which achieved 30-100 percent and 94 percent biodegradation in activated sludge screening tests after 14 days and 5 days, respectively(8,9).",

However, data were found for the structurally similar compound 2,6-dimethylphenol. 2,6-Dimethylphenol, present at 100 ppm with a microbial population of 30 mg/l, reached 30 to 100 percent of its theoretical biological oxygen demand after 14 days in a Japanese MITI aerobic activated sludge screening test(1). A similar screening test resulted in 94 percent biodegradation in activated sludge after 5 days(2). Based on the biodegradation data for this structurally similar compound, propofol may biodegrade in the natural environment. However, biodegradation of propofol may be slower than that of 2,6-dimethylphenol due to the increased branching of the isopropyl groups of propofol compared to the methyl groups of 2,6-dimethylphenol(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

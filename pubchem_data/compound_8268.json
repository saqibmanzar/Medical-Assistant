When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Contact with dicofol may cause burns to the skin and eyes, possibly severe. Moreover, acute exposure to dicofol may even be fatal, regardless the route (ie, dermal, inhalation, or ingestion). When a potentially serious exposure situation exists, wear a positive-pressure breathing apparatus, and special protective clothing. Also, remove any contaminated clothing and wash skin thoroughly before leaving the exposure site. Dicofol will not ignite easily (flashpoint 120 \u00b0F, closed cup), but it will burn with the possible evolution of highly toxic fumes and poisonous gases. For small fires involving dicofol, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, or foam, and for large fires, use water spray, or foam. Runoff from fire control water may give off poisonous gases or cause water pollution and should therefore, be diked for later disposal. Containers of dicofol are not required to bear a label, and they may be shipped by all major modes of transportation. However, certain storage precautions do apply. Dicofol should be stored away from alkali, acids or acid fumes, and feed or foodstuffs. Also, storage temperature should not be less than 40 \u00b0F. Small spills of dicofol should be carefully shovelled (liquid dicofol is first absorbed by non-combustible material, eg, sand) into a clean, dry container for later disposal). Large land spills are diked or deposited in excavated pits, ponds, or other holding areas (dry spills covered with plastic sheet) for later disposal. For large spills on water, activated carbon should be applied to remove immobilized masses of pollutants and precipitates. Before permanent land disposal of dicofol, consult with environmental regulatory agencies.",

It may reduce potassium transport across the membrane. Dicofol also alters the porous channels through which sodium ions pass. These channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization. Dicofol inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. Dicofol also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. Difocol is also an endocrine disruptor and binds both the androgen and estrogen receptor. In addition, it may alter sex hormone metabolism by directly inhibiting cytochrome P-450 19A1. Difocol is able to competitively bind transthyretin, which lowers plasma thyroid hormone levels. (T10, A214, A228, A229)",

Aspirate oral and pharyngeal secretion, and when possible, insert an oropharyngeal airway to maintain an open passage unobstructed by the tongue. Minimize noise and any manipulation of the patient that may trigger seizure activity. Seizures in patients caused by organochlorine toxicity are likely to be prolonged and difficult to control. Status epilepticus is common. For this reason, patients with seizures that do not respond immediately to anticonvulsants should be transferred as soon as possible to a trauma center and will generally require intensive care admission until seizures are controlled and neurologic status is improved.

The skin was abraded and clothing contaminated. The patient had initial symptoms of nausea, dizziness, disorientation, confusion, lethargy and headache. The patient demonstrated horizontal nystagmus and impaired balance. These symptoms resolved within three weeks. Three weeks after the incident, serum dicofol levels were 1.1 ug/L and adipose tissue levels were 0.153 ug/kg (analytical methods unspecified). No dicofol was detected in serum one week after the exposure. Following persistent emotional difficulties, the patient underwent a neuropsychological evaluation eight months after the exposure, which showed impairment of certain cognitive functions including auditory attention, immediate memory, and ability to selectively inhibit inappropriate responses. A pre-exposure neuropsychological analysis was unavailable for comparison.",

The data were derived from a hospital-based multi-site case-control study carried out in 5 rural areas between 1990-92. In the study, 124 new cases of prostate cancer were ascertained and interviewed, along with 659 cancer controls. A team of agronomists assessed past exposure to pesticides by using a checklist of 100 chemical families and 217 compounds applied from 1950-85 in the areas considered. The association between prostate cancer and different occupational risk factors was measured by maximum likelihood estimation of the odds ratio, controlling for potential confounders. \"Ever been employed in agriculture\" was associated with a 40% increased risk (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 0.9-2.0). Prostate cancer was also related positively to food and tobacco (OR= 2.1, 95% CI = 1.1-4.1), and chemical products (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 0.7-7.2) industries. The analyses carried out to estimate the association between different types of pesticides and prostate cancer showed increased risks among farmers exposed to organochlorine insecticides and acaricides (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.4-4.2), more specifically to the often contemporary used compounds DDT (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.2-3.8), and dicofol (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.5-5.0), whose effects could not be well separated.",

An additional group of 10 guinea pigs was also treated with 80% v/v aqueous ethanol in the same manner and served as a vehicle control group. These two groups of animals and a group of 10 naive control guinea pigs were challenged 2 weeks after the last induction dose with 0.4 mL of 11.7% w/v dicofol in acetone.

Seven days after the primary challenge, the 20 dicofol induced guinea pigs as well as a second group of naive control guinea pigs received a rechallenge dose of 11.7% w/v dicofol in acetone and were scored similarly.

The low incidence of erythema in the dicofol induced group following the challenge and rechallenge phases, although not statistically different from the control groups, was considered indicative of a weak delayed contact hypersensitivity response.",

Residues of dicofol and its metabolites were then analyzed in the eggs and carcasses of females. Significant differences occurred among treatments for residues of both p,p'-dicofol and p,p'-dichlorodicofol (DCD) in both eggs and carcasses and for p,p'-dicholorbenzophenone (DCBP) in eggs. Residue concentrations increased with increasing treatment exposure. Residues of p,p'-dicofol, p,p'-DCD, and p,p'-DCBP in eggs were significantly correlated with eggshell quality parameters. Significant correlations also occurred among contaminants in eggs and for individual contaminants between eggs and carcasses. The lowest-observed-dietary-effect concentration for eggshell thinning was 3 ug/g, whereas 1 ug/g may be considered to be near a no-observable-adverse-effect concentration. Concentrations of dicofol in potential prey items and eggs of wild birds generally have been lower than dietary-effect concentrations or concentrations in tissues or eggs associated with eggshell thinning and reduced reproductive success.",

Carp testicular microsomes incubated in the presence of androstenedione and different xenobiotics evidenced higher sensitivity of 5alpha-reductase activity than 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity towards those chemicals. Dicofol, organotins and phthalates were among the most effective inhibitors. In contrast, ovarian synthesis of maturation-inducing hormones (20alpha- and 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities) were enhanced by nonylphenol, dicofol, fenarimol and p,p'-DDE. Metabolic clearance pathways of hormones were also affected...",

Compared to the control, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at 0.64 mg/L, dicofol at 0.8 and 1.2 mg/L, endosulfan at 7.0 mg/L, and lindane at 14.0 mg/L all significantly decreased the population growth rate of the rotifers. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at concentrations higher than 0.16 mg/L, dicofol at concentrations higher than 0.025 mg/L, endosulfan at concentrations higher than 0.875 mg/L, and lindane at 14.0 mg/L all significantly decreased the mictic rate of the rotifers. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at 0.24 and 0.32 mg/L increased significantly the fertilization rate, but DDT at 0.64 mg/L inhibited completely the occurrence of fertilized mictic females. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at 0.32 and 0.64 mg/L, dicofol at 1.2 mg/L, and endosulfan at 7.0 mg/L all significantly decreased the ratio of ovigerous females to nonovigerous females, but the reverse was true for lindane at 7.0 mg/L. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at 0.0025 and 0.01 mg/L increased significantly the ratio of mictic females to amictic females, but the reverse was true for dicofol at 0.8 mg/L. Both population growth rate and mictic rate of the rotifers were suitable endpoints for assessing the effects of the four organochlorine insecticides on the reproduction of the rotifers, and the latter was more sensitive.",

In 1992, more than 70% of dicofol product sold annually in the US was applied in CA, AZ, TX, and FL. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.98X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dicofol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dicofol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.7 days. Particulate-phase dicofol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Dicofol absorbs light >290 nm (molar absorptivity of 211 at 295-305 nm) which suggests that photolysis may be an important degradation process in the atmosphere. If released to soil, dicofol is expected to have no mobility based upon a Koc range of 5017 in silty loam to 8383 in sand. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation of dicofol on soil may occur, based upon a degradation half-life of 43 days on a silt loam soil. Hydrolysis of dicofol will occur in moist soils, especially at pH values >7. Laboratory and field studies indicate that dicofol has a short to intermediate half-life (days to months) and is moderately persistent in the environment as a result of normal label uses. In ecological monitoring studies conducted in NY, FL, and CA, dicofol dissipated from the soil surface with a half-life ranging from 2 to 4 months. If released into water, dicofol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Dicofol biodegradation in aquatic systems is expected to occur based upon its degradation in soils. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. BCFs of 6100 in carp to 18,900 in fathead minnow suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis of dicofol is expected; hydrolysis rates of 0.00815, 0.168, and 38.4/day were given for pH 5, 7 and 9, giving half-lives of 85 days, 5.8 hours and 26 min, respectively. Occupational exposure to dicofol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dicofol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dicofol via ingestion of food containing dicofol residues. (SRC)",

Volatilization of dicofol from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 3.98X10-7 mm Hg(3), and water solubility, 0.8 mg/L(3). Dicofol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(3). The hydrolysis half-lives for dicofol range from 85 days at pH 5 to 26 min at pH 9 in aqueous solution(2). Photolysis on soil is not an important route of degradation for dicofol, possibly due to binding on the soil and lack of solubility in soil water(4). Biodegradation of dicofol on soil is expected to occur based upon a degradation half-life of 43 days on a silt loam soil(4). The major metabolites were 1,1-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethanol, p,p'-DCBP, and 3-hydroxy-4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone(4). Volatile residues were 21-22% of the applied and unextractable residues were 10-15% of the applied after 12 months(4).",

In ecological monitoring studies conducted in NY, FL, and CA, dicofol dissipated from the soil surface with a half-life ranging from 2 to 4 months. The major routes of dissipation appear to be hydrolysis in neutral and alkaline pHs and microbially-mediated degradation. Mobility and volatilization do not significantly contribute to the dissipation of dicofol in soil. In a dissipation study on cotton in CA, half of dicofol residues dissipated in <7 days from the top 6 inches of soil. In another dissipation study on strawberries in CA, the rate of dissipation was slower with a half-life of 72 days. Differences of dissipation rates were related to greater amounts of irrigation in the cotton study. Results of these studies suggest that metabolism is the dominant route of dissipation in the field. Neither dicofol nor its residues moved significantly below 6 inches in either study. The major degradation products observed in these field studies were o,p' and p,p'-dichlorobenzophenone, 2,4'-dichlorobenzhydrol, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 1,1-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethanol. Comprehensive ecological monitoring studies of dicofol residues were conducted for three years in CA cotton fields, FL citrus groves, and NY apple orchards. In these studies, the overall half-lives of dicofol residues in soils varied from 58 days in CA to 113 days in FL. In NY, it was impossible to calculate a half-life in the 90 day observation period. Dicofol residues were detected in the foliage of crops and dissipated with a half-life ranging from 9 days in cotton to 61 days in citrus crops(1).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 3.98X10-7 mm Hg(3), and water solubility, 0.8 mg/L(3). According to a classification scheme(5), BCFs of 6100 in carp(6) to 18,900 in fathead minnow(7), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Hydrolysis of dicofol is expected; hydrolysis rates of 0.00815, 0.168, and 38.4/day were given for pH 5, 7 and 9 giving half-lives of 85 days, 5.8 hours and 26 min, respectively(2). Dicofol biodegraded after a 60 day anaerobic incubation, with a half-life of <30 days, major degradation products were 4,4'-dichlorobenzhydrol and 1,1-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethanol(8). The aqueous photolysis rate constant of dicofol at 25 \u00b0C is 0.0185/day; the half-life for this reaction is 37 days(2).",

Vapor-phase dicofol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.7 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.4X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase dicofol may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). The half-life for direct photolysis on thin films of dicofol exposed to light with an output maximum of 300 nm was 6 days(4). Dicofol absorbs light >290 nm (molar absorptivity of 211 and at 295-305 nm)(4) which suggests that photolysis may be an important degradation process in the atmosphere.",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 4.7 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Dichlorobenzophenone is a major degradation product in abiotic transformation of dicofol(2,3). Hydrolysis rate constants for dicofol are 0.00815, 0.168 and 38.4/day at pH 5, 7 and 9, respectively; these correspond to hydrolysis half-lives of 85 days, 64-99 hours, and 26 min(4). Dicofol is stable in acids, but unstable in alkaline media, being hydrolysed to 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone and chloroform; the 2,4'-isomer is hydrolyzed more rapidly(5). Dicofol is degraded by light to 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone and is stable at >80 \u00b0C(5). Dicofol photodegraded with a half-life of 92 days in a pH 5 solution, the major degradation product was p,p'-dichlorobenzophenone(4). The half-life of the dark control was 149-246 days(6). At an initial dicofol residue concn of 713.4 ppm, concns decreased to 472.3 ppm after 15 days exposure of ultraviolet light irradiation filtered through Pyrex glass (> 290 nm wavelength) on apple pomace in a closed system, with 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone as the only degradation product detected(7). Dicofol absorbs light >290 nm (molar absorptivity of 211 at 295-305 nm)(8) which suggests that photolysis may be an important degradation process in the environment. The aqueous photolysis of dicofol at 25 \u00b0C is 0.0185/day; the half-life for this reaction is 37 days(4). Photolysis on soil is not an important route of degradation for dicofol, possibly due to binding on the soil and lack of solubility in soil water(6). Upon penetrating into plants, dicofol decomposes into 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone and 4-chlorobenzoic acid(9).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Water samples from the San Joaquin River taken on June 21, July 26, August 24 and September 28, 1993 had dicofol concns of 0, 40, 71 and 51 ng/L, respectively(2). Tributaries which fed into the San Joaquin River sampled on July 15, 1993 had dicofol concns of 500, 900, 850, and 1400 ng/L in the Central California Irrigation District Canal, Spanish Grant Drain, Salt Slough, and Orestimba Creek, respectively(2). Dicofol was detected 3 times (total number of samples not listed) in surface waters from South Florida, Nov 1991 to June 1995, at a max concn of 0.08 ug/L(3). Maximum dicofol concns reported for sampled surface water adjacent to treated citrus groves in Florida ranged from 21 ppb at the time of application to 140 ppb seven days after application, and up to 52 ppb 90 days after application(4). The annual time-weighted average geometric mean concns for the surface waters at all 3 study areas (CA, FL and NY) ranged from 0.4 to 1.1 ppb(4). Dicofol was not detected in a South Florida Water Management District study of samples collected regularly from 27 surface water sites between 1988 and 1993 (detection limits were generally 0.002-0.18 ppm)(4). Dicofol was detected in Orestimba Creek, CA at concns of 0.2-2.5 ug/L, with leaching from adjacent fields as the possible source(5). Dicofol was not detected in surface water samples taken 1997, 1999 and 2000 from sites in Jaipur, India(6). Dicofol was detected in surface water at 0.007-10.51 ug/L in 21 samples taken in 1996 from Thailand(7). Dicofol was detected in water samples collected Sept to Nov 2003 and June to Aug 2004 from Guanting reservoir, Beijing, at not detected to 2.60 ng/L(8).",

In US market basket surveys conducted in 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, and 1976, dicofol was detected in 13 of 360 samples, 9 of 420 samples, 3 of 360 samples, 3 and 360 samples, 3 of 240 samples, and 4 of 240 samples, respectively(2). In one US market basket survey conducted from 1969-76, dicofol was detected in 174 of 3281 domestic large fruits at an avg concn of 0.015 ppm and in 27 of 1048 imported large fruits at an avg concn of 0.005 ppm(2). During the same study, dicofol was detected in 155 of 1445 domestic small fruits at an avg concn of 0.062 ppm and in 85 of 2119 imported small fruits at 0.037 ppm; in 4 of 5319 domestic leaf and stem vegetables at an avg concn of 0.0001 ppm; in 2 of 2954 domestic vine and ear vegetables at an avg concn of 0.0001 ppm and in 16 of 4117 imported vine and ear vegetables at an avg concn of 0.0003 ppm; in 2 of 499 domestic beans at an avg concn of 0.001 ppm; in 9 of 631 domestic processed vegetables at an avg concn of 0.005 ppm and in 1 of 929 imported processed vegetables at a concn of 0.005 ppm(2). In a US market basket survey, conducted from Aug 1976-Sept 1977, dicofol was detected in 2 of 300 adult total diet composite samples ranging from 5-26 ppb(3). In a US market basket survey, conducted from Oct 1977 to Sept 1978, dicofol was detected in 4 of 340 adult total diet composite samples ranging from 5-16 ppb(4). Dicofol was detected by the FDA Los Angeles District on 15 various agricultural commodities at concns of <0.05 to 1 ppm(5). Dicofol was detected (concns not specified) in the 1992 study of 16,428 food samples conducted by the FDA(6). Dicofol was found in 5 of 20 fruit samples for adults at concns of 0.004-0.015 ppm with a mean of 0.0020 ppm (FDA: Total Adult Diet Study Oct 1978 - Sept 1979)(7).

The exposure of nine pesticide applicators in a commercial greenhouse facility was assessed at no detection to 0.12 mg dicofol/kg sprayed(3). A study of the Ontario, Canada flower industry revealed that the average number of applications of dicofol in greenhouses growing chrysanthemums was 12 times per year, however concns used and human exposure data were not presented(4). The total daily exposure to dicofol of 2 citrus spray crews operating in Florida was studied in 1983(5). To measure the amount of dicofol the workers were exposed to, the researchers studied the amount of 4,4'-dichlorobenzilic acid in urinary excretions. 4,4'-Dichlorobenzilic acid is the metabolite of dicofol in humans(5). The mean dietary excretion of 4,4'-dichlorobenzilic acid in urine samples ranged from 18.8 to 41.6 ug/day(5). The average half-life of the post-exposure decline in urinary 4,4'-dichlorobenzilic acid was 6.9 days(5).",

Daily intakes of dicofol were 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.06, 0.6, and 0.6 ug/day for the surveys conducted in 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, and 1976, respectively(2). In 1982-84 a national study was performed that showed the average daily intake (ng/kg body weight/day) of dicofol in the US for children 6 to 11 mo of age (15.6) and 2 yr old (30.7); for females age 14-16 (5.0), 25-30 (5.4) and 60-65 (8.3); for males age 14-16 (5.9), 25-30 (4.2) and 60-65 (7.2)(3). The estimated dietary exposure of dicofol was studied in Jacksonville, Florida from 1982-84, 1986-87, and 1987; the estimated mean dietary exposure was 364 ng/day, 1540 ng/day and 300 ng/day, respectively(4). The estimated mean dietary exposure of dicofol for Springfield/Chicopee, MA residents was 375 ng/day, studied from 1982-1984(4). The average daily intake of dicofol was estimated by the FDA from 1986-1991 based on average residue levels detected in food samples(5). The average daily intake of dicofol for females 6-11 months, 2 yrs, 14-16 yrs, 25-30 yrs and 60-65 yrs, was 0.0196, 0.0355, 0.0076, 0.0083, and 0.0136 ug/kg body wt/day, respectively; for males 14-16 yrs, 25-30 yrs, and 60-65 yrs, avg daily intake was 0.0079, 0.0055, and 0.0118 ug/kg body wt/day, respectively(5). In a Canada total diet study from 1976-78, the avg daily intake of dicofol was 0.002 ug/kg body wt/day(6). Farmers from Jutland, Denmark were divided into 3 groups, where the commodities from organic production contributed no (0%), medium (1-49%) or a high (51-100%) proportion of the fruit and vegetables consumed; average daily intakes of dicofol were 1.014, 1.033 and 0.357 ug/person day, from each of the three groups, respectively, showing that farmers having a high intake of only organic grown commodities have lower levels of dietary pesticide intake(7). The avg daily intake was calculated to be 0.002 mg/kg day(7).",

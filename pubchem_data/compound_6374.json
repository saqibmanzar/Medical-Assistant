It is a relatively water-insoluble yellow solid that is chemically reactive in free-radical reactions. Due to its antimicrobial properties following topical administration, minimal levels of iodoform may be found in disinfectants and it is more primarily used for veterinary purposes. Iodoform has also been found in dental paste and root canal filling materials in combination with other intracanal medications due to its radiopacity. Since the beginning of the 20th century, iodoform has been commonly used as a healing and antiseptic dressing or powder for wounds and sores, however such clinical use to this date is limited. Iodoform is soluble in fatty acids and decomposes releasing iodine in nascent state (96,7% of iodine) when in contact with secretions or endodontic infections.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In a comparative study of wound dressing agents, iodoform gauze exerted an antibacterial effect 3 hours after the start of bacterial growth of _E. coli_ and subsequently maintained the strong antibacterial effectiveness. A study demonstrated that direct and indirect exposure to high concentrations of iodoform induces a cytotoxic effect on cultures of macrophages and epithelial cells _in vitro_, while cell proliferation was enhanced at low concentrations of iodoform. This cytotoxic effect of iodoform in root canals may further lead to long-term local irritation to follicles of permanent successors and formation of cyst-like radiolucent defects.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Iodoform may also play a role in chemical debridement for effective necrotic wound healing and tissue damage repair via collagen fibrinolysis; upon treatment in necrotic tissue, iodoform reduced the size of the macromolecules containing collagen I in wound surface proteins. In human gingival fibroblasts _in vitro_, high concentrations of iodoform was shown to decrease the viability of macrophages and epithelial cells and reduced the secretion of _P. gingivalis_-induced TNF\u03b1. P. gingivalis is an anaerobic bacteria present in anaerobic oral niches including periapical sites and periodontal pockets.",

                                "Description": "The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical is an airborne concentration at which a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effect.  There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Its present use is rather limited. It is sometimes formed in drinking water during the chlorination process. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.040 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates iodoform will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase iodoform will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 56 days. Iodoform absorbs light >290 nm and therefore there is a potential for direct photolysis. If released to soil, iodoform is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 35. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Iodoform's biodegradation potential in soil or water is unknown. If released into water, iodoform is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 40 hours and 25 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 43 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process because the estimated hydrolysis rate is low. Occupational exposure to iodoform may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where iodoform is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to iodoform in some drinking water. Direct human exposure occurs when iodoform is applied to a wound. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 40 hours and 25 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 43(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 3.03(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 55 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 1.72X10-8 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(2); this corresponds to half-lives of more than a million years at pH values of 7 to 8(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

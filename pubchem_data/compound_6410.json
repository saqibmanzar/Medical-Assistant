ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Addition of concentrations of hydroperoxides equimolar with respect to GSH in the erythrocytes or whole blood quantitatively oxidizes GSH in the erythrocytes with a half-time of 4.5 s at 37 \u00b0C and about three times as long at 4 \u00b0C. In the presence of glucose, normal erythrocytes regenerate all the GSH in about 25 min. However, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient erythrocytes failed to regenerate GSH. Treatment of erythrocytes with hydroperoxides does not affect erythrocyte survival in rabbits. Oxidation of erythrocyte GSH with equimolar concentrations of hydroperoxides does not lead to formation of mixed disulfides of hemoglobin and GSH. The hydroperoxides do not affect erythrocyte glycolytic and hexose monophosphate-shunt-pathway enzymes. Previous studies on transport of GSSG from erythrocytes were confirmed by using t-butyl hydroperoxide to oxidize erythrocyte GSH.",

In vivo studies are limited, and the hemoglobin-thiyl radical was the only species thus far identified in the blood of treated rats. Here we further examine t-BOOH metabolism in vivo with regard to free radical and DNA adduct production. Spin-trapping experiments with phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) led to the detection of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals in the blood, bile, and organic extracts of the liver and stomach of rats treated with t-BOOH. Analysis of these signals demonstrated that t-BOOH metabolism in vivo produces alkyl radicals, detected in the bile and organic extracts of liver and stomach, in addition to the previously identified hemoglobin-thiyl radical. To characterize the produced alkyl radicals, experiments were performed with (13)C-labeled t-BOOH and two spin traps, PBN and alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN). The latter was used because the EPR signals obtained with PBN were too weak to be unambiguous. Nevertheless, the EPR signals present in the bile of animals treated with (13)C-labeled t-BOOH and PBN or POBN were consistent with adducts of (13)C-labeled methyl radical and an unidentified alkyl radical. The latter is probably derived from lipids oxidized by the metabolically produced primary radicals, methyl and its precursor, tert-butoxyl. The presence of 8-methylguanine and 7-methylguanine in hydrolysates of DNA from liver and stomach of rats treated with t-BOOH was also examined. 8-Methylguanine, a typical product of methyl radical attack on DNA, was detectable in both the liver and stomach of treated rats. The results may be relevant to the understanding of the genotoxic properties of other peroxides, particularly of cumene hydroperoxide.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Morphological and biochemical analyses of these cells revealed that the mode of cell death was necrosis. Cell killing induced by the hydroperoxide seems to be in part mediated by peroxynitrite because the lethal response was markedly and similarly reduced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methylester and by scavengers of nitric oxide or peroxynitrite. This peroxynitrite-dependent mechanism of cytotoxicity was blunted by antioxidants and inhibitors of mitochondrial permeability transition and the onset of cell death was preceded by mitochondrial depolarization and loss of cellular ATP. We conclude that tert-butylhydroperoxide promotes peroxynitrite-dependent PC12 cell necrosis causally linked to peroxidation of membrane lipids and mitochondrial permeability transition.",

The much wider range of molecular species available in the corn oil permitted us to demonstrate that the yield of the adducts varies with the degree of unsaturation of the triacylglycerol. The highest yields were obtained for the linoleate (20%, of linoleoyl-containing residual triacylglycerols) and the lowest ones for the oleate (5% of oleoyl-containing residual triacylglycerols) triacylglycerols, whereas the saturated triacylglycerols did not give TBHP adducts in readily detectable amounts. Normal-phase thin-layer chromatography along with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) with electrospray ionization was used to isolate and separate the major molecular species of polyunsaturated triacylglycerols and corresponding TBHP adducts. As an extreme example, the dilinoleoylmonooleoylglycerol was identified as the mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-TBHP adduct. LC/MS with electrospray ionization at elevated capillary exit voltage (pseudo tandem mass spectrometry) was used to confirm structures of the [M-RCOOH]+ ions and the absence of TBHP adducts of [M-RCOOH]+. It is concluded that stable adduct formation is an unavoidable complication of preparation of oxotriacylglycerols by oxidation with concentrated TBHP solutions and care must be taken to resolve the adducts from the desired oxidation product.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

It is used to introduce peroxy group into organic molecules, as a reagent in radical substitution reactions, and catalyst in polymerization reactions. HUMAN STUDIES: The main toxic effect of most peroxides is irritation of skin, mucous membranes and eyes. Prolonged or intense skin contact or splashes in the eyes may cause severe injury. Some organic peroxide vapors are irritating and may also cause headaches, intoxication similar to alcohol, and lung edema if inhaled in high concentrations. Some are skin sensitizers. Hydroperoxides are extremely irritating and corrosive to the eyes, with risk of blindness, and may cause serious injury or death if ingested in sufficient quantity. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide induced DNA lesions in human liver cells, and stimulated activity of superoxide dismutase and mainly glutathione peroxidase. A slight increase in the gene expression of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and catalase with 500 uM tert-butyl hydroperoxide and of catalase with 200 uM hydrogen peroxide was observed in HepG2 cells in culture. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in hepatoma cell line HepG2. ANIMAL STUDIES: When tested as a 75% solution in dimethylphthalate by application of two drops to rabbit eyes, it caused injury graded 5 on a scale of 0 to 7. A drop of 35% solution in propylene glycol caused a reaction graded between 46 and 79 on a scale of 0 to 100, persisting at least a week. A 7% solution in the same solvent was the maximum which could be tolerated without significant irritation. In a routine primary skin irritation assay, three out of six rabbits died. The peroxide is a severe dermal irritant. It can also be absorbed through the skin in toxic amounts to cause cyanosis, depression, loss of righting, blanching of the treated skin, convulsions, and death. In male rats serum hepatotoxicity parameters were increased from 2 hr following 1 mmol/kg tert-butyl hydroperoxide and reached their maximum values at 8 hr. In rats, injection of tert-butyl hydroperoxide into common bile-pancreatic duct induces acute necrotizing pancreatitis. In mice, tert-butyl hydroperoxide alters the miRNA expression profile of testis which might play a potential role in oxidative and antioxidative responses and spermatogenesis. In cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons tert-butyl hydroperoxide inhibited axonal transport via lipid peroxidation along with degenerative changes in organelles. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide was tested for the induction of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. It was positive at a dose of 2,000 ppm when administered to males by feeding in this assay. In vivo experiment showed no mutagenesis in the bone marrow cells after rats inhaled 100 ppm for 6 hr/day for 5 days. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: The effects of tert-butyl hydroperoxide on hepatic transcriptome expression patterns of the teleost fish Lithognathus mormyrus were studied. The effects were demonstrated by leukocyte infiltration into the liver and by differential expression of various genes, some already known to be involved in oxidative stress responses.",

Knowing that oxidative processes induced by t-BuOOH are triggered by (oxy)hemoglobin (Hb), the effect of different thiol drugs (RSH) on isolated human Hb oxidation to methemoglobin (MHb) and hemichromes (HChr) was further considered. Three types of chemiluminescence curves, fitting to logistic-exponential model, have been revealed under influence of RSH. Structure of the data (MHb and HChr production, and free radical activity of RSH) in Principal Component Analysis visualization and kinetic profiles of chemiluminescence integrate information in terms of the diversity of RSH reaction mechanisms depending on the specific molecular context of the given thiol: aliphatic or aromatic nature as well as the number and position of the -SH groups in the molecule. The study conducted in presented in vitro systems indicates the potential role of thiol drugs mediated toxicity in an oxidative stress dependent mechanism.",

The cells were exposed to tBHP (100 umol/L) after pretreatment with 6-shogaol (2.5 and 5 umol/L), and then cell viability was measured. 6-Shogaol fully prevented HepG2 cell death caused by tBHP. Treatment of tBHP resulted in apoptotic cell death as assessed by TUNEL assay and the expression of apoptosis regulator proteins, Bcl-2 family, caspases and cytochrome c. Cells treated with 6-shogaol showed rapid reduction of apoptosis by restoring these markers of apoptotic cells. In addition, 6-shogaol significantly recovered disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential as a start sign of hepatic apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. In line with this observation, antioxidative 6-shogaol inhibited generation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of reduced glutathione in tBHP-stimulated HepG2 cells. Taken together, these results for the first time showed antioxidative and antiapoptotic activities of 6-shogaol in tBHP-treated hepatoma HepG2 cells, suggesting that 6-shogaol could be beneficial in hepatic disorders caused by oxidative stress.",

The trolox-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles (trolox-CS NPs) were prepared by modifying chitosan with epoxyethane, which self-assembled into NPs and entrapped trolox, and then characterized by their size, size distribution, morphology and in vitro trolox release profile. Intracellular trafficking of CS NPs was observed. The anti-oxidant effect and potential mechanism of trolox-CS NPs were subsequently investigated in RAW264.7 cells. The effects of trolox-CS NPs on RAW264.7 cells damaged by tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP) were determined by MTT assay for cell viability, MDA assay for membrane lipid peroxidation, JC-1 probe and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining for mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) and RAW264.7 apoptosis, respectively. The trolox-CS NPs significantly improved cell viability and reduced MDA content compared with those of cells treated with free trolox. The trolox-CS NPs treatment inhibited MMP collapse and RAW264.7 apoptosis more obviously than free trolox. Molecular basis of apoptosis studied by western blotting revealed that trolox-CS NPs may block mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway through up-regulation of Bcl-2 and down-regulation of Bax and inhibiting the activation of pro-caspase 3, PARP and Bid.",

To understand better how these oxidants exert their effect on DNA and on the activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), we measured intracellular antioxidant glutathione (iGSH) and intracellular reactive oxidative species (iROS). DNA lesions corresponded to single-strand DNA breaks, alkali-labile lesions and formamido-pyrimidine-DNA-glycosylase (FPG)-sensitive sites. Pre-treatment of cells with carvacrol substantially decreased the number of H2O2-induced DNA lesions, but the number of t-BHP-induced DNA lesions was not reduced. Activities of both SOD and GPx were stimulated significantly by carvacrol and were reduced by the combined effect of carvacrol and oxidants. H2O2 and t-BHP alone influenced the level of antioxidant enzymes differently. While H2O2 did not markedly change the activity of SOD or GPx, lower concentrations of t-BHP stimulated activity of SOD and mainly GPx. The level of iROS was increased by both oxidants and decreased by carvacrol applied either alone or with oxidants. The level of iGSH was not influenced in any of the treatments tested. Our results show that although both oxidants induced oxidative stress and damaged cellular DNA, their influences on other molecular processes were different. The protective effect of carvacrol against DNA-damaging effects of H2O2 was unambiguous, but reduction by carvacrol of the DNA-damaging effect of t-BHP was not observed. These results suggest that the phenolic compound carvacrol contributes to the defense mechanisms of the human organism, but these beneficial effects are dependent on the origin and source of the actual oxidative stress.",

Since the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects of oxidative stress are largely unexplored, we aimed to investigate if the placental transport of glucose - the main energetic substrate for the fetus and placenta - is altered by oxidative stress. In a human syncytiotrophoblast (STB)cell model, the BeWo cell line,oxidative stress was induced by treatment with 100 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide(tert-BOOH) for 24 hr. Tert-BOOH decreased the steady-state intracellular accumulation (Amax) of[(3)H]2-deoxyglucose([(3)H]DG) mediated by both facilitative(GLUT) and non-facilitative(non-GLUT)glucose transporters. These effects were not associated with a change in the mRNA expression level of GLUT1, the major placental glucose transporter. Also,they seemed to be independent from phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase C signaling pathways and were unchanged either by inhibitors of free radical-generating enzymes or by free radical scavengers. In contrast, the dietary polyphenols quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate and resveratrol completely reversed the inhibitory effect of tert-BOOH upon[(3)H]DG accumulation through a specific effect on GLUT-mediated transport. Finally, tert-BOOH induced an increase in the transepithelial permeability to [(3)H]DG in the apical-to-basal direction, apparently related to an increase in its paracellular transport. In conclusion, tert-BOOH-induced oxidative stress reduces STB accumulation of glucose associated with an increase in its transepithelial permeability. This effect may contribute to the deleterious consequences of pregnancy disorders associated with oxidative stress.",

The cells were cultured in a medium (LS-medium) containing macro- and micro-elements. For the determination of cell growth, cells were exposed for 7 days in the LS-medium (test concentrations: 0-9-18-45-90-180 mg/L) after which the fresh weight of the cells was determined. For the determination of cell membrane integrity (determined by measuring continuously the conductivity of the medium that was pumped through a flow conductivity cell during a period of 12 hours), cells from the late exponential growth phase (usually 7-day old cultures) were collected, washed 3 times with \"electrical conductivity medium\" (EC medium, being a 1/100 dilution of the LS-medium), transferred to EC medium and exposed for 12 hours in this medium (test concentrations: 0-18-45-90-135-180 mg/L). Exposure to TBHP resulted in concentrations-related effects on both cell growth (decrease of fresh weight) and cell membrane integrity (increase of conductivity in the medium), with in both cases a LOEC of 45 mg/L (around 70% reduction of cell culture growth and around 50% increase in conductivity; percentages derived from graphs) and a NOEC of 18 mg/L. Maximum conductivity values after treatment with high concentrations of TBHP did not further increase after freeze-thaw treatment of the cultures and were in the same range as those measured after freeze-thawing of untreated cultures. Hence, according to the authors of this study, the observed increase in conductivity during TBHP treatment was due mainly to an efflux of ions caused by membrane damage rather than to a metabolic response of the cells to TBHP or to generation of ions by the reaction of TBHP with cellular components. In earlier in vitro tests with terrestrial plant tissues, viz. (discs) of egg plant fruit, white gourd, chayote fruit, radish root, potato tuber and red beet, exposure to TBHP in a growth solution also showed membrane damage, as indicated by the leakage of several cellular components, including potassium ions, reducing sugars and UV-absorbing materials. For example, these effects were found in tests with discs of turnip (Brassica rapa) and sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) exposed for 8-10 hours to a TBHP concentration of 900 mg/l; in these tests it was found that the leakage of cell components was accompanied by incorporation of TBHP, the formation of lipid hydroperoxides and a decrease in respiratory activity.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.46 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tert-butyl hydroperoxide will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase tert-butyl hydroperoxide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide will directly photolyze with breakage of the peroxide bond. If released to soil, tert-butyl hydroperoxide is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 86. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. The pKa of tert-butyl hydroperoxide is 12.8, indicating that this compound will exist in the un-ionized form in the environment. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks, indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. It is expected to react rapidly with organic matter in soil and water and be decomposed rapidly by metal ions, which will attenuate all transport processes. Hydroperoxides would be converted to the corresponding alcohols. If released into water, tert-butyl hydroperoxide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 20 days, respectively. However, hydroperoxides react with a variety of compounds and are reduced readily to the corresponding alcohols. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to tert-butyl hydroperoxide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tert-butyl hydroperoxide is produced or used. The general public is not likely to be exposed to tert-butyl hyroperxide. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 2 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 20 days(SRC). tert-Butyl hydroperoxide's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Tert-Butyl hydroperoxide is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 5.46 mm Hg(3). However, this compounds is expected to decompose rapidly in soil and water(4) which may attenuate the importance of volatilization to the atmosphere(SRC).",

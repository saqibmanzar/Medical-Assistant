Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, it has been suggested that tinidazole is metabolized and yields nitrite anions and metronidazole.

Toxicity is achieved via depletion of sulfhydryl groups and DNA strand breaks with multiple hits having an additive effect and ultimately leading to cell death.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.7X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tinidazole will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase tinidazole will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Tinidazole does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tinidazole is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 15. However, the estimated pKa of tinidazole is 4.7 (sp2 hybridized imidazole nitrogen), indicating that this compound will exist partially as a cation in the environment under acidic conditions and cations generally have lower mobility in soil than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because cations do not volatilize and based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.2X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Tinidazole is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available for tinidazole. If released into water, tinidazole is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. However, adsorption may be stronger than this Koc suggests since cations generally adsorb to sediments more strongly than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant and the fact that cations do not volatilize. An estimated BCF of <1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to tinidazole may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tinidazole is produced or used. Exposure to tinidazole among the general population may be limited to those administered this substance as a drug. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Patients must be removed from the exposure environment, and high-flow supplemental oxygen should be utilized. The respiratory system should be evaluated for injury, aspiration, or pulmonary edema and treated appropriately. CNS findings should be treated supportively. A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin and countershock may be effective. Cryogenic dermal injuries should be treated by water bath rewarming at 40 to 42 \u00b0C until vasodilatory flush has returned. Elevation of the limb and standard frostbite management with late surgical debridement should be utilized. Ocular exposure requires irrigation and slit-lamp evaluation for injury. /Freons/",

The same group of 12 dogs was used for trials at all exposure levels. The test material, a vapor at the experimental temperature and pressure, was released from a pressurized storage tank into the metered air supply to the facemasks, which was sampled and analyzed by thermal conductivity gas chromatograph every 5 minutes during exposures. Five minutes prior to the exposures, the dogs received a control intravenous injection of epinephrine (0.008 mg/kg), with an identical injection administered as challenge after the appropriate exposure interval. The exposures extended 5 minutes beyond the challenge injection for observation of subsequent recovery. Upon the challenge epinephrine injection, 1 dog each receiving 7.5 for 30 and 60 minutes, respectively, showed marked response (life-threatening arrhythmia) to treatment. One questionable and 1 definite marked response were also observed in 1 dog each in the 10% group after 30 minutes (there was no 60-minute, 10% exposure group). All marked responses were characterized by short bursts of multiple ventricular beats of up to 4 seconds in duration. One dog each responding seriously to 30-minute exposures to 7.5% and 10%, respectively, also exhibited atrial flutter. No response was noted after epinephrine challenge during a 5% exposure. The authors noted that only 1 dog of 12 showed more than one response in repeat experiments.",

Both anesthetized (2 monkeys and 2 baboons) and conscious primates inhaled from CBrF3/oxygen-filled bags of 300-400 L capacity supplied from pressurized steel cylinders, and exhaled to the outside atmosphere by means of a Pink valve or by endotracheal catheters (anesthetized animals). Cardiac function (ECG), arterial blood pressure and content, and cardiac output were monitored throughout the study. In the conscious animals, treatment was associated with evidence of cortical depression, including shivering, sedation, half-closed eyes, and lack of an inducible aggressive response. Intravenous injection of epinephrine (10 ug/kg bodyweight) induced a short sequence of ventricular fibrillation bursts from which all animals recovered spontaneously. Cardiac arrest could not be induced by further increasing the doses of epinephrine. Universal arrhythmias at 5-40 seconds after initiation of 20-80% exposures were intractable to the introduction of anesthesia. In monkeys, a 3-4 ug/kg bodyweight injection of epinephrine also elicited halved pressor responses during (but not after) 80% exposure. Similarly, during 80% exposures, no rise in blood pressure accompanied electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve (5 Hz, 10v, 2.5 msec). An identical stimulation regimen produced a 20 mm Hg elevation in blood pressure in untreated monkeys. Electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve in the arrhythmic monkeys of the 80% exposure group gave rise to incomplete or complete heart block of about 2-3 minute duration, which reverted spontaneously to bizarre arrhythmias dominated by ectopic beats. Arrhythmias were also noted to change without stimulation. Changes in heart rate occasionally heralded onset of arrhythmia during exposures to 20-80% CBrF3. Within the first minute of treatment, blood pressure rose slightly or was unchanged, and heart rates rose 10-15%. The authors attributed a 25% drop in mean blood pressure associated with ectopic beats and other ensuing treatment-related phenomena to an interference with the dynamic efficiency of the heart.",

However, the production of bromotrifluoromethane has to be stopped in accordance with the Montreal Protocol of 1987 as it plays an important role in the destruction of the earth's ozone layer. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.22X10+4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bromotrifluoromethane will exist solely in the gas phase in the ambient atmosphere. Gas-phase bromotrifluoromethane will be degraded slowly in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life of this reaction in air is estimated to be greater than 44 years. The primary decomposition process to occur in the stratosphere is UV photolysis. It has an estimated photolysis half-life of 72 yrs in the ambient atmosphere. If released to soil, bromotrifluoromethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 49. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.499 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, bromotrifluoromethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.2 hrs and 4.8 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 5.4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Based upon the high degree of stability, bromotrifluoromethane biodegradation is expected to be slow. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to bromotrifluoromethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bromotrifluoromethane is still or used. The general population may be exposed to bromotrifluoromethane via inhalation of ambient air and from fire extinguishing products containing bromotrifluoromethane. Bromotrifluoromethane is widely detected in the atmosphere due to its high stability. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.499 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.2 hrs and 4.8 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 5.4(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.86(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(SRC). Based upon the highly halogenated structure of bromotrifluoromethane, biodegradation is expected to be slow(9).",

Gas-phase bromotrifluoromethane is slowly degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life of this reaction in air is estimated to be greater than 44 years(3), calculated from it's rate constant of <1.0X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Bromotrifluoromethane has a maximum UV absorbance at 205 nm and does not appear to absorb UV light above 270 nm(4). It has an estimated photolysis lifetime in the atmosphere of 72 years(4). The primary decomposition process to occur in the stratosphere is UV photolysis(5). The stratospheric lifetime of bromotrifluoromethane has been estimated to range from 62 to 112 years(6). Therefore, when bromotrifluoromethane is released in the troposphere, it will diffuse gradually into the upper limits of the troposphere, and eventually, into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will degrade slowly via photolysis, contributing to ozone depletion(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

As assessed by plasma aminotranferase activities, nutmeg showed the most potent hepatoprotective activity. Bioassay-guided isolation of the active compound from nutmeg was carried out in mice by a single oral administration of the respective fractions. Myristicin, one of the major essential oils of nutmeg, was found to possess extraordinarily potent hepatoprotective activity. Myristicin markedly suppressed LPS/D-GalN-induced enhancement of serum TNF-alpha concentrations and hepatic DNA fragmentation in mice. These findings suggest that the hepatoprotective activity of myristicin might be, at least in part, due to the inhibition of TNF-alpha release from macrophages. ...",

Treatment of Hepa-1 cells with myristicin increased Cyp1a-1 transcription in a dose-dependent manner as shown by analysis of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity, Cyp1a-1 protein level, and Cyp1a-1 mRNA. Myristicin, however, did not competitively displace [3H]2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin from the Hepa-1 cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor in a competitive Ah receptor binding analysis using sucrose density gradient sedimentation and did not affect formation of DNA-protein complexes between the Ah receptor and its DRE target in a gel mobility shift assay using oligonucleotides corresponding to DRE 3 of the Cyp1a-1. ...",

Reduction of myristicin yielded dihydromyristicin that retained the GST-inducing activity. Myristicin and dihydromyristicin were tested for their capacity to inhibit benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)-induced tumor formation in female A/J mice. A 65% inhibition of the tumor multiplicity in the lung was observed as the result of treatment of myristicin. Dihydromyristicin produced small or insignificant reduction of lung tumor formation. In the forestomach, myristicin showed a 31% inhibition of tumor formation; while dihydromyristicin exhibited a 27% inhibition. Comparison of the structures and activities indicated that the saturation of the isolated double bond in myristicin resulted in a significant decrease in the inhibitory activity against B[a]P-induced tumorigenesis. The present results showed that myristicin, an active inducer of GST activity, is an effective inhibitor of B[a]P-induced tumorigenesis in mice. Stimulation of GST activity by myristicin could be a major mechanism for its inhibition of B[a]P or other carcinogens that may be detoxified in the same manner. ...",

These adducts were not detected in mice given tap water or one of 3 non-cola beverages. Adducts chromatographically identical to those induced by cola drinks were detected in mice treated with extracts of nutmeg or mace, spices from the nutmeg tree (Myristicia fragrans), or with myristicin, the major spice constituent of nutmeg. In addition, small amounts of adducts derived from the hepatocarcinogen safrole, a minor constituent of nutmeg, were observed. Liver DNA adducts were also detected in fetal liver when pregnant mice were intubated with myristicin. ...",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.5X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates myristicin will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase myristicin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours. If released to soil, myristicin is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 950. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. No biodegradation data were available for myristicin. If released into water, myristicin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 100 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to myristicin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where nutmeg, mace, carrots or frankfurters are processed or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to myristicin via ingestion of food. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

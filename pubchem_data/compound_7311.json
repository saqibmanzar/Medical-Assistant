ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In this study, we report the development and use of an EDA approach to identify endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in a multi-contaminated river sediment. The battery of in vitro reporter cell-based bioassays, measuring estrogenic, (anti)androgenic, dioxin-like, and pregnane X receptor (PXR)-like activities, revealed multi-contamination profiles. To isolate active compounds of a wide polarity range, we established a multi-step fractionation procedure combining: (1) a primary fractionation step using normal phase-based solid-phase extraction (SPE), validated with a mixture of 12 non-polar to polar standard EDCs; (2) a secondary fractionation using reversed-phase-based high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) calibrated with 33 standard EDCs; and (3) a purification step using a recombinant estrogen receptor (ER) affinity column. In vitro SPE and HPLC profiles revealed that ER and PXR activities were mainly due to polar to mid-polar compounds, while dioxin-like and anti-androgenic activities were in the less polar fractions. The overall procedure allowed final isolation and identification of new environmental PXR (e.g., di-iso-octylphthalate) and ER (e.g., 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-a-methoxy-p-cresol) ligands by using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry with full-scan mode acquisition in mid-polar fractions. In vitro biological activity of these chemicals was further confirmed using commercial standards, with di-iso-octylphthalate identified for the first time as a potent hPXR environmental agonist.",

Optimum conditions were found to be: 25 uL 1-bromohexadecane as extraction solvent, 5 mL of aqueous sample and 1 g of NaCl to control the ionic strength; manual shaking for 10 s; ultrasonication for 1 min; centrifugation for 3 min at 5000 rpm (speed). For MS-USAEME, manual shaking for 10 s is essential for effective extraction when the ultrasonic extraction time is as brief as 1 min. The small volume of aqueous sample enhances the effect of manual shaking significantly. For seawater samples, the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.5-2.8 ng/mL, the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 1.8-9.3 ng/mL with the relative standard deviation (RSD) in the range 4.2-10.3%. For detergent samples, the LOD was 0.4-2.4 ng/mL, LOQ was 1.6-8.2 ng/mL and RSD 4.7-10.0%. The relative recovery was 96-109% for seawater samples and 81-106% for the detergent samples.",

TTBP was determined by GC/MS (SIM) after extraction from food samples using a steam distillation technique. The developed method was able to determine simultaneously 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DTBP), 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (2,6-DTBP), 3,5-di-tert-butylphenol (3,5-DTBP) and 2,4-di-tert-pentylphenol (2,4-DTPP). The method was applied to analyze the residues of the 5 phenolic compounds in 101 food samples purchased from markets. TTBP was found in some samples of meat, liver and fish (muscle) at the levels of trace (tr)-0.50 ng/g, tr and tr-1.83 ng/g, respectively. 2,4-DTBP was found in some samples of vegetables, meat, liver, fish (muscle) and fish (viscera) at the levels of 1.4-10.6 ng/g, 2.7-26.4 ng/g, tr-34.2 ng/g, tr-21.6 ng/g and tr, respectively. 2,6-DTBP was found in some samples of fish (muscle) and fish (viscera) at the levels of tr-3.9 ng/g and tr, respectively. 3,5-DTBP and 2,4-DTPP were not found in any of the analyzed samples.",

Therefore, baby bottles made of alternative materials, e.g. polypropylene (PP) or polyethersulphone (PES), are currently marketed. The principal aim of the study was the identification of major compounds migrating from baby bottles using a liquid-liquid extraction followed by GC/MS analysis. A 50% EtOH in water solution was selected as a simulant for milk. After sterilization of the bottle, three migration experiments were performed during 2 hr at 70 \u00b0C. A non-targeted liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate-n-hexane (1:1) was performed on the simulant samples. Identification of migrants from 24 baby bottles was done using commercially available WILEY and NIST mass spectra libraries. Differences in the migrating compounds and their intensities were observed between the different types of plastics, but also between the same polymer from a different producer. Differences in the migration patterns were perceived as well between the sterilisation and the migrations and within the different migrations. Silicone, Tritan and PP exhibited a wide variety of migrating compounds, whereas PES and polyamide (PA) showed a lower amount of migrants, though sometimes in relatively large concentrations (azacyclotridecan-2-one up to 250 ug/kg). Alkanes (especially in PP bottles), phthalates (dibutylphthalate in one PP bottle (+/-40 ug/kg) and one silicone bottle (+/-25 ug/kg); diisobutylphthalate in one PP (+/-10 ug/kg), silicone (up to +/-80 ug/kg); and Tritan bottle (+/-30 ug/kg)), antioxidants (Irgafos 168, degradation products of Irganox 1010 and Irganox 1076), etc. were detected for PP, silicone and Tritan bottles. Although the concentrations were relatively low, some compounds not authorized by European Union Regulation No. 10/2011, such as 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (10-100 ug/kg) or 2-butoxyethyl acetate (about 300 ug/kg) were detected. Migrating chemicals were identified as confirmed (using a standard) or as tentative (further confirmation required).",

HUMAN STUDIES: Occupational vitiligo (cutaneous depigmentation) cases have been reported in workers who handled the rubber containing DTBP. Cytoxicity to multiple human cell lines have been reported. DTBP induces senescence in human gastric adenocarcinoma AGS cells as evidenced by upregulation of p21 and Rb and increased beta-galactosidase activity. DTBP also induces mitotic catastrophe and generates multinucleated cells, which is accompanied by an increase in the proportion of polymerized tubulin, possibly caused by inhibition of HDAC6 enzyme activity. ANIMAL STUDIES: A single 4 -hour, semi-occluded application of the test material to the intact skin of three rabbits produced well-defined erythema and very slight to slight edema. Other skin reactions noted were hemorrhage of the dermal capillaries, blanching, light brown discoloration of the epidermis, crust formation and hardened light brown-colored scabs. It was non-sensitizing to guinea pigs. The susceptibility of newborn rats to DTBP was found to be 4-5 times higher than that of young rats. The 1 -generation fertility / Repeated dose toxicity study was carried out in the rat. The parental generation rats were fed diets containing DTBP at dose levels of 50, 150 or 300 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks before mating and throughout mating, gestation and lactation. Groups of 20 generation F1 progeny of each sex were maintained on the experimental diets for 13 weeks after weaning. Reproductive capability of the parental generation animals was unimpaired by the ingestion of DTBP at dose levels of up to 300 mg/kg/d. Ingestion of 300 mg DTBP/kg/d elicited a significant reduction in the mean number of progeny born and reduced the growth rate of the F1 progeny during lactation. The former effect was not apparent at dose levels of 50 and 150 mg/kg/d. The reduced growth rate was also apparent in the progeny of animals treated at 150 mg/kg/d and was associated with a higher average litter number. There were no substance related deaths in any of the experimental groups during the feeding phase. Dietary administration of DTBP at a dose level of 300 mg/kg daily for 13 weeks to rats elicited a primary toxic effect on growth rate, and at dose level of 150 mg/kg/d, elicited growth retardation which was secondary to reduced diet palatability. DTBP was not clastogenic in vivo.",

Compounds 1-3 exhibited antioxidant activities on copper-mediated (1: IC50=2.6 microM, 2: IC50=8.2 microM, 3: IC50=63.0 microM), AAPH-mediated oxidation (1: IC50=3.9 microM, 2: IC50=9.9 microM, 3: IC50=71.8 microM), and SIN-1-mediated oxidation (1: 70%, 2: 52%, 3: 29% at 5.0 microM) in the TBARS assay. The antioxidant activities of compounds 1-3 were tested with respect to other parameters, such as the lag time of conjugated diene fromation, relative electrophoretic mobility (REM) of ox-LDL, and apoB-100 fragmentation on copper-mediated LDL-oxidation. In addition, compounds 1-3 showed 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrasyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and compound 1 also exhibited metal chelating activity.",

The interiors of these pumps were injection-molded with rubber. We identified a small but significant cluster of vitiligo cases among a group of employees who frequently handled the rubber used in this injection molding process. Although none of the additives specified in the rubber formulations was a phenolic or catecholic derivative, known to be potential causes of chemically induced vitiligo, gas chromatographic analysis identified a para-substituted phenol (2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, DTBP) in solid samples of the most frequently used rubber. Surface wipe analysis confirmed that workers could be exposed to DTBP from simple handling of the rubber. We subsequently established that the solid bulk rubber used as the base in these stock rubber formulations contained both DTBP and smaller quantities of p-tert-butylphenol. Both had formed as unsuspected byproducts during chemical synthesis of two antioxidants added to the solid bulk rubber by a major rubber supplier. We conclude that the unsuspected presence of potential chemical depigmenting agents in solid bulk rubber, from which industrial rubber products are formulated, may contribute to the occurrence of occupational vitiligo, and that a simple review of ingredients in rubber formulations is inadequate to detect their presence.",

However, the cytotoxic activity of these compounds has not yet been established. TBP produced phenoxyl radicals at pH >/= 9.0 and 2,4-di-t-butylphenol (DBP) at pH 12.5, but 3,3',5,5'-tetra-t-butyl-1,1'-biphenyl-2,2'-diol (bisDBP) did not, using ESR spectroscopy. Both superoxide anion radical (O(2)(-)) scavenging activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production activity declined in the order of TBP > DBP > bisDBP. The cytotoxic activity against human oral tumor cell lines (HSC-2, HSG) and human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF) declined in the order of DBP >> bisDBP = TBP = TBP-OOH (2,4,6-tri-t-butyl-4-hydroperoxy-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-one). The cytotoxic activity of TBP, but not of DBP or bisDBP was significantly enhanced after visible light (VL)-irradiation for 10 min. The cytotoxicity of irradiated TBP was significantly higher than that of either original TBP or TBP-OOH, the oxidative metabolite of TBP, possibly due to the formation of TBP stable radical and ROS via oxidation. In contrast, the cytotoxic activity of DBP and bisDBP was independent of radical production, and therefore, may be intrinsic. A non-enzymatic oxidation decomposition of DBP or TBP was estimated from the formation of reaction enthalpy (DeltaH) using a modified neglect of diatomic overlap, parametric method 3 (MNDO-PM3) semi-empirical method, suggesting that O(2) is capable of activating DBP to a reactive quinone or dimer and that TBP phenoxyl radicals via oxidation directly affect extra- or intracellular bioactive materials, resulting in the induction of cytotoxicity.",

Here, we found that DTBP induces senescence in human gastric adenocarcinoma AGS cells as evidenced by upregulation of p21 and Rb and increased beta-galactosidase activity. DTBP also induces mitotic catastrophe and generates multinucleated cells, which is accompanied by an increase in the proportion of polymerized tubulin, possibly caused by inhibition of HDAC6 enzyme activity. In silico docking analysis showed that DTBP docked at the entrance of the ligand-binding pocket of the HDAC6 enzyme. Accordingly, DTBP represents a promising lead structure for the development of HDAC6 inhibitors, with an improvement in specificity conferred by modification of the cap group. We propose for the first time that the underlying mechanism of the anticancer activity of DTBP is attributed to inhibition of HDAC6 activity.",

Fungicidal activity was demonstrated against Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium chrysogenum by disc diffusion assay. Among the cell lines tested for cytotoxicity of this compound (normal cell line H9c2 and cancer cell lines HeLa and MCF-7), a remarkable cytotoxicity against HeLa cells with an IC50 value of 10 ug/mL was shown. A biocontrol experiment with 2,4 DTBP supplemented fraction prevented growth of the above mentioned fungi on wheat grains. The study further strengthens the case for development of biopreservatives and dietary antioxidants from lactic acid bacteria for food applications.",

In the newborn rats, specific effects on physical and sexual development and reflex ontogeny were not observed. While there were no clear differences in toxicological profiles between newborn and young rats, the no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) differed markedly. For 2TBP, clinical signs such as ataxic gait, decrease in locomotor activity and effects on liver, such as increase in organ weight, were observed and the NOAELs were concluded to be 20 and 100 mg/kg/day in newborn and young rats, respectively. Based on hepatic and renal toxicity (histopathological changes and increase in organ weight with blood biochemical changes), the respective NOAELs for DTBP were concluded to be 5 and 20 mg/kg/day. Therefore, the susceptibility of newborn rats to 2TBP and DTBP was found to be 4-5 times higher than that of young rats.",

F1 progeny was exposed to the test article through gestation and lactation and for 13 weeks after weaning. In addition, the nature of the treatment-related changes observed during the 13 week treatment period were investigated during a subsequent 4 week treatment-free period for some of the animals. The parental generation rats were fed diets containing 2,4-di-tert-butyl-phenol (DTBP) at dose levels of 50, 150 or 300 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks before mating and throughout mating, gestation and lactation. Groups of 20 generation F1 progeny of each sex were maintained on the experimental diets for 13 weeks after weaning. Similar groups of animals fed untreated powdered diet for similar periods acted as control group. Five male and 5 female animals from each of the groups were maintained untreated for 4 weeks after the 13 week feeding phase, to investigate the nature of any treatment-related changes observed.  Reproductive capability of the parental generation animals was unimpaired by the ingestion of DTBP at dose levels of up to 300 mg/kg/d. Ingestion of 300 mg DTBP/kg/d elicited a significant reduction in the mean number of progeny born and reduced the growth rate of the F1 progeny during lactation. The former effect was not apparent at dose levels of 50 and 150 mg/kg/d. The reduced growth rate was also apparent in the progeny of animals treated at 150 mg/kg/d and was associated with a higher average litter number. There were no substance related deaths in any of the experimental groups during the feeding phase. Daily observations of these animals did not reveal any overt signs of toxicity attributable to the ingestion of DTBP. From the onset of treatment of the animals selected for further study, there was a dose-dependent reduction in the food consumption and body weight gain at all dose levels of DTBP employed. The effect in the females was less marked than in the males. At dose levels of 50 and 150 mg/kg/d the severity of the effect on food consumption was of a similar magnitude to that of the effect on body weight, and probably indicated reduced diet palatability. However, at the highest dose level employed (300 mg/kg/d) the retardation of body weight gain was disproportionally high in relation to the effect on food consumption and therefore considered a primary toxic effect. The water consumption of DTBP-treated groups of animals was generally lower than that of the controls during the 13 week feeding phase. No ocular defects were observed in the animals treated with DTBP at 300 mg/kg/d which could be related to the ingestion of the test article. A low incidence of defects was observed in the control and dose level 300 mg/kg/d animals. Ocular lesions observed included intravitreal hemorrhage, lenticular opacity and fibrous corneal adhesions. The nature of the lesions suggested that they were traumatic lesions resulting from the retro-orbital sinus puncture procedure for blood sampling. At the start of the feeding phase, animals treated with 300 mg/kg DTBP showed reduced hemoglobin, packed cell volume, mean cell volume and white blood cell counts. These effects were considered to reflect the degree of growth retardation observed during the lactation period. Investigation of the blood chemistry and urine constituents in animals treated at 300 mg/kg/d did not reveal any consistent evidence of an effect of DTBP ingestion. The relative liver weight of male and female animals at 300 mg/kg/d was significantly higher than that of the controls. A similar but less marked effect was also apparent in female animals treated at 150 mg/kg/d. After 4 weeks without DTBP ingestion, relative liver weights had returned to normal values in animals treated at 300 mg/kg/d. These observations are indicative of a physiological (adaptive) response to the ingestion of DTBP. This is confirmed by the lack of any microscopic changes in the liver. The relative weight of the kidney of males treated at 150 and 300 mg/kg/d, and the relative spleen weight of males treated at 300 mg/kg/d were increased. The biological significance of these observations is questionable in the absence of microscopic changes. Post-mortem and microscopic examination of the tissues and organs of the animals treated with DTBP at 300 mg/kg/d for 13 weeks did not reveal any gross or microscopic lesions which could be attributed to the ingestion of DTBP. Dietary administration of DTBP at a dose level of 300 mg/kg daily for 13 weeks to rats elicited a primary toxic effect on growth rate, and at dose level of 150 mg/kg/d, elicited growth retardation which was secondary to reduced diet palatability. With the exception of adaptive, hepatic changes and palatability effects, the \"no adverse effect\" level established in this study was 150 mg DTBP/kg/d, which is considered a no adverse effect level.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.77X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hrs. 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 9000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.6 and 16 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. A BCF range of 128-360 of 740 suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol via house dust, water distribution systems using plastic pipes and use of electronic consumer products containing this compound.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 4.77X10-3 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 35 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.6 and 16 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 120 months if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), a BCF range of 128-436(5) suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks(5) indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Urban dust showed significantly higher ?SPA levels (range: 1.56e3 - 2.03e4 ng/g) compared with those in rural indoor dust (668-4.39e3 ng/g, p < 0.05). 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) was the dominate analogue in the urban indoor dust, which constituted of 74% in SSPAs. While, varied composition profiles of SPAs were noticed in rural indoor dust, for instance, AO 246 (46%) and BHT (43%) had similar contributions to ?SPAs. Three BHT transformation products (TPs) were also detected in most of the urban and rural dust samples (>97%), with individual residue level in the same order: 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (BHT-Q) > 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy- 4-methyl-2,5-cyclo-hexadienone (BHT-quinol) > 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzal-dehyde (BHT-CHO). Geometric mean values of total TP concentrations were 555 ng/g and 131 ng/g for urban and rural indoor dust samples, respectively. A preliminary estimated daily intake calculation at dust ingestion scenario suggested additional concerns might be paid to simultaneous exposure of several SPA analogues and TPs besides current focus on BHT exposure risks.",

Most studies focus on the odor problems these substances may cause. This study investigates the potential endocrine disrupting effects of the migrating compound 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-d-t-BP). The summarized results show that the migration of 2,4-d-t-BP from plastic pipes could result in chronic exposure and the migration levels varied greatly among different plastic pipe materials and manufacturing brands. Based on estrogen equivalent (EEQ), the migrating levels of the leachable compound 2,4-d-t-BP in most plastic pipes were relative low. However, the EEQ levels in drinking water migrating from four out of 15 pipes may pose significant adverse effects. With the increasingly strict requirements on regulation of drinking water quality, these results indicate that some drinking water transported with plastic pipes may not be safe for human consumption due to the occurrence of 2,4-d-t-BP. Moreover, 2,4-d-t-BP is not the only plastic pipe-migrating estrogenic compound, other compounds such as 2-tert-butylphenol (2-t-BP), 4-tert-butylphenol (4-t-BP), and others may also be leachable from plastic pipes.",

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles are typically used as water containers for SODIS, but a new SODIS container design has recently been developed with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags and can overcome the drawbacks of PET bottles. Two nesting layers of LDPE bags are used in the new design: the inner layer containing the water to be disinfected and the outer one creating air insulation to minimize heat loss from the water to the surroundings. This work investigated the degradation of LDPE bags used in the new design in actual SODIS conditions over a period of 12 weeks. The degradation of the LDPE bags was investigated weekly using a scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer, and tensile strength tester. It was found that the LDPE bags gradually degraded under the sunlight due to photo-oxidation reactions, especially in the outer bags, which were directly exposed to the sun and surroundings, leading to the reduction of light transmittance (by 11% at 300 nm) and tensile strength (by 33%). In addition, possible leaching of organic compounds into the water contained in the inner bags was examined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol was found in some SODIS water samples as well as the as-received water samples, in the concentration range of 1-4 ug/L, which passes the Environmental Protection Agency Drinking Water Guidance on Disinfection By-Products.",

Plastics are widely used, e.g. as casings of consumer electronics (TVs, computers, routers, etc.), which are present in houses and offices in continuously increasing numbers. In this study, we investigate the estrogenic activity of components of plastics coming from electronics' casings. A recently developed fractionation platform for effect-directed analysis (EDA) was used. This platform combines reversed-phase liquid chromatography in parallel with bioassay detection via nanofractionation and with online high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) for the identification of bioactives. Four out of eight of the analyzed plastics samples showed the presence of estrogenic compounds. Based on the MS results these were assigned to bisphenol A (BPA), 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, and a possible bisphenol A analog. All samples contained flame retardants, but these did not show any estrogenicity. The observed BPA, however, could be an impurity of tetrabromo-BPA (TBBPA) or TBBPA-based flame retardants. Due to the plausible migration of additives from plastics into the environment, plastics from consumer electronics likely constitute a source of estrogenic compound contamination in the indoor environment.",

OBJECTIVES:  We aimed to profile exposure to multiple environmental organic acids (EOAs) and identify novel chemicals that have not been previously biomonitored in a diverse population of pregnant women.  METHODS:  We used liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) to perform a suspect screen for 696 EOAs, (e.g., phenols and phthalate metabolites) on the maternal serum collected at delivery from 75 pregnant women delivering at two large San Francisco Hospitals. We examined demographic differences in peak areas and detection frequency (DF) of suspect EOAs using a Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test or Fisher's exact test. We confirmed selected suspects by comparison with their respective reference standards.  RESULTS:  We detected, on average, 56 [standard deviation (SD)]: 8) suspect EOAs in each sample (range: 32-73). Twelve suspect EOAs with DF=60 were matched to 21 candidate compounds in our EOA database, two-thirds of which are novel chemicals. We found demographic differences in DF for 13 suspect EOAs and confirmed the presence of 6 priority novel chemicals: 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol, Pyrocatechol, 2,4-Dinitrophenol, 3,5-Di-tert-butylsalicylic acid, 4-Hydroxycoumarin, and 2'-Hydroxyacetophenone (or 3'-Hydroxyacetophenone). The first two are high-production-volume chemicals in the United States.  CONCLUSION:  Suspect screening in human biomonitoring provides a viable method to characterize a broad spectrum of environmental chemicals to prioritize for targeted method development and quantification.",

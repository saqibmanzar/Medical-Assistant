Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid and kill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment. (L795)",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

NaOH (or Na2CO3) /sodium carbonate/ can also be added to the mixture to help speed the reactions when calcium oxide is used as the main alkali. The amt of calcium oxide or NaOH to use depends on the amt of pesticide to be disposed of and, to some extent, the concentration of active ingredient in the pesticide and the actual chemical nature of the active ingredient. A practical guideline, in the absence of specific directions, is to use an approx volume or weight of alkali from one-half of to the same as that of the pesticide. For dilute formulations, such as a 1% soln or dust, the amount of calcium oxide of NaOH can be reduced by one-half. For very concentrated pesticides (over 80% active ingredient) the amount of calcium oxide or NaOH can be doubled, but the concentrate should be mixed first with water (or soapy water) before reaction with the alkali. For safety, a preliminary test should be made in which very small amt of the pesticide and alkali are mixed and observed briefly to make sure it does not react too vigorously. Sizable quantities of pesticides can be disposed of in several smaller batches, rather than all at once, for added safety. Recommendable method: Incineration. Peer-review: Large amt should be incinerated in a unit with effluent gas scrubbing when well diluted with other wastes. (Peer-review conclusions of an IRPTC expert consultation (May 1985))",

Carbamates form unstable complexes with chlolinesterases by carbamoylation of the active sites of the enzymes.  This inhibition is reversible. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholine esterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholine esterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses.  Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Chronically high (>10 years) exposure leads to neuropsychological consequences including disturbances in perception and visuo-motor processing (A15321).",

For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

Rapid degradation of (14)C-labeled mexacarbate has been observed in sandy loam and clay loam forest soil litters. The half-lives for (14)CO2 evolution in the sand loam and clay loam litters ranged were 7.31 and 8.88 days, respectively, under aerobic conditions and 7.72 and 9.32, respectively, under submerged conditions. Mexacarbate may biodegrade in soil and may photolyze at the soil surface. Volatilization of mexacarbate from near-surface soils is not expected to be an important removal process. If released to water, mexacarbate is expected to hydrolyze to a variety of products. The half-lives for hydrolysis of mexacarbate in bufferred solutions at 20 \u00b0C and pH 5.94, 7.0, and 8.42 were 46.5, 25.7, and 4.6 days, respectively. Photolysis and biodegradation may also occur. Bioconcentration, adsorption to sediments, and volatilization are not expected to be significant. In the atmosphere, vapor phase mexacarbate will react with photochemically generated hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of 7.9 hours. Human exposure to mexacarbate most likely results from use of the pesticide on lawns, turfs, and flowers. (SRC)",

The river receives domestic and industrial wastes and farm runoff. After one week, 85% of the initial amount of mexacarbate had degraded. All the initial mexacarbate had degraded after 2 weeks(1). Mexacarbate hydrolyzes, especially under alkaline conditions, to yield a variety of products. The half-lives for hydrolysis of mexacarbate in buffered solutions at 20 \u00b0C adn pH 5.94, 7.0, and 8.42 were 46.5, 25.7, and 4.6 days respectively(2). Volatilization is not expected to be significant but biodegradation may occur. Photolysis may occur near the water surface. Bioconcentration will not be significant and mexacarbate is not expected to strongly adsorb to sediments(SRC).",

Average droplet density (drops/sq cm) and ground deposition (g/ha) between the 2 applications differed considerably. The values for the first and second applications were respectively 1.7 and 0.73 and 5.2 and 2.0. But the average NMD (Number Median Diameter) 20 mum and VMD (Volume Median Diameter) 36 mum values for both applications were nearly the same. The maximum 1 hr post spray concentrations of mexacarbate in the stream and pond waters were respectively 0.73 ppb and 18.74 ppb. Concentrations fell rapidly to below detection limits within 12 hr in stream and within 3 days in pond water. Cattails (Typha latifolia), manna grass (Glyceria borealis) and bog moss (Sphagnum sp) collected from the pond contained peak 1 hr post-spray concentrations of 720 ppb, 482 ppb, and 81 ppb, respectively. The concentration levels decreased rapidly and the average half-lives of the chemical in them were about 3.9, 8.5, and 2.0 hr. Bog moss, stream moss (Fontinalis sp), watercress (Nasturtium officinalis), buttercup (Ranunculus aquatilis) and green algae (Draparnaldia sp) sampled from the stream sites did not contain measurable levels of mexacarbate. Also, caged and wild tadpoles (Rana clamitans melanota) from the pond, brook trout (Salvenilus fontinalis) (caged and wild), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) (wild) and mayfly nymphs (Ephemerella sp) collected from the stream did not contain any of the material. Mexacarbate was not detected in stream and pond sediments. The demethylated products, 4-methylamino and 4-amino-3,5-xylyl methylcarbamate and the phenol, 4-dimethylamino-3,5-xylenol as transformation products were frequently detected in water and in the aquatic plants which had accumulated the insecticide. The presence of these compounds showed that demethylation and hydrolytic routes are the major metabolic pathways for the dissipation of mexacarbate from these substrates.",

No information on the rate of disappearance of mexacarbate was presented, but the formation of 2-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone required less than one hour at pH values of 9 and greater and several days at pH values of 4.5 or lower. The maximum rate of 2-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone formation occurred at pH 9.5. The rate was the same in the light as in the dark(1). Exposure of an ethanol solution of mexacarbate to sunlight for 1-3 hours yielded a variety of unidentified photolytic products, but no rate data were presented(2). The half-life for the reaction of vapor phase mexacarbate in the atmosphere with photochemically generated hydroxyl radicals was estimated to be 7.90 hours(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

All mortality occurred from 4 hours to 24 hours post-gavage and was consistent with an oral LD50 of 1.5 g/kg. During 14-day post-gavage observation, clinical signs of toxicity included clonic convulsions (1.5, 3.0 g/kg) and weight loss in 1 and 3 rats, respectively, dying by Day 1 of 3.0 and 1.5 g/kg groups; all surviving rats, including 5/10 mid-dose rats, gained weight. Among the solitary rats of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 4.0 gavaged doses in the range-finding study, pharmacotoxic signs observed during 14-day recovery included tremors, tachypnea, clonic convulsions, dyspnea, fasciculation, and hyperactivity. All lethalities in the range-finding study demonstrated distinct lesions upon necropsy with enlarged mandibular lymph nodes, pale renal medullae and spleen, blood accumulations in the brain, and mottled lungs.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diphenyl carbonate will exist solely as a vapor. Vapor-phase diphenyl carbonate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 96 hours. Diphenyl carbonate may also undergo direct photolysis in the environment since this compound contains a functional group that can absorb light greater than 290 nm. If released to soil, diphenyl carbonate is expected to be slightly mobile based upon an estimated Koc of 3,900. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.5X10-5 atm-cu m/mole; however, this process is expected to be attenuated by adsorption. If released into water, diphenyl carbonate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 days and 12 hours, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 126 days if adsorption is considered. Diphenyl carbonate is expected to undergo hydrolysis due to the presence of hydrolyzable functional groups. An estimated BCF of 67 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to diphenyl carbonate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.5X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 hours and 10 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 126 days if adsorption is considered(8). Diphenyl carbonate is expected to undergo hydrolysis due to the presence of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 67(SRC), from its log Kow of 3.28(7) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

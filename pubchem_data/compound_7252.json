When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The gel was applied to the abdominal skin of dogs for 3 hours (the number of dogs was not specified). The amount of toluene-2,5-diamine absorbed into the blood was determined using the Schiff base method. During the 3-hour exposure, the concentration of toluene-2,5-diamine increased to 1 mg/mL of blood. The concentration increased more rapidly during the later stage of the experiment than during the earlier stage. After the gel was removed and the area washed, the concentration in the blood decreased slowly. To determine the amount of toluene-2,5-diamine that had been absorbed through the skin, the absorption was imitated by a continuous intravenous infusion of toluene-2,5-diamine. An infusion of 0.022 mg of toluene-2,5-diamine per kilogram per minute was administered for 3 hours. During the first 2 hours, the concentration in the blood was greater than that seen in the absorption experiments; after 3 hours of infusion, the concentrations were the same. Because each dog weighed approximately 10 kg, it was calculated that 40 mg of toluene-2,5-diamine had been infused over the 3-hour period. Thus, it was assumed that the same amount was absorbed through the skin of the dogs in 3 hours.",

After a 3-hour cutaneous exposure to a gel containing 3% hydrogen peroxide and 1.4 mg of toluene-2,5-diamine, no toluene-2,5-diamine was detected in the blood of dogs. An intravenous infusion of 0.0015 mg of toluene-2,5-diamine per kilogram of body weight per minute for 3 hours produced a detectable concentration of toluene-2,5-diamine. Thus, the absorption through the skin was less than 3 mg. Absorption of toluene-2,5-diamine was proved by the detection of small amounts (60-70 mg) in the urine.",

Three women and 3 men were injected with 2.6 mL of a solution containing 5.54 mg of toluene-2,5-diamine. The rate of excretion was highest during the first few hours after the injection. An average of 4.5 mg of N,N'-dpt, or more specifically, 2.64 mg of toluene-2,5-diamine, was isolated from the urine; thus, 47.6% of the injected dose was excreted as N,N'-dpt. The authors calculated that 4.6 mg of toluene-2,5-diamine was either absorbed during the dyeing process or liberated in vivo from a compound formed during the preparation of the hair dye and absorbed through the skin.",

The eye was not rinsed, and was evaluated and scored according to the Draize scoring system at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hr after application and then daily until Day 8. The test substance induced marked conjunctival irritation with chemosis and redness, slight iridial irritation and moderate to slight corneal opacity. All of these effects were reversible within 7-8 days. Under the test conditions, in which the test substance was applied undiluted and was not rinsed from the eye, the test substance was irritating to the rabbit eye. The high pH of the test solution may have contributed to the observed irritation."

The high and low time-weighted average concentrations of the compound were, respectively, 0.2 and 0.06% for rats and 0.1 and 0.6% for mice. Because compound administration to the high and low dose groups of each species was not begun simultaneously, each dosed group was assigned a control group. All control groups consisted of 50 animals, except for the high dose male and female rat control groups which were composed of 25 animals.

Results were not statistically calculated, but were based on the sensitivity of the positive control (benzo(a)pyrene). 2,5-Toluene diamine was tested at concentrations of 0.63, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0 or 10ug/ml, with relative cell survival ranging from 100% to 0%. Under highly sensitive conditions (positive control highly active), at least one transformed foci was observed at the two highest treatments. A second experiment tested at concentrations of 1.0, 1.5, 2.2, 3.3 or 5.0ug/ml, resulted in a range of 95% to 25% relative survival. Under less sensitive conditions (positive control weakly active), none of the treatments produced transformed foci. 2,5-Toluene diamine was considered to be weakly active in the cell transformation assay.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.4X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-methyl-1,4-benzenediamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-methyl-1,4-benzenediamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.6 hours. By analogy to toluene-2,4-diamine which absorbs light at wavelengths >294 nm, 2-methyl-1,4-benzenediamine may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-methyl-1,4-benzenediamine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 53. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.4X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Methyl-1,4-benzenediamine may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradadtion data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, 2-methyl-1,4-benzenediamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2-methyl-1,4-benzenediamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-methyl-1,4-benzenediamine is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-methyl-1,4-benzenediamine via dermal contact with consumer products containing 2-methyl-1,4-benzenediamine. (SRC)",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 0.6 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 2-Methyl-1,4-benzenediamine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

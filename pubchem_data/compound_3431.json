PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Thus, the previously established group PMTDI of 2 \u00b5g/kg bw for FB1, FB2 and FB3, alone or in combination, was retained by the current Committee. The Committee noted that the international exposure estimates for FB1 and total fumonisins were lower than those estimated by the Committee at its seventy-fourth meeting in 2011. In the current assessment, a larger part of the occurrence data was from countries belonging to the WHO European Region compared with 2011, resulting in lower overall fumonisin levels in maize. In the current assessment, no information on fumonisin levels in maize was available from countries belonging to the African, Eastern Mediterranean or South-East Asia regions, where higher fumonisin concentrations are typically detected. Given these limitations of the occurrence data used in the exposure assessment and high exposures reported in the literature in some countries, it is likely that the exposures to fumonisins in areas where maize is a staple food and high contamination with fumonisins can occur are higher than those estimated by the Committee at this meeting, as can be seen in the previous evaluation, which was based on a larger and more representative data set. At the eighty-third meeting the Committee also evaluated co-exposure to aflatoxins and fumonisins. Fumonisins and aflatoxins are both frequent contaminants in cereals and cerealbased foods. Aflatoxins are common contaminants in groundnuts and tree nuts. Co-exposure to both mycotoxins is likely in areas where these foods are regularly consumed. Although evidence in laboratory animals from the previous and the present evaluations has suggested an additive or synergistic effect of fumonisin and aflatoxin co-exposure in the development of preneoplastic lesions or hepatocellular carcinoma, currently no data are available on such effects in humans. The Committee concluded that there are few data available to support co-exposure as a contributing factor in human disease. However, the interaction between AFB1, a compound with known genotoxic properties, and fumonisins, which have the potential to induce regenerative cell proliferation (particularly at exposures above the PMTDI), remains a concern. This is due to the fact that the incidences of chronic liver disease and stunting are high in the areas of the world where the exposures to both mycotoxins are high and the co-exposure has been confirmed with biomarkers.",

The extracts were cleaned-up on a reversed-phase (C18)     solid-phase extraction cartridge, and FB1 was determined by o-phthaldialdehyde derivatization     and reversed-phase HPLC. The analytical method for the determination of FB1 in the fecal     extracts was reproducible [2.6% relative standard deviation (RSD)] and accurate (recovery from  spiked blank extracts of 93 +/- 2.9% RSD). Confirmation of the identification of FB1 in faeces  was achieved using HPLC and thin-layer chromatography, which showed that the radioactivity  extracted corresponded mainly to FB1 and a new metabolite with chromatographic properties  similar to those of the mycotoxin. The new metabolite was identified by mass spectrometry and  nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be an equilibrium mixture of the two structural  isomers of partially hydrolysed FB1, which are formed by hydrolysis of one of the ester groups  of the mycotoxin.",

In eucaryotic cells, fumonisin inhibition of  sphingolipid biosynthesis is a result of inhibition of the enzyme ceramide synthase. Large  increase in free sphinganine concentration in plant and animal cells are observed within a few  hours after exposure to fumonisins and/or Alternaria toxins (AAL-toxins). Some of the  sphinganine is metabolized to other bioactive intermediates, and some is released from cells.  In animals, free sphinganine accumulates in tissues and quickly appears in blood and urine.  Free sphingoid bases are toxic to most cells, and complex sphingolipids are essential for  normal cell growth. Fumonisin B1 stimulates sphinganine-dependent DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3  cells, but is mitoinhibitory in other cell types. In cultured cells the accumulation of  bioactive long-chain sphingoid bases and depletion of complex sphingolipids are clearly  contributing factors in growth inhibition, increased cell death, and (in Swiss 3T3 cells)  mitogenicity of fumonisins. While disruption of sphingolipid metabolism directly affects  cells, it may indirectly affect some tissues. For example, fumonisin B1 impairs the barrier  function of endothelial cells in vitro. Adverse effects on endothelial cells could indirectly  contribute to the neurotoxicity and pulmonary edema caused by fumonisins. It is hypothesized  that fumonisin-induced changes in the sphingolipid composition of target tissues could  directly or indirectly contribute to all Fusarium moniliforme-associated diseases.",

Removal of the tricarballylic acids from fumonisin B1 reduces the potency by at least 10 fold;  and fumonisin A1 (which is acetylated on the amino group) is essentially inactive. Studies  with diverse types of cells (hepatocytes, neurons, kidney cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and  plant cells) have established that fumonisin B1 not only blocks the biosynthesis of complex  sphingolipids; but also, causes sphinganine to accumulate. Some of the sphinganine is  metabolized to the 1-phosphate and degraded to hexadecanal and ethanolamine phosphate, which  is incorporated into phosphatidylethanolamine. Sphinganine is also released from cells and,  because it appears in blood and urine, can be used as a biomarker for exposure. The  accumulation of these bioactive compounds, as well as the depletion of complex sphingolipids,  may account for the toxicity, and perhaps the carcinogenicity, of fumonisins.",

Epidemiological   studies associate FB1 with human sophageal cancer in China and South   Africa. FB1 also causes   acute pulmonary edema in pigs and equine leucoencephalomalacia. This   disease is thought to be   a consequence of inhibition by FB1 of cellular ceramide synthesis   in cells. To investigate   further on this pathogenesis, the effect of FB1 was studied on cell   viability (3 to 54 uM of   FB1), protein (2.5 to 20 uM of FB1) and DNA syntheses (2.5 to 50  uM  of FB1), and cellular   cycle (3 to 18 uM of FB1) of rat C6 glioma cells after 24 hr   incubation. The results of the   viability test show that FB1 induces 10  2% and 47  4% cell   death with, respectively, 3 and   54 uM, in C6 cells. This cytotoxicity induced by FB1 was   efficiently prevented when the cells   were preincubated 24 hr with vitamin E (25 uM). FB1   displays epigenetic properties since it   induced hypermethylation of the DNA (9-18 uM).   Inhibition of protein synthesis was observed   with FB1 with an IC50 of 6 M showing that C6   glioma cells are very sensitive to FB1; however,   the synthesis of DNA was only slightly   inhibited, up to 20 uM of FB1. The flow cytometry   showed that the number of cells in phase S   decreased significantly as compared to the control   p = 0.01 from 18.7  2.5% to 8.1  1.1%  for  9 uM FB1. The number of cells in phase G2/uM   increased significantly as compared to the   control (p 0.05) from 45.7  0.4% to 54.8  1.1%  for  9 uM FB1, whereas no change occurs in  the  number of cells in the phase G0/G1. These  results  show that cytotoxic concentrations of  FB1  induce cellular cycle arrest in phase G2/uM  in rat  C6 glioma cells possibly in relation  with  genotoxic events.",

Sphingolipids are thought to be involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and neoplastic transformation through participation in cell-cell communication and cell-substratum interactions and possibly through interactions with cell receptors and signalling systems. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with fumonisins B1 and B2 inhibited incorporation of (14)C serine into the sphingosine moiety of cellular sphingolipids, at an IC50 of 0.1 uM. In contrast, fumonisin B1 increased the amount of the biosynthetic intermediate, sphinganine, which suggests that fumonisins inhibit the conversion of (14)C-sphinganine to N-acyl-(14)C-sphinganines, a step that is thought to precede introduction of the 4,5-trans double bond of sphingosine. In agreement with this mechanism, fumonisin B1 inhibited the activity of sphingosine N-acyltransferase (ceramide synthase) in rat liver microsomes, with 50% inhibition at approximately 0.1 uM, and reduced the conversion of (3)H-sphingosine to (3)H-ceramide by intact hepatocytes. Fumonisin B1 (1 uM) almost completely inhibited (14)C sphingosine formation by hepatocytes.",

The pure substance is a white hygroscopic powder and is soluble in water, acetonitrile-water and methanol. The material is stable at food processing temperatures and light. Fumonisin B1 is the most common fungal metabolite associated with maize. Significant accumulation in maize occurs when weather conditions favor kernel rot. HUMAN EXPOSURE: There are no confirmed records of acute toxicity associated with this compound. Available correlation studies suggest a link between dietary exposure and esophageal cancer. Other studies are inconclusive as to the potential carcinogenicity of Fumonisin B1. ANIMAL/PLANT STUDIES: Fumonisin B1 is hepatotoxic in all animal species tested including mice, rats, equids, pigs, rabbits and non-human primates. With the exception of Syrian hamsters, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity is only observed concurrent with or subsequent to maternal toxicity. Fumonisins are nephrotoxic in pigs, rats, sheep, mice and rabbits. In rats and rabbits, renal toxicity occurs at lower doses than hepatotoxicity. The fumonisins are known to cause equine leukoencephalomalacia and porcine pulmonary edema syndrome. It is hepatocarcinogenic to male rats in one strain and nephrocarcinogenic in another strain. Fumonisin B1 is a specific inhibitor of de novo sphingolipid metabolism. This compound inhibits cell growth and causes accumulation of free sphingoid bases and alteration of lipid metabolism in animals, plants and in some yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisae. It did not induce gene mutations in bacteria or unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes, but induced a dose dependent increase in chromosomal aberrations at low concentrations. This compound is phytotoxic, damages cell membranes and reduces chlorophyll synthesis. This compound is poorly absorbed when dosed orally based on studies using pigs, laying hens and Vervet monkeys and it is rapidly eliminated from the plasma or circulation and recovered in the feces; biliary excretion is important; enterohepatic cycling is important in some animals. Small amounts are excreted in the urine, and some is retained in the liver and kidney.[",

This causes the accumulation of sphinganine, sphingosine, and possibly also sphingosine 1-phosphate in cells and tissues, leading to apoptosis. Mycotoxins are often able to enter the liver and kidney by human organic anion transporters (hOATs) and human organic cation transporters (hOCTs). They can also inhibit uptake of anions and cations by these transporters, interefering with the secretion of endogenous metabolites, drugs, and xenobiotics including themselves. This results in increased cellular accumulation of toxic compounds causing nephro- and hepatotoxicity. (A704, L1937, A2947, A3014)",

Fumonisin ingestion increases plasma and tissue sphingosine and sphinganine concentrations and causes porcine pulmonary edema, which has been attributed to acute left-sided heart failure or increased vascular permeability. We investigated the effect of short-term ingestion of fumonisin B1-containing culture material on cardiac function in pigs. Treated male pigs (n = 7) received fumonisin-containing culture material which was mixed into the grower diet at 20 mg fumonisin B1/kg body weight each day, while control pigs (n = 7) were fed only the grower diet on the same schedule as the treated pigs. Pigs were anesthetized after 3 days of receiving either diet and instrumented to accurately characterize the cardiovascular effects of fumonisin ingestion. Fumonisin-treated pigs had lower cardiac outputs and heart rates than control pigs. Fumonisin-treated pigs also had a marked reduction in cardiac contractility, as indicated by decreased values for end-systolic elastance (the gold standard in vivo measure of cardiac contractility), V0 (the intercept value for the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship), and mechanical efficiency. These data indicate that in pigs, short-term ingestion of fumonisin B1-containing culture material produces negative inotropic and chronotropic effects and decreases mechanical efficiency of the left ventricle. Theses cardiovascular effects are consistent with fumonisin-induced, sphingosine-mediated L-type Ca2+ channel blockade and suggest that pulmonary edema in pigs fed fumonisin is primarily due to acute left-sided heart failure instead of increased vascular permeability.",

For each day of dosing, 24-hr urine samples were collected and analyzed for creatinine and protein content and the enzymes -glutamyltranspeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase, and N-acetyl- -D-glucosaminidase. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, animals were killed and kidneys removed for ion transport measurement and histopathology. Significant increases in urine volume and decreases in urine osmolality were observed in both FB1 dose groups. Creatinine excretion was decreased only in the 10 mg FB1/kg group on the final day of the study. Urine protein excretion was elevated in both treated groups and found to be due primarily to high-molecular-weight proteins indicative of increased glomerular permeability. Enzymuria, a marker of tubular cell damage, was also observed with increases in the urinary excretion of all three enzymes measured. In renal cortical slices tubular transport of the anion p-aminohippuric acid was reduced by 75-80% and cationic transport of tetraethylammonium was reduced by 40% in the FB1-treated animals. While these results suggest significant alterations in renal function, only minor histopathologic changes were observed in the kidneys of both dose groups. Results of the present study indicate that urine volume, proteinuria, enzymuria, and ion transport are sensitive indicators of early FB1-induced nephrotoxicity.",

CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2 yr feed studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of fumonisin B1 in male F344/N rats based on the incr incidences of renal tubule neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of fumonisin B1 in female F344/N rats exposed to 5, 15, 50 or 100 ppm. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of fumonisin B1 in male B6C3F1 mice exposed to 5, 15, 80 or 150 ppm.

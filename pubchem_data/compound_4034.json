PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Motion sickness is also regulated by CTZ. The blood-brain barrier near the CTZ is relatively permeable to circulating mediators and CTZ can transmit impulses to vomiting center located in the brainstem. Different receptors responding to different factors, including histamine, 5-HT, enkephalins, substance P, and dopamine, are expressed along the brainstem to activate respective pathways and contribute to the control of vomiting. Histamine H1 receptors are expressed on the vestibular nuclei and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) that are activated by motion sickness and stimuli from the pharynx and stomach. When activated, H1 receptor signaling from these nuclei is transmitted to the CTZ and vomiting centre.   Through its antagonistic action on the H1 receptors, meclizine primarily works by inhibiting signaling pathway transduction through histaminergic neurotransmission from the vestibular nuclei and NTS to the CTZ and medullary vomiting center. Meclizine may also decrease the labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation.",

However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take your medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.

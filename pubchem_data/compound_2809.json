Similar to other benzodiazepines, the active metabolite of clorazepate enhances the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to the GABA type A (GABA-A) receptor, which promotes channel opening and neuronal hyperpolarization. The concomitant use of clorazepate and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Also, the use of clorazepate exposes users to users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, and its continued use may lead to significant physical dependence. In September 2020, a black box warning describing these risks was included on the product label of benzodiazepines as per FDA regulation. Clorazepate and its active metabolite, nordiazepam, are present in breast milk.",

As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell.",

Symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, headache, muscle spasm, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, tremor, postural hypotension, and weakness. A spectrum of affective disorders (psychosis, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, delirium) and motor dysfunction (tremor, restlessness, myoclonic jerk, seizures) may develop in serious cases after withdrawal from high daily doses (60-300 mg). Seizures are rare and most commonly develop 7 to 8 days after withdrawal (range, 2-12 days). The most common symptoms in minor to moderate withdrawal are mood swings and convulsion. Withdrawal symptoms usually peak in 5 to 6 days and resolve by 4 weeks, but minor symptoms may persist for months. The presence of tinnitus, involuntary movements, or perceptual changes helps differentiate benzodiazepine withdrawal from anxiety. /Benzodiazepines/",

Studies in healthy men have shown that clorazepate has depressant effects on the central nervous system. Since orally administered clorazepate dipotassium is rapidly decarboxylated to form nordiazepam, there is essentially no circulating parent drug. The use of benzodiazepines, including clorazepate, exposes users to abuse, misuse, and addiction risks, which can lead to overdose and death. Patients treated with clorazepate may also develop suicidal behavior and ideation, and the use of clorazepate may cause interference with psychomotor performance. The concomitant use of clorazepate with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Benzodiazepines are able to enhance the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to the GABA type A (GABA-A) receptor by binding to a region in the extracellular domain found at the interface between the alpha (\u03b1) and gamma (\u03b3) subunits of the GABA-A receptor. The interaction of GABA and the GABA-A receptor promotes channel opening, leading to an increased chloride influx. Consequently, the use of benzodiazepines, such as clorazepate, leads to neuronal hyperpolarization.",

Benzodiazepine receptors are most concentrated in the cerebral cortex but are also found in the cerebellum, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and spinal cord. Receptors have also been identified outside CNS, although peripheral receptors do not appear to have significant physiologic effects. The molecular receptor for the benzodiazepine molecule is a glycoprotein located on the lipid membranes of both neural and glial cells. It is speculated that there are at least two classes of benzodiazepine receptor believed to mediate different specific effects. Type I receptors predominate in the cerebelar cortex, and both type I and type II receptors are found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Type I rceptors are postulated to mediate anxiolytic effects, and type II receptors mediate the sedative and other actions of benzodiazepines. No endogenous ligand or neurotransmitter for these receptors has been identified. /Benzodiazepines/",

White or light yellow solid crystals which are soluble in water, practically insoluble in acetone, in chloroform in dichloromethane and in ether. HUMAN EXPOSURE: Main risks and target organs: Central nervous system, causing depression of respiration and consciousness. Summary of clinical effects: Central nervous system (CNS) depression and coma, or paradoxical excitation, but deaths are rare when benzodiazepines are taken alone. Deep coma and other manifestations of severe CNS depression are rare. Sedation, somnolence, diplopia, dysarthria, ataxia and intellectual impairment are the most common adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Overdose in adults frequently involves co-ingestion of other CNS depressants, which act synergistically to increase toxicity. Elderly and very young children are more susceptible to the CNS depressant action. Intravenous administration of even therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines may produce apnea and hypotension.  Dependence may develop with regular use of benzodiazepines, even in therapeutic doses for short periods. If benzodiazepines are discontinued abruptly after regular use, withdrawal symptoms may develop. Acute poisoning: Ingestion: The onset of impairment of consciousness is relatively rapid in benzodiazepine poisoning.  Onset is more rapid following larger doses and with agents of shorter duration of action. The most common and initial symptom is somnolence.  This may progress to coma Grade I or Grade II (see below) following very large ingestions. Reed Classification of Coma: Coma Grade I:  Depressed level of consciousness, response to  painful stimuli.  Deep tendon reflexes and vital signs intact. Coma Grade II:  Depressed level of consciousness, no response to painful stimuli.  Deep tendon reflexes and vital signs intact. Coma Grade III: Depressed level of consciousness, no response to painful stimuli.  Deep tendon reflexes absent. Vital signs intact. Coma Grade IV:  Coma grade III plus respiratory and circulatory collapse. Parenteral exposure: Overdose by the intravenous route results in symptoms similar to those associated with ingestion, but they appear immediately after the infusion, and the progression of central nervous system (CNS) depression is more rapid. Acute intentional poisoning by this route is uncommon and most cases are iatrogenic. Rapid intravenous infusion may cause hypotension, respiratory depression and apnea. Chronic poisoning: Ingestion: Toxic effects associated with chronic exposure are secondary to the presence of the drug and metabolites and include depressed mental status, ataxia, vertigo, dizziness, fatigue, impaired motor co-ordination, confusion, disorientation and anterograde amnesia. Paradoxical effects of psychomotor excitation, delirium and aggressiveness also occur. These chronic effects are more common in the elderly, children and patients with renal or hepatic disease.  Administration of therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines for 6 weeks or longer can result in physical dependence, characterized by a withdrawal syndrome when the drug is discontinued. With larger doses, the physical dependence develops more rapidly. Parenteral exposure: The chronic parenteral administration of benzodiazepines may produce thrombophlebitis and tissue irritation, in addition to the usual symptoms. Systematic description of clinical effects: Cardiovascular:  Hypotension, bradycardia and tachycardia have been reported with overdose. Hypotension is more frequent when benzodiazepines are ingested in association with other drugs.  Rapid intravenous injection is also associated with hypotension. Respiratory:  Respiratory depression may occur in benzodiazepine overdose and the severity depends on dose ingested, amount absorbed, type of benzodiazepine and co-ingestants. Respiratory depression requiring ventilatory support has occurred in benzodiazepine overdoses. The dose-response for respiratory depression varies between individuals.  Respiratory depression or respiratory arrest may rarely occur with therapeutic doses. Benzodiazepines may affect the control of ventilation during sleep and may worsen sleep apnea or other sleep-related breathing disorders, especially in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiac failure. Neurological: Central nervous system (CNS): CNS depression is less marked than that produced by other CNS depressant agents. Even in large overdoses, benzodiazepines usually produce only mild symptoms and this distinguishes them from other sedative-hypnotic agents.  Sedation, somnolence, weakness, diplopia, dysarthria, ataxia and intellectual impairment are the most common neurological effects. The clinical effects of severe poisoning are sleepiness, ataxia and coma. Grade I to Grade II (Reed). The presence of more severe coma suggests the possibility of co-ingested drugs.  The elderly and very young children are more susceptible to the CNS depressant action of benzodiazepines.  The muscle relaxation caused by benzodiazepines is of CNS origin and manifests as dysarthria, incoordination and difficulty standing and walking. Gastrointestinal: Oral benzodiazepine poisoning will produce minimal effects on the gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract but can occasionally cause nausea or vomiting. Endocrine and reproductive systems: Galactorrhoea with normal serum prolactin concentrations has been noted in 4 women taking benzodiazepines. Allergic reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis are rare. Other clinical effects: Hypothermia was reported in 15% of cases in one series. Pregnancy: Passage of benzodiazepines across the placenta depends on the degree of protein binding in mother and fetus, which is influenced by factors such as stage of pregnancy and plasma concentrations of free fatty acids in mother and fetus. Adverse effects may persist in the neonate for several days after birth because of immature drug metabolizing enzymes. The abuse of benzodiazepines by pregnant women can cause withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. The administration of benzodiazepines during childbirth can produce hypotonia, hyporeflexia, hypothermia and respiratory depression in the newborn. Breast feeding: Benzodiazepines are excreted in breast milk in significant amounts and may result in lethargy and poor feeding in neonates.  Benzodiazepines should be avoided in nursing mothers. Other: Dependence and withdrawal: Benzodiazepines have a significant potential for abuse and can cause physical and psychological dependence. Abrupt cessation after prolonged use causes a withdrawal syndrome. The mechanism of dependence is probably related to functional deficiency of GABA activity.  Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, tremor, weakness, perspiration, irritability, hypersensitivity to visual and auditory stimuli, palpitations, tachycardia and postural hypotension. In severe and rare cases of withdrawal from high doses, patients may develop affective disorders or motor dysfunction: seizures, psychosis, agitation, confusion, and hallucinations.  The time of onset of the withdrawal syndrome depends on the half-life of the drug and its active metabolites; the symptoms occur earlier and may be more severe with short-acting benzodiazepines. Others risk factors for withdrawal syndrome include prolonged use of the drug, higher dosage and abrupt cessation of the drug. Abuse: Benzodiazepines, have been abused both orally and intravenously. /Clorazepate dipotassium/",

As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell.",

However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.If you take this medication regularly and then suddenly stop taking it, you could have withdrawal symptoms. It is not known what effects, if any, withdrawal might have on a pregnancy. Your healthcare providers can help with slowly stopping this medication if you plan to stop using clorazepate.",

In such cases the use of agents such as norepinephrine bitartrate injection, USP or metaraminol bitartrate injection, USP should be considered. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected.

Oral doses of diazepam (10-60 mg) may require up to several days for improvement. High-dose benzodiazepine abusers have been treated effectively with an initial diazepam dose of 40% maintenance levels followed by a daily tapering by 10%. More gradual reductions are recommended for patients in an outpatient setting who have lower abuse potential. Withdrawal program duration ranges from 4 to 16 weeks with a daily reduction of 0.5 to 2.5 mg diazepam. Weekly physician visits are necessary to assess both physical symptoms and coping mechanisms. Important determinants of success are the development of good social support and alternate coping strategies. Anxiety modulation, which concentrates on alleviating anxiety symptoms by altered perceptions and attitudes, may relieve the initial distress that leads to benzodiazepine use. Propranolol and clonidine may attenuate symptoms but usually do not alleviate them. Antidepressants, which may reduce benzodiazepine receptors in the brain, appear to be useful during benzodiazepine withdrawal when they are begun a few months before withdrawal. Careful observation is necessary for evidence of lowered seizure threshold by the antidepressants. Further clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of antidepressants in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal. /Benzodiazepines/",

Since it reverses only benzodiazepine-induced CNS depression, it is diagnostic as well as therapeutic. The antagonist can confirm a suspected diagnosis of benzodiazepine overdose or exclude benzodiazepine intoxication as a cause of CNS depression in an undiagnosed patient. In coma, secondary to multiple drug overdose, removing the benzodiazepine component may avoid the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Flumazenil may be useful postoperatively to reverse the effects of preoperative sedation, or to reverse an inadvertent overdose when benzodiazepines are used for conscious sedation in outpatients. /Benzodiazepines/",

If ingestion of the drug is recent an the patient is fully conscious, emesis should be induced. If the patient is comatose, gastric lavage may be done if an endotracheal tube with cuff inflated is in place to prevent aspiration of gastri contents. Activated charcoal and a saline cathartic may be administered after gastric lavage and/or emesis to remove any remaining drug. Pulse, respiration, and blood pressure should be monitored and the patient should be closely observed. IV fluids should be administered and an adequate airway maintained. Hypotension may be controlled, if necessary, by IV administration of norepinephrine or metaraminol. Although some manufacturers recommend use of caffeine and sodium benzoate to combat CNS depression, most authorities believe caffeine and other analeptic agents should not be used, because these drugs have questionable benefit and transient action. Hemodialysis is not useful in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdosage. /Benzodiazepines/",

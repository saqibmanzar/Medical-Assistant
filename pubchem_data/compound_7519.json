When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It may also be formed during the combustion of hydrocarbons and therefore may be produced both naturally and anthropogenically when hydrocarbons are burned. Anisole has a low adsorptivity to soil and if released on soil, may leach. It has a moderately high Henry's Law constant and vapor pressure and would be expected to volatilize from both moist and dry soil surfaces. Anisole is readily biodegradable in screening tests and may therefore biodegrade in soil. If released in water, anisole will be lost by volatilization. Its volatilization half-life in a model river and model lake is estimated to be 3.2 hr and 4.2 days, respectively. It would also be expected to biodegrade. Experiments performed in a model aquatic ecosystem demonstrated that anisole was metabolized in aquatic organisms and did not bioconcentrate. Over a period of 24 hr, the concentration of anisole was decreased by approximately 93% and degradation products were found in the water. In the atmosphere, anisole will react with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals resulting in an estimated half-life of 22 hr. Workplace exposure to anisole may be by inhalation or dermal contact. The general population may be exposed to anisole in exhaust fumes and from ingesting meat. (SRC)",

Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.2 hr and 4.2 days, respectively(4,SRC). Anisole has been demonstrated to be readily biodegradable in screening tests(5,6) and therefore may biodegrade in natural water(SRC). When anisole was added to a model aquatic ecosystem with fish, mosquito larva, alga, daphnia, and snails and incubated for 24 hr, the concentration of anisole was considerably reduced (by approximately 93%) and degradation products were found in the water(1). A Russian study reported that anisole was stable in water for 4 days(2). The details of the study were not available. According to a recommended classification scheme(8), experimental bioaccumulation factors obtained from a model aquatic ecosystem along with evidence of metabolism in aquatic organisms(1) suggests that bioaccumulation of anisole should not be a concern(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

After 24 hr exposure, the ecological magnification for anisole was (organism, bioaccumulation factor): fish, 22; mosquito larva, 27; algae, 563; daphnia, 771; snails, 899(1). There were signs of considerable metabolism in all species. O-dealkylate occurred in fish and snail, hydroxylation to o- and p-methoxyphenols occurred in all species except daphnia, and conjugation occurred in alga and snails(1).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Using this value for the Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep flowing at 1 m/s with a wind speed of 3 m/s) is estimated as 3.2 hr(2,SRC). Similarly, the volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind volocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as 4.2 days(2,SRC). Anisole's moderate vapor pressure, 3.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(3), low adsorptivity to soil, and high Henry's Law constant(1,SRC) indicate that volatilization from dry and moist soil may occur(SRC).",

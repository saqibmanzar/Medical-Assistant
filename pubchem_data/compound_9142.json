When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered sc 0.4 uM doses of these polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Results from HPLC and MS demonstrated that benz(a)anthracene was observed to undergo bioalkylation and biooxidation reactions in rat sc tissue. The other compounds tested did not demonstrate detectable bioalkylation reactions in vivo. These results were consistent with the carcinogenic activity of benz(a)anthracene and the noncarcinogenic potential of the other compounds examined. The data indicated that the metabolic activation of nonfunctional carcinogenic aromatic hydrocarbons was due to the introduction of an alkyl group in a highly reactive mesoanthracenic center in the molecule. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether the bioalkylation reaction can be used as a general probe for the carcinogenic activity of nonfunctional polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.",

There are more than 100 different PAHs. PAHs generally occur as complex mixtures (for example, as part of combustion products such as soot), not as single compounds. PAHs usually occur naturally, but they can be manufactured as individual compounds for research purposes; however, not as the mixtures found in combustion products. ... Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar. They are found throughout the environment in the air, water, and soil. They can occur in the air, either attached to dust particles or as solids in soil or sediment. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Therefore, the levels which may result in incremental increase of cancer risk over the lifetime are estimated at 1X10-5, 1X10-6, and 1X10-7.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Perylene did not induce mutations in cultured human lymphoblastoid cells. Perylene exerted a cytotoxic effect on human keratinocytes in vitro. The agent is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. ANIMAL STUDIES: Perylene dermal applications, or i.p. injections did not induce tumors in mice. Benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase activity of the rat placenta can be induced by perylene. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Perylene did not induce 7-ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD) activity in the rainbow trout liver cells.",

Normal human keratinocytes were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of 1-methylpyrene and perylene either alone or in combination. Following incubation, keratinocyte adhesion, viability, proliferation, colony-forming efficiency, and apoptosis/necrosis level were examined. The effects of PAH on wound healing were also determined in vitro using a scrape-wound healing assay on epidermis-like tissue. In addition, the inflammatory cell response to PAH insult was examined through interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion. Each individual PAH significantly decreased keratinocyte adhesion and viability in a concentration-dependent manner, which was associated with a reduced ability of keratinocytes to proliferate and form colonies. When PAH were combined, a greater effect on keratinocyte adhesion, viability, and proliferation was noted. Decreased cell proliferation/colony-forming efficiency was accompanied by increased cell apoptosis following incubation with either PAH. This effect was enhanced by the inhibitory influence on keratinocyte migration, as assessed by culture scratching. Each PAH also exerted a significant effect on keratinocyte immune functions by modulating the secretion of inflammatory mediators. Indeed, 1-methylpyrene or perylene, individually or when combined, significantly upregulated IL-1alpha and IL-6 secretion. This effect was greater and was concentration dependent when the PAH combination was used. Overall results indicate that 1-methylpyrene and perylene exerted a cytotoxic effect on human keratinocytes. ...",

Normal human keratinocytes were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of 1-methylpyrene and perylene either alone or in combination. Following incubation, keratinocyte adhesion, viability, proliferation, colony-forming efficiency, and apoptosis/necrosis level were examined. The effects of PAH on wound healing were also determined in vitro using a scrape-wound healing assay on epidermis-like tissue. In addition, the inflammatory cell response to PAH insult was examined through interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion. Each individual PAH significantly decreased keratinocyte adhesion and viability in a concentration-dependent manner, which was associated with a reduced ability of keratinocytes to proliferate and form colonies. When PAH were combined, a greater effect on keratinocyte adhesion, viability, and proliferation was noted. Decreased cell proliferation/colony-forming efficiency was accompanied by increased cell apoptosis following incubation with either PAH. This effect was enhanced by the inhibitory influence on keratinocyte migration, as assessed by culture scratching. Each PAH also exerted a significant effect on keratinocyte immune functions by modulating the secretion of inflammatory mediators. Indeed, 1-methylpyrene or perylene, individually or when combined, significantly upregulated IL-1alpha and IL-6 secretion. This effect was greater and was concentration dependent when the PAH combination was used. Overall results indicate that 1-methylpyrene and perylene exerted a cytotoxic effect on human keratinocytes. ...",

When the duration and cell density of exposure were increased, the EC(50) for EROD induction was relatively constant for TCDD, but increased for PAHs. Regardless of exposure conditions, EROD activity was not induced by 9 PAHs: naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, perylene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, and fluoranthene. Two PAHs, benzo[g,h,i]perylene and coronene, induced EROD activity inconsistently. The remaining 13 PAHs consistently induced EROD activity. The EC(50)s for induction exhibited approximately a 110-fold range. The order of potency, from most to least potent, was benzo[k]fluoranthene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, dibenzo [a,h]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, benzo [b]fluoranthene, pentacene, benzo[b]anthracene, benzo[b] fluorene, chrysene, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[e]pyrene, and triphenylene. When the induction potency was expressed relative to TCDD, the toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) ranged from 0.001 to 0.00001. When expressed relative to benzo[a]pyrene, the TEFs ranged from 3.44 to 0.03.",

The objectives of this work were: (1) to follow the toxicity of high concentrations of perylene (110 mg/L) on benthic bacteria and macrofauna (amphipod Corophium multisetosum); (2) to determine the effects of a low load of perylene(2 ug/L) on the metabolism of suspended bacteriobenthos after 9-day exposure, mimicking the effects of tidal erosion; (3) to contrast the effects of this low perylene load on the particle-free bacterioplankton and on the suspended and particle-adhered bacteriobenthos. No impact was detected in bacterial abundance exposed to 110 mg perylene/L for 9 days. This concentration of perylene evoked no acute effects in C. multisetosum but, chronic toxicity assays revealed statistically significant negative effects on survival, growth and number of pregnant females. The bacterioplankton and the suspended bacteriobenthos, exposed to 2 ug perylene/L during 2 weeks, responded with altered profiles of activity when compared to the control suspension. These values ranged, respectively, for bacterial biomass production from 134 to 210 and from 24 to 184 ug C/L/hr, for aminopeptidase from 1824 to 11,127 and from 1464 to 15,488 nmol/L/hr, and for beta-glucosidase from 87 to 400 and from 57 to 1278 nmol/L/hr. The rate of oxygen consumption in the perylene-exposed suspension (0.04-2.85 mmol O2/kg dw sed/hr) exhibited a clearly distinct profile in relation to the control (0.57-1.60 mmol O2/kg dw sed/hr). The overall reactivity of the bacteriobenthos to perylene was interpreted as the result of toxic pressure followed by evolution of a diverse bacterial community.",

No CYP1A induction was observed with benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, acenaphthene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, and fluorene and low induction was found with fluoranthene and phenanthrene. All other PAHs with three and more benzene rings led to a concentration-related induction of CYP1A, with rebound decreases at high concentrations resulting in bell-shaped concentration-activity curves. Fish-related induction equivalency factors (IEFs) were estimated for all PAHs on the basis of EC50 values of their EROD activities and are reported here for the first time. The following order of decreasing IEFs was found: dibenz[a,h]anthracene > dibenzo[a,i]pyrene > benzo[k]fluoranthene > 3-methylcholanthrene > benzo[a]pyrene > benzo[e]pyrene > chrysene > 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene > perylene > benz[a]anthracene > pyrene. In contrast to the EROD activity, the immunodetectable protein content determined by ELISA showed a concentration-dependent increase. The interaction of PAHs in mixtures of up to eight individual compounds was additive based on their EROD activities. In landfill leachates, determined induction equivalents (IEQ) were significantly higher than calculated IEQs based on analytical measurements, which indicates additional unknown inducing compounds present in leachates. This study shows that the PLHC-1 cell in vitro system serves as an integrative bioanalytical tool in the ecotoxicological evaluation of aquatic environmental samples contaminated with CYP1A-inducing compounds.",

Perylene has been identified in mainstream cigarette smoke and sidestream cigarette smoke, emissions from burning coal, fresh and used motor oils and in gasolines. Perylene occurs in charcoal-broiled steaks, ribs, chicken and their atmospheric emissions. Exhaust from gasoline, diesel and jet fuel engines contains perylene. Perylene is released in flue gas emissions from municipal waste incineration. Perylene occurs as a natural component of fossil fuels and may be released to the environment from volcanoes and forest fires. There is no commercial production or known use for perylene. If released to air, an extrapolated super-cooled vapor pressure of 5.0X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates perylene will exist primarily in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. However, a small percentage will exist is the vapor phase. Vapor-phase perylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours. Particulate-phase perylene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Perylene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, perylene is expected to have no mobility based upon a mean Koc of 6.9X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Perylene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Soil degradation studies have observed slow degradation of perylene. After 287 days of incubation, only 22.0-42.1% of initial 5-7 ring PAHs (including perylene) disappeared from three soils. The photolysis of perylene sorbed to the surface of spruce needles from a tree has an observed half-life of 21 hours under sunlight irradiation. If released into water, perylene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Biodegradation of perylene reached 3-26% after 28 days of incubation in fresh and marine water-sediment degradation tests. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 6,700 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 0.87 days has been reported for perylene. The bioaccumulation factor of perylene in golden ide fish (Leuciscus idus melanotus) was determined to be <10 after 3 days. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to perylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where perylene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to perylene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing perylene.

Soil degradation studies have observed slow degradation of perylene(7-11). For example, after 287 days of incubation, 22.0-42.1% of initial 5-7 ring PAHs (including perylene) disappeared from three non-sterilized soils(10). Bioremediation studies in field soil plots found that five and six rings PAHS, including perylene, had <10% removal after 1 year of bioremediation(11). The photolysis of perylene sorbed to the surface of spruce needles, (Picea Abies), follows first-order kinetics with a half-life of 21 hours under sunlight irradiation(12).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 5X10-10 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 0.0004 mg/L(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 6,700(SRC), from its log Kow of 6.30(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, perylene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(9). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 0.87 days has been reported for perylene(10). The bioaccumulation factor of perylene in golden ide fish (Leuciscus idus melanotus) was determined to be <10 after 3 days(11). PAHs with four or more rings, such as perylene, do not biodegrade readily(12) and are expected to be resistant to biodegradation(13). Biodegradation of perylene reached 3-26% after 28 days of incubation in fresh and marine water-sediment degradation tests(14). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

Based on an estimated super-cooled vapor pressure of 1.5X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(3), a small percentage of perylene is expected to exist in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere(1). Ambient monitoring studies have detected perylene in both the particulate and vapor phases(4). Vapor-phase perylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase perylene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Perylene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(5,6) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). The photolytic half-life of perylene adsorbed to silica, alumina, fly ash, and carbon black substrates were measured as 3.9, 1.2, 33, and 865 hours, respectively, following irradiation with a 400 watt mercury lamp(7).",

After 1,280 days, 59.5% of an initial concentration of perylene (3.1 ug/g) remained in a soil treated with oil sludge at a concentration of 28.0 ug/g(2). Perylene was 0.02% degraded in soil after 30 days(3). Perylene, at a concentration of 0.05 ppm in the presence of 0.05 mg/L activated sludge, produced <0.1 percent carbon dioxide in 5 days(4). No biodegradation of perylene was observed within 16 months in sandy loam soil in the dark at 20 \u00b0C(5). After 287 days of incubation, 22.0-42.1% of initial 5-7 ring PAHs (including perylene) disappeared from three non-sterilized soils(6). Bioremediation studies in field soil plots found that five and six rings PAHS, including perylene, had <10% removal after 1 year of bioremediation(7).",

This rate constant corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 7.7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Perylene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Perylene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(3,4) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Perylene, irradiated with light at wavelengths greater than 290 nm, was found to be 41.3 percent degraded after 17 hours(5). The photolytic half-life of perylene adsorbed to silica, alumina, fly ash, and carbon black substrates were measured as 3.9, 1.2, 33, and 865 hours, respectively, following irradiation with a 400 watt mercury lamp(6). The photolysis of perylene sorbed to the surface of spruce needles, (Picea Abies), follows first-order kinetics with a half-life of 21 hours under sunlight irradiation(7).",

According to a classification scheme(3), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, perylene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(4). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 0.87 days has been reported for perylene(5). The bioaccumulation factor of perylene in golden ide fish (Leuciscus idus melanotus) was determined to be <10 after 3 days, the bioaccumulation factor of perylene in algae (Chlorella fusca) was determined to be 2,010 after 1 day, and the bioaccumulation factor of perylene in activated sludge was determined to be 22,900 after 5 days(6). Perylene was shown to bioaccumulate in worms exposed to contaminated sediment over a 4 week incubation period, reaching a max concentration of 227 ng/g(7). The bioconcentration factor for perylene in the Daphnid Pulex was determined to be 7,079(8). The half-life of perylene in rainbow trout, clams, mussels, oysters, and shrimp averaged 2, 4.3-26.2, 6.3-13.3, 9.2 and 1.2 days, respectively(9). The bioconcentration factor of perylene in polychaete worms was determined to be 16 (polychaeta dry wt/sediments dry wt) in Prionospio cirrifera/ Spiochaetpoterus costarum and 0.4 (polychaeta dry wt/sediments dry wt) in Capitella capitata(10).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Perylene was found in sediments collected at 10 sites in the Sudafjord, W Norway in concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 1757 ppb(2). Perylene was identified in sediment collected near various industrial emission sources on the Swedish Baltic Coast (concentrations not reported)(3). Marine sediment samples collected from the Baltic proper and from the Gulf in Finland were determined to have perylene concentrations of 50 and 65 ng/g, respectively(4). The concentration of perylene in 30 sediment samples collected at 15 different sites from the Gulf of Lion, France ranged from not detected to 264.3 ng/g(5). The average concentration of perylene in surface sediment samples taken from the Brisbane River Estuary, Australia from January-May 1986 was determined to range from 0.03 to 0.14 ug/g; the average perylene concentration range in particulates in water was determined to be 0.27-0.89 ug/g(6). Sediments collected in Tokyo Bay in July and Aug 1973 contained perylene at concentrations ranging from 0.006 to 0.305 mg/kg dry weight(7). Sediment samples (12) of various parts of Lake Lagoda, Russia collected in June 1993 were found to contain perylene ranging in concentration from 1.6 to 200 ng/g(8). The concentration of perylene in the sediment of an uncontrolled hazardous waste dump near the Nervion River, North Spain, was determined to range from 0.6 to 50 ug/g(9). Perylene, at levels of <0.10 ug/g, was one of many PAHs detected in 188 soil samples collected around the Tianjin area, China in the early 2000s(10). Sediments collected from the Pearl River Estuary and the North South China Sea in July 2002 contained perylene concentrations of 25-200 ng/g(10). Sediment cores (45 cm in depth) collected from remote mountain lake in central Chile had perylene concentrations ranging from about 300 to 5000 ng/g dry wt(11).",

The average concentration of perylene in the urban atmospheric particulate matter in Tokyo, Japan was determined to be 7.8 ug/g of particulates(3). The atmospheric perylene concentration at a roadside in Australia was measured as 0.22 ng/cu-m(4). Aerosol samples collected at six sites in Hong Kong during the winter months of 1993 were found to contain perylene concentrations ranging from 24 to 2060 pg/cu m(5). The seasonal concentration of perylene in the atmosphere of Barcelona, Spain was determined to be 2.65, not detected, 0.42, and 0.61 ng/cu m in spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively(6). Airborne particulate matter collected from nine places in the Upper Silesia Region of Poland during the winter of 1988/1989 and summer of 1989 had a perylene concentration range of 3.6 to 12.5 ng/cu m in the winter and 0.9 to 22.6 ng/cu m in the summer(7). Perylene concentrations in airborne particles sampled at four sites in an urban and industrialized area in the Netherlands ranged from 0.08 to 127.67 ng/cu m(8). Air sampling during March 2003 in Xigu District, Lanzhou, China detected a perylene concentration of 203 ng/cu m(9). Perylene was detected in ambient particulate matter collected at several areas in Stockholm, Sweden between 2003-2006 at levels of 10-100 pg/cu m(10).",

Air particulate matter collected in Bahrain from July 1991 to August 1991 during the burning of the oil fields in Kuwait were found to contain perylene concentrations ranging from <0.05 to 0.19 ng/cu-m(2). The concentration of perylene measured in underground Canadian mines in the vicinity of diesel vehicles was determined to range from 0.1 to 1.1 ng/cu m(3). The concentration of perylene in air samples collected from the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel in Baltimore, MD on three occasions in 1985 and 1986 was determined to average 8.0 ng/cu-m(4). Perylene was identified but not quantified in airborne particulate matter near a Horizontal Stud Soderberg plant in Quebec, Canada over a three month period during the Fall of 1992(5). Perylene was identified in a Soderberg, Norway anode plant and vertical pin plant; perylene particulate levels in the atmosphere ranged from 0.69 to 8.5 ug/cu-m in the anode plant and 0.56 to 1.8 ug/cu-m at the pin plant(6). The level of perylene in charcoal smoke and in charcoal and meat smoke from charcoal grilling was determined to be <0.1 ug/kg for both(7). The concentration of perylene in mesquite smoke and hickory smoke was determined to be 14 ug/kg and 4 ug/kg, respectively(8).",

Occupational exposure to perylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where perylene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to perylene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing perylene(SRC). Human exposure to perylene occurs primarily through the smoking of tobacco, inhalation of polluted air and by ingestion of food and drinking water contaminated with combustion products(2). In one study, workers were exposed to 0.04 to 1.24 ng/cu m perylene at different work sites of a silicon carbide process plant in Switzerland(3).",

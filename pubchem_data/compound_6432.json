The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

This model has six compartments: two lung compartments (alveolar and dead volume), and compartments for the heart, slowly perfused tissue, richly perfused tissue, and gastrointestinal tract. The model was developed to determine the distribution and excretion of the octafluoropropane in the body. Despite the high affinity of octafluoropropane for tissue, the model predicted that nearly 100% of the material would be exhaled from the lungs within 6 min. The model verified the results of a phase I clinical trial with 10 healthy subjects. Ventilation rate was found to play a critical role in the complete excretion of this contrast agent. ...",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

According to the histological analysis, OFP at the concentrations of 300 and 30 g/cu m had a politrophic toxic effect. Target organs were the lung, trachea, bronchus, heart, kidney, and the adrenaL There were dystrophic and necrobiotic lesions in the upper airways epithelium. Subacute and chronic vesicular bronchiolitis developed on days 7 and 14, respectively. Visceral organs and brain were found plethoric and the lung was found hemorrhagic. Similar lesions were seen in the trachea, bronchus, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, adrenal, heart, and the brain. Lipid redistribution was observed in the adrenal cortex and vascular reactions of renal tissue with juxtamedullar blood shunting. Toxicity of small OFP concentrations (3 and 0.3 g/cu m) was distinguished by an extended after effect, these concentrations did not cause visible pathomorphologic changes but gave rise to an extended pathologic process detectable by biochemistry. In all concentrations, OFP impacted erythrocyte metabolism changing the lipid composition of cell membrane and activating membrane-bound adenosinetriphos-phatases. The activities of hepatocyte and myocardiac cytoplasmatic enzymes were altered in blood plasma. Increased malonic dialdehyde in blood plasma and decreased cell antioxidant GSH in erythrocytes suggested exaggerated lipid peroxidation.",

This study assessed renal tissue injury in the larger porcine model. The right kidneys of anesthetized pigs were imaged in 8 groups of 4 pigs. A Vingmed System Five ultrasound machine (General Electric Co, Cincinnati, OH) was used at 1.5 MHz in the B-mode to intermittently scan the kidney at 4-second intervals. An Acuson Sequoia 512 machine (Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, CA) was used in the 1.5-MHz Cadence contrast pulse sequencing mode with intermittent agent clearance bursts at 4-second intervals. Kidneys were scanned transabdominally or after laparotomy through a saline standoff. The second machine's probe was placed in contact with the kidney for 1 group. A perflutren lipid microsphere contrast agent (Definity; Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc, North Billerica, MA) was infused at 4 uL/kg/min (diluted 33:1 in saline) for 4 minutes during scanning. Blood-filled urinary tubules were evident on the kidney surface for all groups except the group with the probe in contact with the kidney. Glomerular capillary hemorrhage was found by histologic processing in 31.7% +/- 9.8% (mean +/- SD) of glomeruli in the center of the scan plane for 1.7-MPa transabdominal scanning and 1.5% +/- 2.9% of glomeruli in sham samples (P < 0.05). In addition, hematuria was detected after scanning, and tubular obstruction occurred in some nephrons. Renal tissue damage was induced by CEDUS in the porcine model. This result, together with previous studies in rats, support a hypothesis that GCH would occur in humans from similar CEDUS exposure.",

The present study investigated the influence of contrast ultrasonography (US) with perflutren lipid microspheres, a recently developed second-generation contrast agent, on microvessels. Rat mesentery was exposed to 1.8-MHz pulsed US with intravenous injection of perflutren (0.1 or 1.0 mL/kg) or Levovist (300 mg/kg), and the microvessel bleeding and endothelial cell injury was examined. Impaired endothelial cells were identified by the fluorescence of propidium iodide. Microvessel bleeding was examined also in the rat myocardium. The interaction between 0.1 mL/kg of perflutren and US exposure did not cause microvessel bleeding, and did not increase endothelial cell injury compared with the sham operation, unless frequent, strong US exposure occurred. When the dose was increased to 1.0 mL/kg, the combination of perflutren and US exposure resulted in capillary bleeding and increased endothelial cell injury in capillaries and venules (p<0.01). However, the incidence of microvessel bleeding and endothelial cell injury did not exceed that with Levovist microbubbles. In the myocardium, microvessel bleeding was not observed under any conditions. In conclusion, perflutren lipid microspheres enhanced US-related microvessel injury as with other contrast agents at the dose of 1.0 mL/kg, but not with 0.1 mL/kg and the appropriate US setting.",

The chamber experiment was 43 days long. Intoxication by OFP reduced body mass, as well as the erythrocyte count and hemoglobin level in peripheral blood. As for BIA, it appeared to bring these indices back to their normal values. Erythrocyte metabolism underwent phase-by-phase shifts; but breathing BIA mitigated these shifts markedly. As regards to erythrocyte metabolism in intoxicated animals, BIA had a compensatory effect Changes in the biochemical profile of blood plasma make us think, that BIA counteracts the OFP damaging action on the myocardium and, at the same time, aggravates impairment of metabolism in the liver and, probably, kidney. Variations in the spectrum and total content of higher fatty acids in the lung in the experiment were more pronounced in the event of exposure to OFP+BIA than to OFP alone. Also, the combined exposure increased the level of laurinic acid. Histological investigations of the liver, spleen, myocardium, trachea and the lung attested to the dystrophic damage of the liver, spleen plethora and reticular hyperplasia, and slight cloudy swelling of the myocardium attributed to OFP. After 14 days since the end of the experiment, histological changes were much less dramatic; in 39 days after the experiment all the changes were gone with the exception of weak emphysematosis. BIA had no effect on animals in the absence of OFP; neither was there any significant difference between control (intact) animals and those who breathed BIA in laboratory. To conclude, 50 ug/cu m of OFP which falls far short of the existing maximum permissible levels, a strong toxic action on animals. Aside from mitigation of the OFP toxic action on erythrocytes and myocardium, BIA, when breathed with a long time, aggravated the metabolic disorders in the liver and lung provoked by OFP.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6630 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates octafluoropropane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase octafluoropropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. Octafluoropropane has an Ozone Depletion Potential of zero and a calculated atmospheric lifetime of 2600 years. Octafluoropropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, octafluoropropane is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 900. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 33 atm-cu m/mole. Octafluoropropane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, octafluoropropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 34 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to octafluoropropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where octafluoropropane is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to octafluoropropane via inhalation of ambient air. Exposure to octafluoropropane among the general population may include those administered the drug perflutren, a contrast agent. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

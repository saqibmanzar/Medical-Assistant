PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.8X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours. Bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate may also undergo direct photolysis in the environment, but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown. Particulate-phase bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,400. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.1X10-13 atm-cu m/mole. Bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based on its vapor pressure. Bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate, achieved 86 percent of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum, suggesting this compound may biodegrade in the environment. If released into water, bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 29 and 294 days at pH 8 and 7, respectively. An estimated BCF of 62 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate is produced or used.

Vapor-phase bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.4X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3) determined using a structure estimation method(3). Bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate may also undergo direct photolysis in the environment since this compound contains a functional group that can absorb light greater than 290 nm(4). Particulate-phase bis(2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethyl) adipate may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

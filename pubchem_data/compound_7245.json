They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, ingestion, inhalation, dermal contact), exposure to this colorless to yellow-brown liquid may occur from its use as an intermediate in the manufacture of dyes and higher chlorinated phenols, and as solvent or as a disinfectant. Effects from exposure include burns to the skin and eyes, weakness, headache, dizziness, damage to the lung, liver, and kidneys, and death from cardiac or pulmonary failure. Persons handling 2-chlorophenol should wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and chemical protective clothing specifically recommended by the shipper or producer. No skin surface should be exposed. However, if contact does occur, immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, and remove and isolate contaminated clothing. While 2-chlorophenol requires moderate heating to ignite (flash point 64 \u00b0C, closed cup), it can burn, with the production of irritating and poisonous gases, and containers of the substance may explode in the heat of a fire. For small fires involving 2-chlorophenol, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, or standard foam, and for large fires, use water spray, fog or standard fo~r. Runoff from fire control water may give off poisonous gases and should be controlled by diking, as necessary. 2-Chlorophenol should be stored away from oxidizing materials, and may be shipped via air, rail, road, or water in containers bearing the label, \"Keep away from food.\" Small spills of 2-chlorophenol may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. Dike far ahead of large spills for later disposal. 2-Chlorophenol is a good candidate for rotary kiln or liquid injection forms of incineration. Prior to implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

The second step, involving ultrasonic waves eliminated 2-chlorophenol through hydroxyl radical generated by the cavitation process (sono-degradation). In the third step, a combination of ultrasonic waves and enzyme was used (sono-enzyme degradation).",

The experiments were conducted by varying the initial pH values of o-CP solution from pH 6.3 to 9.8 and 11.8. From the results, it was revealed that the catalytic decomposition of o-CP occurred most effectively at 413 K and at the initial pH of 9.8. Complete decomposition and dechlorination of o-CP were almost achieved within 1hr, and about 85% of TOC was removed in 3.0 hr...",

The ability of chlorophenols to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation increases with increasing chlorination. In fact, studies indicate a concentration-dependent triphasic effect of chlorophenols on phosphorylation and cellular respiration. At low concentrations, uncoupling produces stimulation of the resting state respiration as a result of increased adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity in the absence of a phosphate acceptor.Inhibition of active respiration is also observed. At moderate concentrations, resting respiration is neither stimulated nor inhibited. Significant inhibition of respiration, associated with a breakdown of the\nelectron transport process and decreased ATPase activity, occurs at very high concentrations. Uncoupling activity has been attributed to a protonophoric effect (a disruption of the energy gradient across the mitochondrial membrane resulting from distribution of chlorophenols in the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane), whereas inhibition of cellular respiration has been attributed to a direct action on intracellular proteins (L159).",

Coupling photoproducts formed in ice samples (3'-chlorobiphenyl-2,4'-diol and 3-chlorobiphenyl-2,2'-diol from 2-CP photolysis and 5-chlorobiphenyl-2,4'-diol from 4-CP photolysis) were found to be more toxic to V. fisheri than parent CPs and elicited significant inductions of dioxin-like effects (the effective concentrations EC50 approximately 3 x 10-5 mol/L corresponded to known weaker ligands of AhR, such as nonplanar polychlorinated biphenyls or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). To complete the picture, a photoproduct formed from 4-CP (5-chlorobiphenyl-2,4'-diol) was synthesized, and a detailed toxicity assessment with purified compound confirmed the results obtained with irradiated samples. /The/ findings support a recently proposed model according to which solar radiation can trigger the formation of new types of organic pollutants in polar ice or tropospheric ice cloud particles, presenting possibly greater risk to the environment than the parent compounds.",

Based on the concentration of toxicant that reduced lysosomal uptake of neutral red by 50% (NR50), the rank order of cytotoxicity was methyl mercury greater than pentachlorophenol greater than 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenol greater than 2,3,5-trichlorophenol greater than 2,3-dinitrotoluene greater than 2,4,6-trichlorophenol greater than 2,4-dichlorophenol greater than 2,4-dichlorotoluene greater than 6-chloro-3-hydroxytoluene greater than o-chlorotoluene greater than 4-chlorophenol greater than 2-chlorophenol, 2,4-dimethylphenol greater than 2,4-dinitrophenol greater than 4-nitrophenol greater than 3-methylphenol greater than phenol greater than toluene. Published in vivo LC50 values were identified for 11 of the 18 test agents and, with the exception of 2,4-dinitrophenol, there was a good correlation between the in vitro cytotoxicity of the test agents and their in vivo waterborne acute toxocity. The potencies of the substituted phenolics and chlorinated toluenes as determined by the in vitro cytotoxicity assay correlated strongly with their log octanol/water partition coefficients (log P). However, the toxicity of 2,3-dinitrotoluene in vitro, and apparently also in vivo, was not a function of its log P value.",

A secondary spin trapping technique was used followed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis, to study the potential of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after fish (Carassius auratus) were injected ip with different doses (50, 100, 200, 250, 500 mg/kg) of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP). The ROS signal intensity of the EPR spectrum showed a significant increase (p<0.05, compared with the control) when the 2-CP dose was as low as 50 mg/kg. There is a good relationship between the 2-CP administered doses and ROS generation. ...  SOD and CAT activities were found to be induced at lower doses of 2-CP. GSH levels fell below the control level following all treatments with 2-CP, and GSSG levels changed along with those of GSH. These observations indicated that the fish experienced oxidative stress. The strong positive correlation (r = 0.966, p<0.005) between OH radical and lipid peroxidation suggested that lipid peroxidation was possibly induced by OH radical. The phase II detoxification enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) may play an important role in 2-CP metabolism or excretion and, consequently, reduce ROS production. This study provides strong evidence that level of ROS is significantly increased in 2-CP stressed fish, and ROS may serve as a potential biomarker to indicate 2-CP contamination.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.53 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-chlorophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-chlorophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.3 days. The main product of photolysis of the undissociated form of 2-chlorophenol was pyrocatechol; cyclopentadienic acid is the main photolysis product from the dissociated form. Photolysis product yields will be affected by pH. If released to soil, Koc values of 51 in clay loam soil and 398 in soil indicate that 2-chlorophenol will exhibit high to moderate mobility depending on soil type. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.12X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Chlorophenol may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. However, in conditions where 2-chlorophenol may bind strongly to soil, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Biodegradation of 94% after 6.5 hrs, 100% after 14-47 days and 67% after 10 days indicate that biodegradation of 2-chlorophenol in soil may be an important fate process. If released into water, 2-chlorophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the measured Kocs of 3,981 and 5,012 in course and fine sediment, respectively. Biodegradation of 2-chlorophenol in water may be an important fate process based upon reported complete losses in 10-36 days. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 days and 31 days, respectively. However, in conditions where 2-chlorophenol may bind strongly to suspended solids and sediments, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption in the water column. A BCF range of 6-214 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms will be low to high depending on the species. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-chlorophenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-chlorophenol is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 2-chlorophenol via ingestion of drinking water and fish, and dermal contact with vapors and other products containing 2-chlorophenol. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.12X10-5 atm-cu m/mole for the neutral species(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 days and 31 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), a BCF range of 6 to 215(6-8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms may be low to high depending upon the species(SRC). Biodegradation of 2-chlorophenol in water may be an important fate process based reported complete losses in 10-36 days(9-12).",

Vapor-phase 2-chlorophenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.3 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 9.9X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). The suggested half-life of 2-chlorophenol in air is 55 hrs(4). Photolysis of 2-chlorophenol is affected by pH as the quantum yields for the disappearance of the undissociated form was 10 times less than that for the dissociated form when 2-chlorophenol was irradiated at 296 nm in aqueous solution at pH 8-13. The main product of photolysis of the undissociated form was pyrocatechol and cyclopentadienic acid from the dissociated form(5).",

In an aerobic screening test, the microorganism Pseudomonas gladioli was able to degrade 2-chlorophenol 74.6% after an incubation period of 24 hours and an initial concn of 8.78 ug/ml(2). 2-Chlorophenol was 100% degraded by a microbial mixture inoculum after an incubation time of 96 hours(3). The aerobic biodegradation of 2-chlorophenol in the cyclone fermentor system revealed 0% remaining after 200 hours and a lag time of 25 hours; this corresponds to a half-life of 140 hours(4). Incubation at 30 \u00b0C resulted in incomplete removal of 2-chlorophenol, which ceased after 48 hours. 64.8% of 2-chlorophenol was removed; however, only 30.2% of the total chloride was released. Degradation proceeded via meta-cleavage and a build-up of the metabolite 3-chlorocatechol was observed(5). 2-Chlorophenol reached 38.0% of its theoretical BOD in river water obtained from the Jilin section of the Songhua River, China. A test concn of 2 mg/L (based on the Theoretical Oxygen Demand for 2-chlorophenol) was tested at 15-20 \u00b0C, pH 6.8-7.0, and a dissolved oxygen concn of 8.0 mg/L using standard iodometric tritration(6).",

Recoveries of residual 2-chlorophenol (days) in river die-away tests using Great Miami River, Ohio water was 980 ppb (0 days), 810 ppb (6 days), 710 ppb (23 days), 0 ppb (36 days), and in the Little Miami River, Ohio was 890 ppb (0 days), 870 ppb (6 days), 480 ppb (13 days), 0 ppb (15 days)(6). Addition of seed water from prior die-away testing led to faster complete removal of 2-chlorophenol in seeded vs unseeded Great Miami River, Ohio water (15 days vs 36 days), whereas time for complete removal in seeded Little Miami River,Ohio water was nearly the same as that in unseeded water (15 days vs 13 days)(6). A loss of 94% was reported for 2-chlorophenol incubated in non-sterile clay loam soil at 4 \u00b0C in 6.5 hrs and 1% loss in sterile soil in 12 days(2). Complete removal of 2-chlorophenol was reported in 14 and 47 days in Dunkirk and Mardin silt loam suspensions, respectively(3). Degradation of 67% 2-chlorophenol reported in 10 days upon percolation through Rothamsted clay; degradation was faster upon redose(4). Evolution of 13% and 25% theoretical CO2 in 1 and 10 weeks in para-brown soil reported(5). Complete disappearance of 2-chlorophenol was reported in aerobic columns of aquifer material contaminated by landfill leachate in 6 days for acclimated columns and 9 days in unacclimated columns; under anaerobic conditions degradation occurred only with aquifer material from an actively methanogenic site(7). Complete loss of 2-chlorophenol reported in sediment from farm stream at 20 \u00b0C in 10-15 days vs 19% in 30 days in sterile sediments(2). Complete degradation was reported in 3 days in acclimated sludge(8). 0% theoretical BOD in 11-19 days using  wastewater seed was observed(9); 100% and 0% biodegradation was reported using 2-chlorophenol concentrations of 5 ppm 10 ppm, respectively, and incubated with activated sludge(9). 95.6% removal in 6 hrs was observed using a test chemical concentration 200 ppm incubated with acclimated activated sludge(10).",

Results revealed 0 to 30% mineralization of 2-chlorophenol in digested sewage sludge after an incubation period of 56 days, 30 to 75% mineralization in freshwater swamp sediment after an incubation period of 56 days, and 0 to 30% mineralization in marine sediment after an incubation period of 96 days(1). The rate of 2-chlorophenol transformation in anaerobic estuarine sediment was determined to be 0.101/day, which corresponds to a half-life of 6.9 days(2). After a 30 day acclimation period, 2-chlorophenol was degraded with ease by soil microorganisms under nitrate-reducing conditions; 21% was biodegraded in 3 days and by 6 days, 2-chlorophenol reached low concns(3). The anaerobic degradation of 2-chlorophenol in the cyclone fermentor system resulted in 44% remaining after 500 hours and a lag time of 250 hours; this corresponds to a half-life of 475 hours(4). Incubation of 2-chlorophenol with sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions gave the following results: complete disappearance of 2-chlorophenol in 6 weeks with no lag period using unacclimated sludge; approximately 100% loss of 2-chlorophenol in 4 or 32 days with no lag period using sludge acclimated to 2- or 4-chlorophenol(5). Using 14C-labeled-2-chlorophenol in anaerobic sludge acclimated to 2-chlorophenol, >90% of total (14)C added was recovered as (14)CH4 and (14)CO2(5). Complete removal of 2-chlorophenol was achieved within 50 days in anaerobic sediment obtained from Lake Michigan. The major metabolites were phenol and 3-chlorobenzoate(6). 2-Chlorophenol biodegrades in the absence of oxygen under methanogenic, sulfidogenic, iron-reducing, and denitrifying conditions(7). The half-life of 2-chlorophenol in sub-soils under landfills was 51 and 110 days in coarse sand and sandy loam, respectively(8). 2-Chlorophenol (500 ug/L) was persistent in anaerobic sand and gravel after 2 weeks in a model ecosystem consisting of a laboratory filter operating with anaerobic groundwater(9).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3.3 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 2-Chlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Irradiation of 1 mmol/L aqueous solution of 2-chlorophenol in the presence of 50 mmol nitrate/L leads to the formation of the following dihydroxybenzenes: 2-hydroxyquinone, hydroquinone, 2-chlorohydroquinone, catechol, 3-chlorocatechol, 3-nitrocatechol(3). Since the pKa of 2-chlorophenol is 8.56(4), 2-chlorophenol will exist in a partially anionic state in water and moist soils; therefore, its transport should be affected by pH. Photolysis of 2-chlorophenol should also be affected by pH as demonstrated by the quantum yields for the disappearance of the undissociated form which was 10 times less (quantum yield = 0.03-0.04) than that for the dissociated form (quantum yield = 0.30) when 2-chlorophenol was irradiated at 296 nm in aqueous solution at pH 8-13; the main product of photolysis of the undissociated form was pyrocatechol and cyclopentadienic acid from the dissociated form(5). 2-Chlorophenol (4.46X10-5 mol) reacted with 1 ml NOx in 1 liter air for 5 hr to give the 4-nitro-2-chlorophenol and 6-nitro-2-chlorophenol adducts in 36% and 30% yields, respectively(6).",

Since the pKa of 2-chlorophenol is 8.56(2), 2-chlorophenol will exist in a partially dissociated state in water and moist soils; therefore, its transport should be affected by pH. Photolysis of 2-chlorophenol should also be affected by pH as demonstrated by the fact that the quantum yields for the disappearance of the undissociated form was 10 times less (quantum yield = 0.03-0.04) than that for the dissociated form (quantum yield = 0.30) when 2-chlorophenol was irradiated at 296 nm in aqueous solution at pH 8-13; the main product of photolysis of the undissociated form was pyrocatechol and cyclopentadienic acid from the dissociated form(3). 2-Chlorophenol (4.46X10-5 mol) reacted with 1 ml NOx in 1 liter air for 5 hr to give the 4-nitro-2-chlorophenol and 6-nitro-2-chlorophenol adducts in 36% and 30% yields, respectively(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

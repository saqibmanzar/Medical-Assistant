When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Plasma amino acid concentrations were estimated using an amino acid analyser, and in the 6-FT studies free tryptophan was determined by equilibrium dialysis. At least 3 weeks separated each ingestion. The drugs were given in marzipan at 0900 hr on each occasion. With 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg 6-FT the mean peak plasma levels of 6-FT were 24, 58 and 145 n mole/mL respectively, and each peak was observed at 11.00 hours. With pCPA (10 and 100 mg/kg) the mean peak plasma levels of pCPA were 59 and 343 n mole/mL, and peaks were observed at 1100 and 1300 hr respectively. It was not possible to measure the plasma levels after ingestion of pCPA (1 mg/kg). The plasma half times for 6-FT and pCPA were about 3.5 and 10.5 hours. In control studies plasma concentrations of tryptophan increased during the day, and reached their maximum during the afternoon. The increases in the plasma concentration at 1300 and 1700 hr were highly significant (P<0.01). Oral ingestion of 6- FT (30 and 100 mg/kg) and pCPA (1 and 100 mg/kg) abolished the increase in plasma tryptophan during the day, and total plasma tryptophan concentrations were reduced compared with control levels at the same time of the day. The duration of each effect appeared to be related to the plasma half time of the inhibitor.",

The enzyme inhibition can be correlated with and is assumed to be responsible for brain serotonin depletion. Although p-chlorophenylalanine is a competitive inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase in vitro, it causes an irreversible inactivation of the enzyme in vivo. The findings also support the conclusion that tryptophan hydroxylation is the rate-limiting step in serotonin biosynthesis.",

Some rats received treatments in combination. To separate strategies learning from spatial learning, half of the rats underwent Morris' water maze strategies pretraining before drug administration and spatial training. Individual depletion of serotonin or antagonism of beta-adrenergic receptors caused few or no impairments in either naive or pretrained rats in either version of the task. In contrast, combined depletion of serotonin and antagonism of beta-adrenergic receptors impaired naive rats in the visible platform task and impaired both naive and strategies-pretrained rats in the hidden platform task, and also caused sensorimotor impairments. ...",

Serotonin was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA 100 mg/kg, every other day); controls received saline. At puberty (P40), half the PCPA-treated rats and half the saline-treated rats began treatment with testosterone (T, 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week). Behavioral measures included locomotion, irritability, copulation, partner preference, and aggression. Animals were tested for aggression in their home cage, both with and without physical provocation (mild tail pinch). Brain levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were determined using HPLC. PCPA significantly and substantially depleted 5-HT and 5-HIAA in all brain regions examined. Chronic T treatment significantly decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA in certain brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than PCPA. Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or aggression. T alone had no effect on locomotion, irritability, or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and aggression. The most striking effect of combining T+PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack, particularly following physical provocation. Based on these data, it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central 5-HT may be especially prone to exhibit aggressive behavior.",

A single dose of MDMA (2-10-20 mg/kg iv) evoked a transient increase of interstitial glucose concentrations in striatum (139-223%) with rapid onset and of less than 2 hr duration, a concomitant but more prolonged lactate increase (>187%) at the highest MDMA dose and no significant depletions of striatal serotonin. Blood glucose and lactate levels were also transiently elevated (163 and 135%) at the highest MDMA doses. The blood glucose rises were significantly related to brain glucose and brain lactate changes. The metabolic perturbations in striatum and the hyperthermic response (+1.1 degrees C) following systemic MDMA treatment were entirely blocked in p-chlorophenylalanine pre-treated rats, indicating that these effects are mediated by endogenous serotonin.",

Naive male Long-Evans rats received injections of p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; 500 mg/kg x 2) to deplete serotonin or cysteamine (90 or 200 mg/kg) to deplete somatostatin, or both treatments prior to spatial and reversal training in the water maze. Some rats first received Morris' nonspatial pretraining to train them in the behavioral strategies that are required for successful spatial place learning in this task, prior to drug treatment and spatial training. A detailed behavioral analysis indicated that somatostatin or serotonin depletion alone caused little or no impairment in naive animals. Depletion of both somatostatin and serotonin in naive rats impaired performance, with differences in the impairments that depended on the dose of cysteamine. Nonspatially pretrained rats were not impaired. Thus, neither somatostatin nor serotonin alone is crucial for the water maze task, but impairments occur if both somatostatin and serotonin are depleted in naive rats. The results indicate that some of the performance impairment was due to strategies impairment rather than a spatial place learning impairment. Depletion of both somatostatin and serotonin in naive rats produces results comparable to the spatial navigation deficits seen in some Alzheimer patients and suggests that combinations of antagonist treatments may better model this disorder than single antagonist treatments do.",

Key aspects of recent advances include biochemical characterization of the first enzymatic step in tissue serotonin biosynthesis, that of tryptophan 5-hydroxylation; discovery of an inhibitor (para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA)) of the reaction; and observations on the effects of serotonin deprival as produced by PCPA in man and animals. Control of diarrhea in the carcinoid syndrome by PCPA treatment indicates that the major target organ of circulating serotonin is the intestinal tract. Induction of psychiatric effects with high doses of PCPA, along with other evidence, is compatible with a serotonin-deficiency hypothesis of affective illness. Serotonin plays a role in sleep mechanisms, with PCPA suppressing and 5-hydroxytryptophan (serotonin precursor) restoring rapid eye movement sleep in man. Finally, animal data raise exciting possibilities of the involvement of brain serotonin in control of sexual behavior.",

A 59-year-old man developed chronic diarrhea, hepatomegaly, right-sided valvular heart lesion, and cutaneous flush. Exploratory abdominal examination showed ileal carcinoid tumor metastatic to liver and nodes. Urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and serum 5-hydroxytryptamine levels were abnormally high. Para-chlorophenylalanine treatment promptly reduced both levels to normal and halted the diarrhea. Chronic treatment with para-chlorophenylalanine controlled the production of 5-hydroxytryptamine and diarrhea but did not prevent tumor growth, flushing, or progression of cardiac lesions. /Former/",

Four were too ill, and one had mild symptoms; thus 13 received a periembolisation regimen of cyproheptadine, fenclonine, aprotinin, methylprednisolone, tobramycin, flucloxacillin, and metronidazole. Embolization was not performed in one patient with an occluded portal vein and was unsatisfactory in two others, in one because she was moribund and in the other because the hepatic artery had been ligated. Dramatic improvement in symptoms occurred in the nine patients in whom embolisation was successfully carried out, with abolition of flushing, severe abdominal pain, and wheeze and reduction in diarrhea from 10.5 (SD 7.6) to 1.6 (0.9) stools/day. Urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid fell from 1048 (716) to 289 (184) umol/24 hr (200 (137) to 55 (35) mg/24 hr). Complications included one death from septicaemia, a hepatic abscess requiring surgical drainage, abdominal pain in three patients, pleural effusion in two, and transient encephalopathy in one. Relief of symptoms lasted for one to 24 months, and second embolisation in two patients produced further remissions of four to six months. Five patients died, one to 40 months after embolisation, in four cases because of metastases or heart failure. ... /Former/",

Slow wave sleep (SWS) was defined as the non-REM sleep (NREMS) fraction with a low predominant EEG frequency. In the 24 hr following PCPA administration, motor activity and food intake were reduced and sleep was increased. SWS was massively enhanced, while REM sleep (REMS) was depressed. The initial phase of sedation was followed by a phase of partial insomnia lasting 1-2 days. SWS and REMS were particularly depressed. A rebound phenomenon was observed at the end of recovery period when some of the SWS and REMS values exceeded the control level. The administration of tryptophan (Trp, 150 mg/kg ip) 28 hr after PCPA pretreatment, causing a significant rise in the brain serotonin (5-HT) concentration, produced a temporary increase in SWS and REMS, and a reduction of motor activity. The experiments show that the depression of SWS and REMS, and the hyperactivity 1-2 days after PCPA administration, are a consequence of the reduced 5-HT level, whereas the involvement of serotonergic mechanisms in the initial sedative phase and in the recovery phase is less clear. The persistence of the daily distribution of sleep and activity, and of the specific pattern of SWS and REMS, indicates that the circadian sleep organization is little affected by 5-HT depletion.",

After treatment, some of the male cats showed mounting behaviour and the kittens and non-estrous females showed an increase in treading and rubbing which was similar to one aspect of pro-estrus behavior.  The treated animals also appeared to suffer from skin irritation and showed increased restlessness which accompanied sleep deprivation. Injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan stopped abnormal sexual activity and restored normal sleep for about 5 hours. It is concluded that 5-hydroxytryptamine-containing neurones inhibit sexual behaviour in cats and that this role can be seen in male and, to some extent, also in female animals.",

The functional integrity of the tonic nociceptive response was investigated in 25 day old rats using the classic formalin test. Morphological analysis of brain structures involved in formalin-induced pain and 5-HT levels in the heads of 12-day embryos were also evaluated. Embryonic levels of 5-HT were significantly lowered by the treatment. The juvenile rats from pCPA-treated females showed altered brain morphology and cell differentiation in the developing cortex, hippocampus, raphe nuclei, and substantia nigra. In the formalin test, there were significant decreases in the intensity and duration of the second phase of the formalin-induced response, characterizing persistent, tonic pain. The extent of impairments in the brain structures correlated positively with the level of decrease in the behavioral responses. The data demonstrate the involvement of 5-HT in the prenatal development of the tonic nociceptive system. The decreased tonic component of the behavioral response can be explained by lower activity of the descending excitatory serotonergic system originating in the raphe nuclei, resulting in decreased tonic pain processing organized at the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The primary site of action appears to be the motor cortex where spread of seizure activity is inhibited. Possibly by promoting sodium efflux from neurons, mephenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of posttetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of posttetanic potentiation prevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas. Mephenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Both reactions were localized in the microsomal fraction and required NADPH. Inhibition of p-hydroxylation by CO, SKF 525-A, and metyrapone was demonstrated. It was concluded that a form of cytochrome P-450 catalyzes the reaction. The velocity of N-demethylation in human liver did not show saturation even at 500 microM substrate concentration. The p-hydroxylation, however, followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Km, determined in five different livers, ranged from 59 to 143 microM. The linearity in Eadie-Hofstee plots was consistent with the involvement of a single catalytic site.",

Quantitative determinations of 4-OH-M in urine of 10 volunteers showed that 43 +/- 7% (SD) of a single oral dose of 100 mg of mephenytoin were eliminated as the glucuronide of this metabolite. Urinary elimination of the demethylated metabolite, 5-ethyl-5-phenylhydantoin (Nirvanol), was low (1% of the dose per 24 hr) emphasizing the importance of 4-OH-M as the major metabolite after a single oral dose of mephenytoin. Other products of mephenytoin hydroxylation (2-OH-M, E-OH-M, or aliphatically hydroxylated 2-OH-ethyl-M) were not detectable under the conditions selected (less than 1 umol/24 hr).",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Decontamination: administer activated charcoal orally if conditions are appropriate. Gastric lavage is not necessary after small to moderate ingestions if activated charcoal can be given promptly.

Mephenytoin (100 mg) was coadministered with debrisoquin (10 mg) orally and urine was collected for 8 hours. Mephenytoin metabolism was tested according to three measures: the amount of 4-hydroxymephenytoin, the S/R enantiomeric ratio, and the presence of a polar, acid-labile metabolite in urine collected for 8 hours after the dose. The S/R ratio and the presence of the acid-labile metabolite were determined in the urine of 16 patients who had low amounts of 4-hydroxymephenytoin (log hydroxylation index > or = 1). On examination of these three parameters of oxidation status, nine subjects were found to be poor metabolizers of mephenytoin by all three parameters. Thus 4.6% (95% confidence interval of 1.6% to 7.6%) of Jordanian subjects studied were poor metabolizers of mephenytoin. According to the Hardy-Weinberg Law, the frequency of the recessive autosomal gene controlling the poor metabolizer status of mephenytoin was predicted to be 0.215% (95% confidence interval of 0.146% to 0.283%). These results are on the same order of magnitude as those determined in European white populations and constitute the first report in Arab populations.",

Mean (+/- S.E.) maternal serum concentrations of PHT, MPH, and ETH 1 hr after dosing on gestational day 18 were 16.0 +/- 3.3, 10.7 +/- 3.0, and 65.2 +/- 10.45, respectively, and free fractions were 16%, 18%, and 11% respectively. The free fraction for PHT is similar, but was lower for both MPH and ETH than that seen in humans. Preweaning mortality for PHT, MPH, ETH, HYD, and controls was 25%, 6.3%, 12.5%, 2.0% and 0.8%, respectively. The MPH and ETH exposed animals weighed approximately 6.6% less than controls throughout the study; the other groups did not differ significantly. PHT offspring showed incr early locomotor activity. Only PHT exposed animals (27%) exhibited abnormal circling behavior after weaning. PHT-circlers accounted for higher levels of activity in an open field test and for longer straight channel swimming times. PHT-circlers and noncirclers differed from one another and controls on performance of a complex (Cincinnati) maze and on the development of the air-righting reflex. Offspring prenatally exposed to MPH showed an early delay in air-righting. ETH and HYD offspring were not consistently different from controls in behavior. The data suggest the following ordinal relationship among the drugs for behavioral teratogenesis: PHT much greater than MPH greater than ETH congruent to HYD congruent to CON. The effects of PHT are consistent with previous findings. Data on the other drugs suggest that other hydantoins do not possess the behavioral teratogenic efficacy of PHT and that PHT may be unique in its effects on CNS development.",

Also, polymorphic oxidation, which is present in about 2 to 5% of the Caucasian population, has been demonstrated by an impaired ability to 4-hydroxylate this anticonvulsant. In order to determine the consequences of such metabolism, the plasma concentration/time profiles of the enantiomers of mephenytoin and its N-demethylated metabolite, phenylethylhydantoin (PEH), were investigated after a single p.o. dose of racemic mephenytoin in normal subjects with different metabolizing ability for mephenytoin [extensive metabolizer (EM) vs. poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes]. In the EM subjects, the disposition of S- and R-mephenytoin was markedly different with a 100- to 200-fold difference in mean oral clearance (4.7 vs. 0.027 liters/min) and a 30- to 40-fold difference in elimination half-life (2.1 vs. 76 hr). In these same subjects, R-PEH concentrations significantly accumulated over several days and then very slowly declined with an apparent half-life of about 200 hr. Plasma levels of S-PEH were essentially negligible. In contrast, the stereoselective elimination of mephenytoin was reduced markedly in subjects of the PM phenotype, with the disposition of the S-enantiomer being the same as that for R-mephenytoin, which in turn was similar to that observed for this enantiomer in EMs. Almost comparable plasma levels of S- and R-PEH were also present in PMs. Only a small amount (less than 5%) of unchanged mephenytoin was excreted in the urine regardless of phenotype.",

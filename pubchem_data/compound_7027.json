When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A two-step continuous crystallization is said to result in increased productivity per unit volume under conditions that are favorable in terms of energy consumption. In the first step, a crystalline suspension (3 to 10 % crystalline material) is produced in a supersaturated gluconic acid solution held at 65 to 75 \u00b0C. The second step involves controlled cooling to 40 to 45 \u00b0C, followed by a period of crystal maturation at constant temperature. A portion of the resulting crystalline suspension is then recycled to the first step. ... The 1,5-lactone may also be obtained from an aqueous gluconic acid solution by dehydration involving azeotropic distillation with alcohols, followed by crystallization from the alcohol-containing residue. Crystallization above 70 \u00b0C leads to the 1,4-lactone.",

The results of this study showed that both gluconolactone and benzoyl peroxide had a significant effect in improving patients' acne by reducing the number of lesions (inflamed and non-inflamed). Furthermore, fewer side-effects were experienced by patients treated with gluconolactone when compared with benzoyl peroxide",

Gluconolactone is also used as a food additive and in some cosmetics as a sunscreen.  The biological oxidation of glucose also leads to the formation of gluconolactone.  If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.8X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates gluconolactone will exist solely in the particulate-phase. Particulate-phase gluconolactone is removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, gluconolactone is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Gluconolactone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. A screening study indicates that gluconolactone may be susceptible to biodegradation under aerobic conditions, and under anaerobic conditions the yeast Saccharomyces bulderi rapidly ferments gluconolactone to ethanol and carbon dioxide. If released into water, gluconolactone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Hydrolysis is expected to be the dominant environmental fate process for gluconolactone in water. The hydrolysis half-lives of gluconolactone at pH 6.6 and 4 are 10 minutes and 60 minutes, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to gluconolactone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to this compound by ingestion of foods containing gluconolactone and dermal contact with cosmetic products that use this compound as a sunscreen. (SRC)",

Gluconolactone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces given an estimated vapor pressure of 2.8X10-9 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5). A screening study indicates that gluconolactone may be susceptible to biodegradation under aerobic conditions(6), and under anaerobic conditions the yeast Saccharomyces bulderi rapidly ferments gluconolactone to ethanol and carbon dioxide(7), suggesting that biodegradation may occur in soil(SRC). Hydrolysis of gluconolactone to gluconic acid should occur rapidly in moist soils given a hydrolysis half-life of about 10 minutes at pH 6.6 and 60 minutes at pH 4(6).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important environmental fate process(3), based upon an estimated Henry's law constant of 1.4X10-9 atm cu m/mol(SRC), derived from a structure estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -1.98(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Limited data suggest that biodegradation may occur in aquatic environments(8,9); however, hydrolysis is expected to be the dominant environmental fate process in water(SRC). Hydrolysis of gluconolactone to gluconic acid occurs rapidly, with a half-life of about 10 minutes at pH 6.6 and 60 minutes at pH 4(9).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

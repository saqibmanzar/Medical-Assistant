Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

LD50s for hydrogen cyanide have been estimated to be 1.1 mg/kg for IV administration and 100 mg/kg after skin exposure. ... Cyanide is unique among military chemical agents because it is detoxified at a rate that is of practical importance, about 17 ug/kg x min.

Conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate is enhanced when cyanide poisoning is treated by intravenous administration of a sulfur donor ... . The sulfur donor must have a sulfane sulfur, a sulfur bonded to another sulfur (e.g., sodium thiosulfate). During conversion by rhodanese, a sulfur atom is transferred from the donor to the enzyme, forming a persulfide intermediate. The persulfide sulfur is then transferred from the enzyme to cyanide, yielding thiocyanate. Thiocyanate is then readily excreted in the urine as the major metabolite. Once thiocyanate is formed, it is not converted back to cyanide. /Cyanide/",

Cyanide is metabolized in mammalian systems by one major route and several minor routes. The major route of metabolism for hydrogen cyanide and cyanides is detoxification in the liver by the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese, which catalyses the transfer of the sulfane sulfur of thiosulfate to the cyanide ion to form thiocyanate ... .  About 80% of cyanide is detoxified by this route. The rate-limiting step is the amount of thiosulfate. While rhodanese is present in the mitochondria of all tissues, the species and tissue distributions of rhodanese are highly variable. In general, the highest concentrations of rhodanese are found in the liver, kidney, brain, and muscle, but the supply of thiosulfate is limited. Rhodanese is present in rat nasal mucosal tissues, particularly in the olfactory region, at a 7-fold higher concentration (on a per milligram of mitochondrial protein basis) than in the liver. Dogs have a lower overall activity of rhodanese than monkeys, rats, and rabbits. A number of other sulfur transferases can also metabolize cyanide, and albumin, which carries elemental sulfur in the body in the sulfane form, can assist in the catalysis of cyanide to thiocyanate as well. Cyanide and thiocyanate can also be metabolized by several minor routes, including the combination of cyanide with hydroxycobalamin (vitamin B12a) to yield cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) and the non-enzymatic combination of cyanide with cystine, forming 2-iminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid, which appears to be excreted without further change. /Cyanide/",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

A two-step process has been proposed: cyanide as hydrogen cyanide first penetrates a protein crevice of cytochrome c oxidase and binds to the protein. Hydrogen cyanide then binds to the trivalent iron ion of the enzyme, forming a relatively stable (but reversible) coordination complex. One mole of hydrogen cyanide is bound to one mole of cytochrome c oxidase. As a result, the enzyme becomes unable to catalyze the reactions in which electrons would be transferred from reduced cytochrome to oxygen. Cellular oxygen utilization is thus impaired, with resultant reduction in or cessation of aerobic metabolism. Glucose catabolism then shifts from the aerobic pathway to anaerobic metabolism including the pentose phosphate pathway, resulting in increased blood glucose, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH) levels, and a decrease in the adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) ratio. /Some investigators/ suggest that it is the binding of cyanide to oxidized CuB, the copper ion that is part of the dioxygen binding-site that leads to the inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase. The inhibition of oxygen use by cells (termed histoxic hypoxia) causes oxygen tensions to rise in peripheral tissues. This results in a decrease in the unloading gradient for oxyhemoglobin; thus, oxyhemoglobin is carried in the venous blood. Inhibition of oxygen utilization is thought to occur rapidly after cyanide exposure. ...  In addition to binding to cytochrome c oxidase, cyanide also binds to catalase, peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and succinic dehydrogenase. These reactions may also contribute to the classic signs of cyanide toxicity. ...",

Exposure to hydrogen cyanide (AC) can be rapidly fatal. It has whole-body (systemic) effects, particularly affecting those organ systems most sensitive to low oxygen levels: the central nervous system (brain), the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels), and the pulmonary system (lungs). Hydrogen cyanide (AC) is a chemical warfare agent (military designation, AC). It is used commercially for fumigation, electroplating, mining, chemical synthesis, and the production of synthetic fibers, plastics, dyes, and pesticides. Hydrogen cyanide (AC) gas has a distinctive bitter almond odor (others describe a musty \u201cold sneakers smell\u201d), but a large proportion of people cannot detect it; the odor does not provide adequate warning of hazardous concentrations. It also has a bitter burning taste and is often used as a solution in water.",

The second method involves direct synthesis by the reaction of methane and ammonia with air over platinum catalysts, otherwise known as the Andrussow process. Another less common manufacturing method, the Shawinigan process, is being applied in Spain and Australia that involves the reaction of ammonia with propane or butane in a fluidized bed of coke particles. Other methods of production include the dehydration of formamide and the reaction of sodium carbonate with coke-oven gas.",

However, the oral cavity is a dominant production site for exhaled HCN and this contribution can mask the HCN generated in the lung. It is thus important to understand the sources of HCN production in the oral cavity. By screening of oral anaerobes for HCN production, we observed that the genus of Porphyromonas, Prevotella and Fusobacterium generated low levels of HCN in vitro. This is the first study to show that oral anaerobes are capable of producing HCN in vitro. Further investigations were conducted on the species of P. gingivalis and we successfully detected HCN production (0.9-10.9 ppb) in the headspace of three P. gingivalis reference strains (ATCC 33277, W50 and OMG 434) and one clinical isolate. From P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and W50, a strong correlation between HCN and CO2 concentrations (rs=0.89, p<0.001) was observed, indicating that the HCN production of P. gingivalis might be connected with the bacterial metabolic activity. These results indicate that our setup could be widely applied to the screening of in vitro HCN production by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.",

There are several methods of ATCA determination; however, they are restricted to extraction on mixed mode cation exchange sorbents. To date, there has been no reliable method of ATCA determination in whole blood, the most frequently used material in forensic analysis. This novel method for ATCA determination in post mortem specimen includes protein precipitation, and derivatization of interfering compounds and their later extraction with ethyl acetate. ATCA was quantitatively analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with positive electrospray ionization detection using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column. The method satisfied all validation criteria and was tested on the real samples with satisfactory results. Therefore, this analytical approach has been proven to be a tool for measuring endogenous levels of ATCA in post mortem specimens. To conclude, a novel, accurate and sensitive method of ATCA determination in post mortem blood was developed. The establishment of the method provides new possibilities in the field of forensic science.",

The ability to smell cyanide is a genetically determined trait, absent in 20% to 40% of the population. Two common scenarios for generation of HCN include the accidental mixing of acid and cyanide solutions in electroplating baths and the accidental pouring of cyanide waste solutions into acid waste containers or into other waste solutions with pHs below 10.5-11. What is even less recognized by workers is the potential for generation of large quantities of HCN simply from mixing water-soluble cyanide salts with water, e.g. showering in clothes contaminated with cyanides. Short exposures of large areas of skin to solid cyanide salts or their aqueous solutions can result in dermal absorption of lethal quantities of cyanide. [Sullivan, p.705]  Inhaling 600 to 700 ppm HCN for 5 min. or 200 ppm for 30 min. may be fatal.  In smoke inhalation victims, hypoxia from carbon monoxide is initially indistinguishable from that due to cyanide.

AEGLs are used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures.  AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Weakness, headache, vertigo (dizziness), agitation, giddiness, salivation, nausea, and vomiting, may be followed by combative behavior, convulsions, paralysis, protruding eyeballs, dilated and unreactive pupils, and coma. Tachypnea (rapid, shallow respirations) or hyperpnea (rapid, deep respirations) may be followed by respiratory depression. Lung hemorrhage and pulmonary edema may also occur. Hydrocyanic acid is may be irritating to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Lacrimation (tearing) and a burning sensation of the mouth and throat are common.",

The liquid acid is relatively uncorrosive. Materials compatible with HCN at normal temperatures are stainless steel, Hastelloy, and Monel. To prevent polymerization, stabilizing agents, such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic or acetic acid, and sulfur dioxide are used. The type and quantity of stabilizer (usually <0.5%) depend on storage capacity, temperature, and residence time in a container. A combination of H2SO4 and SO2 prevents the decomposition of HCN in the liquid and vapor phases. Larger quantities of hydrogen cyanide are stored at a maximum temperature of 5 \u00b0C and must be permanently recirculated. Additionally, the color of the liquid is monitored and should not exceed APHA 20. To keep the concentration of gas below the danger level, good ventilation of buildings in which HCN is stored and handled is of primary importance.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Ztg., 1926, 50, p. 761, 781]. In the absence of a stabilizer (such as phosphoric acid), may undergo explosively rapid spontaneous (autocatalytic) polymerization leading to a fire. The reaction is autocatalytic because of ammonia formation. [Bond, J., Loss Prev. Bull., 1991, 101, p.3]. Dissolves in water to give weakly acidic solutions. Reacts violently with acetaldehyde. During the preparation of imidoester hydrochlorides, hydrogen chloride was rapidly passed over alcoholic hydrogen cyanide. An explosion ensued, even with cooling of the process [J. Org. Chem., 1955, 20, 1573].",

The AC or CK vapor initially on the ground will quickly expand outward and up. The high volatility will, within a very short time, cause the vapor to lose its lethal concentration near the point of delivery. Within a short period of time, it will pose little threat downwind from the release point. It is because of this quick dissipation of the vapor that they agents are called nonpersistent.",

Blood from seventy-eight of the victims was screened for carboxyhemoglobin at the Institute for Forensic Sciences in Puerto Rico and was then sent to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland, for analysis of carboxyhemoglobin and cyanide concentrations. The blood data indicated that carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, singly or combined, were probably not responsible for the majority of the deaths that occurred in the badly burned victims. On the other hand, the significantly higher carboxyhemoglobin in the nonburned victims indicated that carbon monoxide alone or combined with hydrogen cyanide probably played a major role in the cause of their deaths.",

Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) were quantified in victims blood to elucidate the cause of the death. Saturation of COHb ranged between 4 and 18%, and HCN 2.0 to 7.2 mg/L. These latter values were higher than the lethal levels reported in literature. Other toxic components routinely measured (ethanol, methanol, aldehydes and other volatile compounds) gave negative results on the 35 cases. Neither drugs of abuse nor psychotropics were detected. Statistical ... analysis was applied to find differences between HCN and COHb concentrations. Saturation of COHb and HCN in blood were not independent variables (chi sq=8.25). Moreover, the ratio COHb/HCN was constant (0.47+/-0.04). In order to evaluate the contribution of each toxic to the diagnosis, a lethal index was defined for each toxic (LICO and LIHCN). The most probable cause of death could be inferred by a suitable plot of both indexes. The results indicated that death in the 35 fire victims was probably caused by HCN, generated during the extensive polyurethane decomposition provoked by a rapid increase of temperature.",

Symptoms and signs were identical to those in the first group but appeared 0.5 hr after ingestion and were more severe. Thirteen children recovered, 2 died shortly after admission and a third child died 2 hr later. Apricot kernals contain a cyanogenic substance called amygdalin, which after hydrolysis, liberates hydrocyanic acid. This activation usually only occurs after ingestion. In the second episode hydrolysis probably occurred during the preparation of the sweets, explaining the short interval between ingestion and appearance of the signs of poisoning.",

Some newspapers in Nigeria have reported deaths associated with cassava meal consumption. The papers looked into the toxic factors in cassava, their causes, the resultant effects on humans, and the reasons why cassava diets became popular in Nigeria. Suggestions were made on how to process cassava to make it safe for human consumption. The reported deaths may have occurred due to improper processing. This may have left traces of hydrogen cyanide in the products and on consumption produced death.",

Hydrogen cyanide is used primarily in the production of substances such as adiponitrile, methyl methacrylate, chelating agents, cyanuric chloride, methionine and its hydroxylated analogues, and sodium and potassium cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide is also used as a fumigant in ships, railroad cars, large buildings, grain silos, and flour mills, as well as in the fumigation of peas and seeds in vacuum chambers. Hydrogen cyanide is formed during the incomplete combustion of nitrogen-containing polymers, such as certain plastics, polyurethanes, and wool. Hydrogen cyanide is also present in cigarette smoke. HUMAN STUDIES: The primary targets of cyanide toxicity in humans are the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems. The endocrine system is also a potential target for long term toxicity, as a function of continued exposure to thiocyanate, which prevents the uptake of iodine in the thyroid and acts as a goitrogenic agent. Sequelae after severe acute intoxications may include neuropsychiatric manifestations and Parkinson type disease. Cyanide from tobacco smoke has been implicated as a contributing factor in tobacco alcohol amblyopia. Long term exposure to lower concentrations of cyanide in occupational settings can result in a variety of symptoms related to central nervous system effects. Cyanides are weakly irritating to the skin and eye. ANIMAL STUDIES: The principal features of the toxicity profile for cyanide are its high acute toxicity by all routes of administration, with a very steep and rate-dependent dose effect curve, and chronic toxicity, probably mediated through the main metabolite and detoxification product, thiocyanate. The toxic effects of cyanide ion in humans and animals are generally similar and are believed to result from inactivation of cytochrome oxidase and inhibition of cellular respiration and consequent histotoxic anoxia. The primary targets of cyanide toxicity in animals are the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems. The endocrine system is also a potential target for long-term toxicity, as a function of continued exposure to thiocyanate, which prevents the uptake of iodine in the thyroid and acts as a goitrogenic agent. In a 13 week repeated-dose toxicity study in which cyanide was administered in drinking-water, there were no clinical signs associated with central nervous system effects or histopathological effects in the brain or thyroid of rats or mice. There were slight changes in the reproductive tract in male rats. The examination of neurotoxicity in this study was limited to clinical observation and optical microscopy in autopsy. The few available studies specifically intended to investigate neurotoxicity, while reporting adverse effects at exposure levels of 1.2 mg cyanide/kg body weight per day in rats and 0.48 mg cyanide/kg body weight per day in goats, suffer from weaknesses that preclude their quantitative assessment.  In relation to characterization of concentration-response for repeated-dose toxicity for inhalation (relevant principally to the occupational environment), in three separate studies in rats, there were no adverse systemic effects in rats exposed to acetone cyanohydrin, which is rapidly hydrolyzed to hydrogen cyanide at physiological pH, at concentrations up to 211 mg/cu m (corresponding to a concentration of 67 mg hydrogen cyanide/cu m). The steepness of the dose effect curve is illustrated by the observation of 30% mortality among rats exposed part of the day to 225 mg acetone cyanohydrin/cu m (71 mg hydrogen cyanide/cu m).  ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Adverse effects of exposure to the low concentrations of cyanide that are generally present in the general environment (<1 ug/cu m in ambient air; <10 ug/L in water) are unlikely.",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

Dermal decontamination is unnecessary if exposure has been only to vapor, but wet clothing should be removed and the underlying skin should be washed with soap and water or water alone if liquid on the skin is a possibility.

Administration of 100% oxygen has been found empirically to exert a beneficial effect and should be a part of general supportive care for every cyanide-poisoned patient. /Cyanides/",

Mild effects may be apparent at concentrations of 0.5-1.0 ug/mL, and concentrations of 2.5 ug/mL and higher are associated with coma, convulsions and death. 2. Acidosis. Metabolic acidosis with a high concentration of lactic acid (lactic acidosis) or a metabolic acidosis with an unexplained high anion gap (if the means to measure lactic acid are not available) may be present. Because oxygen cannot be utilized, anaerobic metabolism with the production of lactic acid replaces aerobic metabolism. Lactic acidosis, however, may reflect other disease states and is not specific for cyanide poisoning. 3. Oxygen content of venous blood greater than normal. This also is a result of poisoning of the intramitochondrial respiratory chain and the resulting failure of cells to extract oxygen from arterial blood. This finding is also not specific for cyanide poisoning. /Cyanides/",

Most clinical effects are of CNS origin and are nonspecific. Approximately 15 seconds after inhalation of a high concentration of cyanide, there is a transient hyperpnea, followed within in 15 to 30 seconds by the onset of convulsions. Respiratory activity stops two to three minutes later, and cardiac activity ceases several minutes later still, or approximately six to eight minutes after exposure. The onset and progression of signs and symptoms after ingestion of cyanide or after inhalation of a lower concentration of vapor are slower. The first effects may not occur until several minutes after exposure, and the time course of these effects depends on the amount absorbed and the rate of absorption. The initial transient hyperpnea may be followed by feelings of anxiety or apprehension, agitation, vertigo, a feeling of weakness, nausea with or without vomiting, and muscular trembling. Later, consciousness is lost, respiration decreases in rate and depth, and convulsions, apnea, and cardiac dysrhythmias and standstill follow. Because this cascade of events is prolonged, diagnosis and successful treatment are possible. /Cyanide/",

In an extensive series of inhalation experiments, in which different species of animals were exposed to usually 5 to 8 different concentrations of hydrogen cyanide and followed until death, he showed that the lethal time (time for 50% of animals to die at 1000 mg/cu m) was 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.5 min for dogs, mice, cats, rabbits, rats, guinea-pigs, goats, and monkeys. Extrapolation to zero mortality gave the following maximal non-lethal concentrations to dogs, rats, mice, rabbits, monkeys, cats, goats, and guinea-pigs: 100, 100, 140, 180, 180, 180, 240, and 400 mg/cu m. There was thus a rough inverse relationship between sensitivity to hydrogen cyanide and body size, dogs being a notable exception.",

Also, the incapacitating effects of fire atmospheres result from exposure to a mixture of toxic products so that the contribution from each component is difficult to determine. The mechanisms of incapacitation in monkeys exposed to the pyrolysis products of polyacrylonitrile were compared to those resulting from low level hydrogen cyanide gas exposures. The physiological effects of the polyacrylonitrile atmospheres were almost identical to those of hydrogen cyanide gas alone. They consisted of hyperventilation, followed by loss of consciousness after 1-5 min, bradycardia with arrhythmias and T-wave abnormalities, and were followed by a rapid recovery after exposure. Hydrogen cyanide is considered to be the major toxic product formed by the pyrolysis of polyacrylonitrile. It is suggested that hydrogen cyanide may produce rapid incapacitation at low blood levels of cyanide in fires.",

An initial exposure was associated with hypoactivity, rapid shallow breathing, anoxia/hypoxia signs, and convulsions, followed by chromorhinorrhea, convulsions and varied signs of labored breathing. Survivors of 2 exposures exhibited rapid breathing and reduced mean bodyweight with a solitary male rat exhibiting arching of the back. Signs of toxicity associated with a third exposure were limited to hypoactivity and quick shallow breathing; mean daily bodyweight gains were restored. Mortality occurred either during or following an initial exposure in 1 and 2 males, respectively. Necropsy of these study decedents revealed cyanosis of the extremities, hemorrhagic lungs, lung and tracheal edema, blanching of the liver, chromorhinorrhea, urine-filled bladder, gaseous distention of the gastro-intestinal tract, and a solitary incidence of blood engorgement of the heart and surrounding vasculature. On terminal necropsy of study survivors, females exhibited slight to moderate hemorrhage (3/5) and grey discoloration (2/5) of the lung.",

In more-resistant species, such as domestic chickens, signs of toxicosis began 10 min after exposure. At higher doses, breathing in all species tested became increasingly deep and labored, followed by gasping and shallow intermittent breathing. Death usually followed in 15-30 min, although birds alive at 60 min frequently recovered. The rapid recovery of some birds exposed to cyanide may be due to the rapid metabolism of cyanide to thiocyanate and its subsequent excretion. Species sensitivity to cyanide was not related to body size but seemed to be associated with diet. Birds that feed predominantly on flesh, such as vultures, kestrels, and owls, were more sensitive to cyanide than were species that feed mainly on plant material--with the possible exception of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)--as judged by acute oral LD50 values. /Cyanide/",

Median lethal threshold concentrations and 96-hr LC50's were established by flow-through type biassays. Acute toxicity varied from 57 ug/L for juvenile rainbow trout to 191 ug/L for field stocks of juvenile fathead minnows. Juvenile fish were more sensitive at lower temperatures and at oxygen levels below 5 mg/L. For most species juveniles were most sensitive and eggs more resistant. /Acid/",

Its former use as an insecticidal fumigant, rodenticide and illegal use as a chemical warfare agent resulted in its direct release to the environment. Hydrogen cyanide is present in human blood and some plants. Small concentrations are also found in the stratosphere and atmosphere. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 742 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates hydrogen cyanide will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase hydrogen cyanide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 530 days. Hydrogen cyanide does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, hydrogen cyanide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 15. The pKa of hydrogen cyanide is 9.2, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.33X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Hydrogen cyanide may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Hydrogen cyanide can be biodegraded by acclimated microbial cultures and sludges, but is usually toxic at high concentrations to unacclimated microbial systems, indicating that biodegradation may not be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, hydrogen cyanide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hrs and 3 days, respectively.  An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound contains lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to hydrogen cyanide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hydrogen cyanide is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to hydrogen cyanide via inhalation of cigarette smoke, ingestion of specific foods. (SRC)",

The pKa of hydrogen cyanide is 9.2(4), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). By analogy to the fate of cyanides in water, it is predicted that the fate in soil would be pH dependent. Cyanide may occur in the form of hydrogen cyanide, alkali metal salts, or immobile metallocyanide complexes. At soil surfaces with pH <9.2, it is expected that volatilization of hydrogen cyanide would be an important loss mechanism for cyanides. In subsurface soil, cyanide present at low concentrations would probably biodegrade(6). Volatilization of hydrogen cyanide from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.33X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(7). Hydrogen cyanide is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 742 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(8). Hydrogen cyanide can be biodegraded by acclimated microbial cultures and sludges, but is usually toxic at high concentrations to unacclimated microbial systems(9), indicating that biodegradation may not be an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.33X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hrs and 3 days, respectively(SRC). A pKa of 9.2(6) indicates hydrogen cyanide will exist partially in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Hydrogen cyanide can be biodegraded by acclimated microbial cultures and sludges, but is usually toxic at high concentrations to unacclimated microbial systems(8), indicating that biodegradation may not be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Based on a reaction rate constant of 3X10-14 cu m/(molecules-sec) at 25 \u00b0C, and assuming an ambient hydroxyl radical concentration of 8X10+5 molecules/cu m, the half-life for the reaction of hydrogen cyanide vapor with hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere is approximately 2 years. Hydrogen cyanide very resistant to direct photolysis at environmental wavelengths (>290 nm). The relatively slow rate of degradation of hydrogen cyanide suggests that this compound has the potential to be transported over long distances before being removed by physical or chemical processes. Since hydrogen cyanide is miscible in water, it appears that wet deposition may be an important fate process. Metal cyanide particles are expected to be removed from air by both wet and dry deposition(1).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

A pKa of 9.2(2) indicates hydrogen cyanide will exist partially in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9(SRC). At pH <9.2, most of the free cyanide should exist as hydrogen cyanide, a volatile form of cyanide. Wide variations in the rate of volatilization are expected since this process is affected by a number of parameters including temperature, pH, wind speed, and cyanide concentration(1). The Henry's Law constant for the neutral species is 1.33X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(3). This Henry's Law constant indicates that hydrogen cyanide is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(4). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(4) is estimated as 5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(4) is estimated as 3 days(SRC). Hydrogen cyanide's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Hydrogen cyanide is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 742 mm Hg(5).",

The products were selected for the type of fire-resistant finishes used. Samples were heated at 500 and 700 degrees C in air, in accordance with the procedures of DIN 53446. Hydrogen cyanide was detected in the smoke gases. The changes in composition of the smoke gases with time and heavy components in the smoke were examined qualitatively. Particulates and liquids in the smoke were trapped in an ice trap for analysis. The toxicity of the smoke and smoke gases to rats was also measured. The carbon monoxide binding in rat blood was detected via carboxyhemoglobin measurement. Frequently, the fireproofing additives gave rise to a higher heat of combustion, but even at lower heats the smoke contained toxic gases. ... In a room lethal amounts of hydrogen cyanide are formed from modacrylics and Flamentin-flameproof cotton at the lower temp and from wool at the higher temp.",

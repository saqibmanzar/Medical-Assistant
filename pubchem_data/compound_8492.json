When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The higher of the two concentrations appeared to induce a statistically significant loss of cellular viability (p less than 0.01 compared to control), judged by Trypan Blue staining, after 3 hours of incubation with these substances means = 58, SD = 7%; and means = SD = 7%; for 4C2NA and 2C4NA, respectively). Furthermore, both chloronitroanilines produced an hepatocellular and microsomal damage demonstrated by conspicuous changes in LDH and G-6-Pase activities (p < 0.01). The exposure to 2 mM of both 4C2NA and/or 2C4NA produced a marked depletion of the intracellular pool of GSH after 3 hours (13 mM/10+6 and 10 mM/10+6 cells, respectively; p < 0.01). ...",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.8X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 days. 2-Chloro-4-nitroaniline does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc values of 350. However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Chloro-4-nitroaniline is regarded as non-biodegradable in the aquatic environment as well as in communal and industrial sewage treatment plants; therefore, biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. 2-Chloro-4-nitroaniline showed only a 12% loss over 8 days in a water-based medium due to abiotic factors. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(4). The stability of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline in standardized aqueous medium was monitored at room temperature; a 12% loss of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline was noted over a 8 day period due to either volatilization or abiotic transformation of this compound(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 9(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 2-Chloro-4-nitroaniline is regarded as non-biodegradable in the aquatic environment as well as in communal and industrial sewage treatment plants(8); therefore, biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Using a modification of the Pitter test where the first step is an acclimation of a mixed microbial population to 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (at 25 mg/L) in a semi-continuous activated sludge system followed by a die-away test in closed flasks, only a slight amount of degradation occurred. The initial inoculum was a 1:1 mixture of activated sludge from a domestic sewage plant and a solution containing organic material extracted from river mud. In the semi-continuous activated sludge system, 80% of the added 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline was still present after 17 days using both the mixed inoculum and an activated sewage sludge(2). 2-Chloro-4-nitroaniline is regarded as non-biodegradable in the aquatic environment as well as in communal and industrial sewage treatment plants(2).",

Degradation of (14)C-labeled niclosamide was studied in river and pond sediments (water:sediment ratio is 10-20:1) incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions over a 128 day period at 25 \u00b0C. Niclosamide degraded rapidly under these conditions with a half-life of 1.1 to 3.9 days in sediment; 1-amino-2-chloro-4-nitrobenzene, a hydrolytic product of niclosamide, was detected at concentrations of 1.8 ug (aerobic river sediment), 10.6 ug (aerobic pond sediment), 13.6 (anaerobic river sediment) and 25.6 ug (anaerobic pond sediment), following 32 days exposure to C-14 labelled niclosamide at a concentration of 1ug/mL in the overlying water; 2-chloro-4-nitraniline concentration in all samples was <1.0 ug after 93 days(2).",

The stability of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline in standardized aqueous medium was monitored at room temperature; a 12% loss of 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline was noted over an 8 day period due to either volatilization or abiotic transformation of this compound(2). 2-Chloro-4-nitroaniline is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). 2-Chloro-4-nitroaniline does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3,4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

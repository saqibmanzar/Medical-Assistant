Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The resultant increase in cAMP potentiates the inhibition of platelets by adenosine. The reduction in platelet activation is likely responsible for the decrease in thromboxane A2 generation seen with trapidil. The increase in cAMP is also likely responsible for the vasdilatory action of trapidil. The increase in protein kinase A activity due to increased cAMP activated L-type calcium channels in the heart leading to increased depolarization and a positive inotropic effect. Lastly, PKA inactivates Raf-1, an activator of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), which leads to a reduction in MAPK activation. This reduction in MAPK prevents mitogenesis due to PDGF binding to PDGF receptors.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

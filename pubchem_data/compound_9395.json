ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.",

Both processes have been proposed as the primary route of paraoxon detoxification in vivo. These experiments were designed to assess the relative contribution of each pathway to the disappearance of paraoxon in the rabbit. In vitro, paraoxon disappeared from whole rabbit blood with a half-life of 17.7 sec. Hydrolysis by paraoxonase accounted entirely for this disappearance and covalent binding contributed essentially nothing. In vivo, following an iv injection of 0.15 mg/kg paraoxon, serum paraoxonase hydrolyzed as much as 41% of the injected dose within the first 30 sec. Pretreatment of rabbits with an ip injection of tri-o-tolyl phosphate eliminated more than 95% of the paraoxon binding sites. However, pretreatment with tri-o-tolyl phosphate had no significant effect on the half-life or volume of distribution of paraoxon, indicating that covalent binding sites did not contribute significantly to the clearance of paraoxon from whole rabbits under these conditions. Hydrolysis of paraoxon by tissue paraoxonases, in addition to that catalyzed by paraoxonase in the blood, could account for its rapid metabolism. These findings demonstrate that paraoxonase has a major role in the disappearance of paraoxon in the rabbit. This suggests that susceptibility of people to chronic paraoxon poisoning may vary, according to their inherited level and type of serum paraoxonase.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

This metallic ion shows affinity for the thiophosphate group and catalyzes the hydrolysis of parathion but not paraoxon. A method for the simultaneous determination by measuring the p-nitrophenol formed after the addition of Pd(2+), whereas paraoxon can be measured directly by its reduction peak is proposed. In the determination of parathion acceptable errors were found as long as the parathion/paraoxon ratio was >1/45. In the determination of paraoxon, satisfactory results were obtained for paraoxon/parathion ratios >1/70.",

In the absence of this option and if the victim is conscious and not convulsing, it may be worth considering the risk of inducing vomiting, even though the induction of vomiting is not usually recommended outside of a physician's care. Ipecac syrup or salt water may be used to induce vomiting in such an emergency. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, assure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

Although this agent has been used as a deacetylase inhibitor in many studies, we discovered a mutagenic synergy with paraoxon and plant-activated m-phenylenediamine or with direct-acting 2-acetoxyacetylaminofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium cells. In the present study, mammalian-activated m-phenylenediamine, o-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, benzidine, 2,3-diaminophenazine or 2-aminofluorene, as well as plant-activated benzidine or 2-aminofluorene expressed an elevated mutagenic potency when assayed with S. typhimurium strain YG1024 in the presence of paraoxon. Under non-toxic conditions, paraoxon amplified the S. typhimurium mutant yield induced by these aromatic amines between 1.9-fold and 8.4-fold. Spectrophotometric analysis demonstrated that the rate of degradation of 2-acetoxyacetylaminofluorene was not significantly different in phosphate buffer with or without paraoxon or with S. typhimurium cytosol with or without paraoxon. Also paraoxon-mediated mutagenic synergy does not appear to be due to a direct reaction with aromatic amines. Mutagenic synergy between aromatic amines and OP oxon products may be a cause of concern because people are chronically exposed to environmental and dietary aromatic amines, and a significant segment of the US population tested positive for OP insecticide residues.",

Nausea is often the first symptom, followed by vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and excessive salivation (sialorrhea). Hypothermia has been reported in animals and at least once in man as an early sign. 2. Headache, giddiness, vertigo, and weakness. 3. Rhinorrhea and a sensation of tightness in the chest are common in inhalation exposures. 4. Blurring or dimness of vision, miosis (with fixed pinpoint pupils), tearing, ciliary muscle spasm, loss of accommodation, and ocular pain. None of these eye effects are diagnostically dependable except in primary ocular exposures. Indeed, mydriasis is sometimes seen, probably due to sympatho-adrenal discharge. 5. Bradycardia or tachycardia. Varying degrees of AV heart block are described, as well as atrial arrhythmias. 6. Loss of muscle coordination, slurring of speech, fasciculations and twitching of muscles (particularly of the tongue and eyelids), and generalized profound weakness. 7. Mental confusion, disorientation, and drowsiness. 8. Difficulty in breathing, excessive secretion of saliva and of respiratory tract mucus, oronasal frothing, cyanosis, pulmonary rales and rhonchi, and hypertension presumably due to asphyxia. 9. Random jerky movements, incontinence, convulsions, and coma. 10. Death primarily due to respiratory arrest arising from failure of the respiratory muscles, intense bronchoconstriction, or all three. /Parathion/",

Paraoxon was added to diluted sera 2 hr prior to incorporation into human complement reaction mixtures. Potencies to inhibit human complement and serum cholinesterase (ChE) were compared to potencies of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), a potent serine esterase inhibitor and a standard probe for human complement esterases. At 0.5 to 3.0 mM, paraoxon produced a dose-dependent inhibition of lysis. Mean IC50 for inhibition of ChE (a marker for occupational exposure to organophosphates and carbamates) by paraoxon was 4.1x10-8 M.

Recent studies indicate that these pesticides may have important effects on both the immune and hematopoietic systems. In the present study, human bone marrow cells were exposed in vitro to paraoxon and malaoxon (the primary metabolites of parathion and malathion). These compounds produced dose-dependent depression of colony formation by erythrocyte burst-forming units-erythroid and colony-forming units-erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage). Colony-forming units-erythroid colony formation was reduced 15%-57%, by both paraoxon and malaoxon, in the range of 10-8-10-5 M. No effects were seen at 10-9 and 10-10 M. Colony formation by burst-forming units-erythroid was reduced 15%-75%, at 10-9-10-5 M organophosphate, then returned to normal at 10-10 M organophosphate. In comparison to colony-forming units-erythroid, burst-forming units-erythroid appeared to be more sensitive to the suppressive action of organophosphates. Numbers of colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage colonies were reduced 16%-59% in the range of 10-9-10-5 M organophosphate, then returned to normal at 10-10 M organophosphates. Choline chloride added to marrow cultures (final concentration, 10 mM) enhanced colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage colony formation at all concentrations of paraoxon and malaoxon.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.1X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates paraoxon will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase paraoxon will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.9 hours. Particulate-phase paraoxon will be physically removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, paraoxon is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 48. Volatilization from moist and dry soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-10 atm-cu m/mole and this compound's vapor pressure, respectively. If released into water, paraoxon is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based on the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based on this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 19 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis may be an important process under environmental conditions based upon hydrolysis half-lives of 2.9, 144, and 173 days at pH values of 9.0, 7.4, and 5.0, respectively. Limited biodegradation data suggest biodegradation may be an important fate process in both soil and water; biodegradation products include p-nitrophenol and diethylphosphoric acid. In a Valencia orange grove treated with parathion, the greatest potential for worker exposure to paraoxon was on leaf and soil surfaces. Occupational exposure to paraoxon may occur through inhalation of spray mists and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where parathion is used. The general population may be exposed to paraoxon via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Experiments in an orchard treated with parathion led to the conclusion that parathion was converted rapidly to paraoxon in air, that the reaction took place largely in the vapor phase and was promoted by sunlight(3).",

Vapor-phase paraoxon is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.9 hours(3,SRC). Particulate-phase paraoxon may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

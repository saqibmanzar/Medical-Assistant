The releases of 7H-dibenzo(c,g)carbazole to the environment will result mainly from emissions and residues from combustion sources, such as cigarettes and coal power plants. 7H-Dibenzo(c,g)carbazole adsorbs very strongly to soil and if released on soil will remain in the surface layer of soil. It undergoes direct photolysis in water and would be expected to photolyze on the soil surfaces. It is resistant to biodegradation and would be expected to be persistent in the soil. If released in water, 7H-dibenzo(c,g)carbazole would adsorb strongly to sediment and undergo direct photolysis. A laboratory study suggests that 99% of 7H-dibenzo(c,g)carbazole entering natural waters will be adsorbed onto sediment and that the remaining 1% will be photochemically transformed. While the photolysis rate will vary with the time of day and season, the photolysis half-life will be less than a day. 7H-Dibenzo(c,g)carbazole would be expected to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. 7H-Dibenzo(c,g)carbazole should exist in the atmosphere as an aerosol and be removed by gravitational settling. 7H-Dibenzo(c,g)carbazole is readily photolyzed in water and may photolyze in atmospheric droplets and while adsorbed to particulate matter. The general population would be exposed to 7H-dibenzo(c,g)carbazole via inhalation of cigarette smoke and polluted air. Exposure would also occur from contact with dirt or objects where combustion emissions containing 7H-dibenzo(c,g)carbazole products settled. (SRC)",

Photolysis is expected to be the dominant process in clear waters and adsorption will be most important in turbid waters(1). Based on experimental photolysis rates at midday, the photolysis half-life of 7H-dibenzo(c,g)carbazole in winter is expected to be 1.0 hr in a model river, 0.5 hr in an oligotrophic lake, and 1.5 hr in a eutrophic lake or pond(1). While the photolysis rate will vary with the time of day, photolysis will be an important process with a half-life of less than a day(1). Since biodegradation appears to be unlikely, desorption from sediment may maintain a low concn of 7H-dibenzo(c,g)carbazole in a water body almost indefinitely(1). Between 50 and 82% of 7H-dibenzo(c,g)carbazole present in most natural waters would be adsorbed to suspended sediment(1). 7H-Dibenzo(c,g)carbazole would be expected to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC).",

It absorbs UV radiation to 390 nm, having a long wavelength molar extinction coefficient of 10 L/mol-cm at 390 nm and a peak extinction coefficient of 13,000 L/mol-sec at 366 nm(1,2). It therefore may undergo direct photolysis. Its rate constant when illuminated at 366 nm in pure water was 1.52X10-3/sec(1). Its rate constant in pure water at noon in mid January was measured to be 5.18X10-4/sec (half-life 0.37 hr)(1,2). Its calculated photolysis half-life in pure water at noon for midwinter and mid-summer are approximately 0.85 and 0.35 hr, respectively(1). The presence of humic material or other substances in the water can attenuate the light or sensitize the phototransformation(3). When illuminated at 366 nm, its rate constants in Lake Tahoe water, Coyote Creek water, and Searville Pond water are 1.42X10-3/sec, 1.17X10-3/sec, and 1.80X10-3/sec, respectively, which are not very different from that in pure water(1).

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

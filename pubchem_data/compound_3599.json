PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

This agent also inhibits the anti-apoptotic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and modulates the balance between the MAPK and pro-apoptotic stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathways, thereby inducing apoptosis.  As an immunomodulator, miltefosine stimulates T-cells, macrophages and the expression of interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon gamma (INF-gamma).

The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Several potential antileishmanial mechanisms of action have been proposed, however no mechanism has been identified definitely. Within the mitochondria, miltefosine inhibits cytochrome-c oxidase leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis-like cell death. Antineoplastic mechanisms of action are related to antileishmanial targets and include inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and inhibition of Akt (also known as protein kinase B), which is a crucial protein within the PI3K/Akt/mTOR intracellular signalling pathway involved in regulating the cell cycle. Animal studies also suggest it may be effective against Trypanosome cruzi (the organism responsible for Chagas' disease), metronidazole-resistant strains of Trichonomas vaginalis, and it may have broad-spectrum anti-fungal activity.",

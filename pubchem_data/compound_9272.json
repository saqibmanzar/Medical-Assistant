When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Nausea is often the first symptom, followed by vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and excessive salivation (sialorrhea). Hypothermia has been reported in animals and at least once in man as an early sign. 2. Headache, giddiness, vertigo, and weakness. 3. Rhinorrhea and a sensation of tightness in the chest are common in inhalation exposures. 4. Blurring or dimness of vision, miosis (with fixed pinpoint pupils), tearing, ciliary muscle spasm, loss of accommodation, and ocular pain. None of these ocular effects are diagnostically dependable except in primary ocular exposures. Indeed, mydriasis is sometimes seen, probably due to sympatho-adrenal discharge. 5. Bradycardia or tachycardia. Varying degrees of AV heart block are described, as well as atrial arrhythmias. 6. Loss of muscle coordination, slurring of speech, fasciculations and twitching of muscles (particularly of the tongue and eyelids), and generalized profound weakness. 7. Mental confusion, disorientation, and drowsiness. 8. Difficulty in breathing, excessive secretion of saliva and of respiratory tract mucus, oronasal frothing, cyanosis, pulmonary rales and rhonchi, and hypertension presumably due to asphyxia. 9. Random jerky movements, incontinence, convulsions and coma. 10. Death primarily due to respiratory arrest arising from failure of the respiratory muscles, intense bronchoconstriction, or all three. /Parathion/",

If released to the atmosphere, it is expected to exist predominantly in the vapor phase. Rapid destruction by the reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals is expected to occur; the half-life for this process can be estimated at 4.3 hr. Wet deposition may also occur. If released to soil, limited data suggests that microbial degradation under aerobic conditions may occur. The half-life of 10-100 ppm thionazin in soil is on the order of 2-6 weeks which encompasses the removal processes leaching, biodegradation and hydrolysis. Higher concentrations of thionazin are removed at a slower rate. It appears to be removed more rapidly from alkaline soils than from acidic soils. Thionazin is expected to be highly mobile in soil. If released to water, thionazin is expected to undergo hydrolysis at an experimentally determined half-life at 25 \u00b0C of about 30 days at pH 7. Neither adsorption to sediment and suspended matter, nor bioconcentration in fish and aquatic organisms are expected to be significant fate processes. Occupational exposure to thionazin may occur by inhalation or dermal contact for those involved in the synthesis, formulation, or application of this pesticide. (SRC)",

The initial loss rate when thionazin was applied at 250 ppm was much slower, and traces of thionazin remained after 2 years(2). In a laboratory assay, 100 ppm thionazin lost 95% of its biological activity in 100 days(3). Thionazin was found in soil up to one year after its application to an acidic sandy loam field, but this compound was not detected after 10 weeks in alkaline clay soil(4).",

The author concluded that microbial degradation was indicated(1). Thionazin at these concentrations was not found to be permanently deleterious to the microbiota(1). Thionazin was listed as being degradable by microbiological means(2). The oxygen consumption of a sandy loam soil was found to increase significantly above the level of endogenous respiration when 5 or 10 ug/g of thionazin was added(3). When applied to a sultan silty loam, thionazin was found to undergo removal at rates faster than those observed in autoclaved samples; the half-lives for removal were 2 weeks of the soil sample and 9 weeks for the autoclaved sample (25 \u00b0C, pH 6.3, 20% water moisture)(4). Thionazin was most persistent at pH 5.5, and least persistent at pH 8.1, however, the author concluded that this was due to a change in the biological species responsible for degradation, and not from abiotic processes(4). The persistence of thionazin was also found to decrease with increasing moisture content of the soil(4). In a related study, thionazin underwent 68%, 23%, 31%, and 22% degradation in sultan silty loam, autoclaved sample, irradiated sample, and irradiated and autoclaved sample, respectively(5). The difference between the degradation in the autoclaved and irradiated sample was attributed to presence of a heat labile substance, which could not be identified(5).",

An experimental hydrolysis rate constant under basic conditions of 7.3 l/mole-hr (1,2) translates to a calculated half-life of approximately 40 and 4 days at pH 10 and pH 11, respectively(SRC). Thionazin was reported as having a half-life of 14 weeks in natural water at pH 6.8(3). Thionazin had a half-life of 50, 54, and 56 hr at 70 \u00b0C in water from the River Thames, the River Irthing, and in Brussels sprout extract, respectively(4). At 20 \u00b0C, the rates can be expected to be several hundred times slower(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

                                "Description": "In general, the occupational exposure limit (OEL) indicates the level of admissible exposure, for a length of time (usually 8 hours), to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health of a worker. The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of allyl glycidyl ether for female rats. One papillary adenoma of the respiratory epithelium was present in a female rat exposed to 5 ppm. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of allyl glycidyl ether for male B6C3F1 mice, based on the presence of three adenomas of the respiratory epithelium, dysplasia in four males, and focal basal cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium in seven males in the nasal passage of mice exposed to 10 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of allyl glycidyl ether for female mice, based on the presence of one adenoma of the respiratory epithelium and focal basal cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium in seven females exposed to 10 ppm.

Under the conditions of these 2 yr inhalation studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of allyl glycidyl ether for male Osborne-Mendel rats, based on the presence of one papillary adenoma of respiratory epithelial origin, one squamous cell carcinoma of the respiratory epithelial origin, and one poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of olfactory epithelial origin, all occurring in the nasal passage of males exposed to 10 ppb. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of allyl glycidyl ether for female rats. One papillary adenoma of the respiratory epithelium was present in a female rat exposed to 5 ppm. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of allyl glycidyl ether for male B6C3F1 mice based on the presence of three adenomas of the respiratory epithelium, dysplasia in four males, and focal basal cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium in seven males in the nasal passage of mice exposed to 10 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of allyl glycidyl ether for female mice, based on the presence of one adenoma of the respiratory epithelium and focal basal cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium in seven females exposed to 10 ppm. The sensitivity of the assay to detect potential carcinogenicity may have been reduced in male rats because of poor survival in all groups.",

These studies are designed and conducted to characterize and evaluate the toxicologic potential, including carcinogenic activity, of selected substances. Substances selected for NTP toxicology and carcinogenesis studies are chosen primarily on the basis of human exposure, level of production, and chemical structure. Substance selection is not an indicator of a substance's carcinogenic potential.",

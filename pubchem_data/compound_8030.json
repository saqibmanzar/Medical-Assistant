When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Based on an experimental vapor pressure of 79.7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C, thiophene is expected to exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase thiophene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl and nitrate radicals. The experimental atmospheric half-life of thiophene with hydroxyl radicals is about 40 hours and the half-life with nitrate radicals is about 2.5 nighttime hours. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.9X10-3 atm-cu m/mol. Thiophene is expected to have moderate mobility in soils based upon an estimated Koc value of 230. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is expected based upon the vapor pressure of this compound. Aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation are not important environmental fate processes for this compound. Using a standard BOD dilution technique and an activated sludge inoculum, a theoretical BOD of 0% was observed during a 2 week incubation period. No biodegradation was observed when thiophene was incubated in an anoxic aquifer slurry for a period of 3 months. In water, thiophene may adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its estimated Koc value. This compound is expected to volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 89 hours, respectively. The potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low based on experimental BCF values in the range of 2-7 measured for carp. The general population may be exposed to thiophene through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound and ingestion of food products containing or contaminated with thiophene. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

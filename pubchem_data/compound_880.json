PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The E2 isozyme had a K(m) for methylglyoxal of 8.6 uM, the lowest compared to 46 uM for E1 and 586 and 552 uM for the major and minor components of the E3 isozyme, respectively. Both components of the E3 isozyme showed substrate inhibition by methylglyoxal, with Ki values of 2.0 mM for the major component and 12 mM for the minor component at pH 9.0. Substrate inhibition by methylglyoxal was not observed with the E1 and E2 isozymes. Methylglyoxal strongly inhibited the glycolaldehyde activity of the E1 and E2 isozymes. Mixed-type models of inhibition were employed as an approach to calculate the inhibition constants, 44 and 10.6 microM for E1 and E2 isozymes, respectively.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

We first confirmed that MG caused apoptosis in Jurkat cells and that it was cell type dependent because it failed to induce apoptosis in MOLT-4, HeLa, or COS-7 cells. A caspase inhibitor, Z-DEVD-fmk, completely blocked MG-induced poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage and apoptosis, showing the critical role of caspase activation. Inhibition of JNK activity by a JNK inhibitor, curcumin, remarkably reduced MG-induced caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and apoptosis.",

A cross-sectional study was undertaken to determine whether methylglyoxal (MG) accumulates in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of chronic periodontitis patients. GCF samples were collected for 30 seconds each from three teeth with pocket depths greater than 3 mm (DD sites), from 14 chronic periodontitis patients. Control samples were taken from three healthy sites (DH sites) in the same patients, as well as from seven subjects who were periodontally healthy (HH sites). ... Mean pocket depths were 5.7 +/- 0.7, 2.7 +/- 0.6 and 2.7 +/- 0.5 mm (mean +/- SD) for the DD, DH and HH sites, respectively. Mean MG levels were found to be 208.7 +/- 241.7 and 142.9 +/- 235.7 pmol/site in the GCF from DD and DH sites, respectively (p=0.0023), but only 11.5 +/- 4.4 pmol/site for the HH sites",

The production of the glycolytic intermediate methylglyoxal (MG) was followed up in 7 diabetic patients treated for ketoacidosis during pretreatment and recovery phase. Blood samples for methylglyoxal analysis were collected upon patient arrival in emergency department (0 hr), and during ketoacidosis treatment between 12-24 hr and at 168 hr. The study also included 10 normoglycaemic healthy volunteers and 31 type 1 diabetic patients (control diabetes group). The methylglyoxal assay, based on methylglyoxal derivation with 1,2-diamino-4,5-dimethoxybenzene (DDB), was performed by HPLC, only assessing the level of free methylglyoxal. The baseline level of methylglyoxal recorded in normoglycemic healthy controls was 338 + 62 nmol/L versus 374 + 89 nmol/L in control diabetes group (p = 0.0407). A consistent feature of diabetic ketoacidosis before and during treatment was striking elevation of methylglyoxal as compared with control diabetes group (median test chi(2) = 14.6, df = 3, p = 0.0021). Friedman's ANOVA indicated differences (p = 0.04) among the three sampling times with a peak value (601 +/- 95 nmol/L) at 12-24 hr following therapy initiation. However, fasting treatment values at 168 hr were still significantly higher than the mean fasting methylglyoxal level in control diabetes group (p = 0.008). The study indicated that diabetic ketoacidosis results in an increase in methylglyoxal level.",

The morphofunctional effect of methylglyoxal on the common toad B. bufo embryo mitochondria ... isolated from embryos at the developmental stages of morula, neural plate and operculum complete and developing in the presence of 600 uM methylglyoxal /was examined/. The results show that exogenous methylglyoxal is highly toxic at mitochondrial level, where it produces proliferation, swelling and membrane derangement. As a consequence, mitochondria from treated embryos show decreased oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, as indicated by the significant reduction both of the respiratory control index values and of the embryonic ATP content.",

The effect of exogenous methylglyoxal on development and embryo viability during Bufo Bufo development and on the enzymes and cofactors involved in its detoxication process (glyoxalase I and II, reduced glutathione and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) /were studied/. The results show that exogenous methylglyoxal does not affect the enzymatic pattern until stage 20, while it induces a significant activity decrease of the tested enzymes at stage 25. On the contrary methylglyoxal positively influences the reduced glutathione concentration at all the considered stages. At morphological and histological levels methylglyoxal causes a strong retardation of cell division in the early stages, that results in various abnormalities in the late development. In conclusion, methylglyoxal enters the embryo and is antiproliferative and teratogenic.",

It is a partially oxidized compound obtained from the tropospheric oxidation of numerous hydrocarbons, both of biogenic and anthropogenic origin. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 27 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl glyoxal will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl glyoxal will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 30 hrs. Methyl glyoxal absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight; half-lives of 2-4 hours have been reported. If released to soil, methyl glyoxal is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.70X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl glyoxal may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, methyl glyoxal is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to methyl glyoxal may occur through inhalation of this compound at workplaces where methyl glyoxal is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methyl glyoxal via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of food and drinking water in addition to its endogenous formation in humans.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

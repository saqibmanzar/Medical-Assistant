ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

If released to the atmosphere, 1-chloroanthraquinone should exist in both the vapor phase and the particulate phase based on an estimated vapor pressure of 8.7X10-7 mm Hg. In the vapor phase, 1-chloroanthraquinone will react with hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 13 days. Particulate phase 1-chloroanthraquinone may be physically removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. An estimated Koc of 3500 suggests that 1-chloroanthraquinone will have only slight mobility in soil. It is not expected to volatilize from moist soil surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-9 atm-cu m/mol. Incomplete information is available regarding the biodegradation potential of 1-chloroanthraquinone; however, this compound was resistant to biodegradation under aerobic conditions using an activated sludge inoculum; only 2.8% BOD was reported following 2 weeks incubation. In water, 1-chloroanthraquinone is expected to adsorb to organic matter and suspended solids in the water column based on its Koc value. In reducing sediments, this compound will rapidly form the chloroanthrone with measured half-lives for the parent compound of <0.4 to 2.4 days. 1-Chloroanthraquinone may bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms; BCF values of 118-351 were measured in carp, an estimated BCF value of 630 was calculated using an estimated log Kow.

Incomplete information is available regarding the biodegradation potential of 1-chloroanthraquinone; however, this compound was resistant to biodegradation under aerobic conditions using an activated sludge inoculum; only 2.8% of the theoretical BOD was reported following 2 weeks incubation(5). 1-Chloroanthraquinone is not expected to volatilize from moist soil surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(6,SRC).",

In anoxic sediments, 1-chloroanthraquinone has been shown to quickly reduce resulting in the formation of an unspecified chloroanthrone(4). Half-lives of <0.4 to 2.4 days are reported for this compound dependent on the source of the sediment(4). An estimated BCF value of 630(3,SRC), based on an estimated log Kow(2,SRC) and measured BCF values of 118-351 in carp(5) indicate that 1-chloroanthraquinone may bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC). Incomplete information is available regarding the biodegradation potential of 1-chloroanthraquinone; however, this compound was resistant to biodegradation under aerobic conditions using an activated sludge inoculum; only 2.8% of theoretical BOD was reported following 2 weeks incubation(5). 1-Chloroanthraquinone is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-12 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant method(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The major use for solvents containing hexane is to extract vegetable oils from crops such as soybeans. These solvents are also used as cleaning agents in the printing, textile, furniture, and shoemaking industries. Certain kinds of special glues used in the roofing and shoe and leather industries also contain hexane. Several consumer products contain hexane, such as gasoline, quick-drying glues used in various hobbies, and rubber cement. (L175) ",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 211 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-methylpentane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-methylpentane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.9 days. 2-Methylpentane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-methylpentane is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 610. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Methylpentane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI screening test, 93% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 2-methylpentane may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc value. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 61 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2-methylpentane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-methylpentane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-methylpentane via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with consumer products containing 2-methylpentane. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 61(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 3.21(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). A 93% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI screening test(7) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase 2-methylpentane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.9 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.57x10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Degradation is much faster under photochemical smog conditions with a 26.4% loss in 5 hr being reported in one study(4). 2-Methylpentane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

A quarter of the microorganisms isolated from gasoline-contaminated groundwater, most notably of the Nocardia sp., supported growth of 2-methylpentane(2). Generally iso-alkanes are significantly more resistant to microbial attack than n-alkanes(3). However, a soil microorganism, Corynebacterium sp. oxidized 2-methylpentane, at about the same rate as n-pentane, although at a significantly lower rate than n-hexane(3). A mean half-life of 5.9 days was reported for all detectable hydrocarbons in an aerobic biodegradation study of gasoline in water from a domestic sewage treatment plant(4). The biodegradation half-lives of the C6-saturates compound group (n-hexane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, methylcylcopentane and cyclohexane), determined from biodegradation tests with water accommodated fractions(WAF) of Statjofrd fresh oil, Aquila fresh oil, and Marine diesel in seawater at 13 \u00b0C, were 2.8, 1.7, and 3.5 days respectively (without correction for lag phase) (5). The mean half-life from results for all three oils was determined to be 2.7 days for the C6-saturates group(5). 2-Methylpentane, and 10 other components of gasoline were completely degraded in a screening study using an activated sludge inoculum in less than 34 days(6). A mixture containing isopentane, pentane, cyclopentane, 2,3-dimethylbutane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, and cyclohexane, showed little degradation over the course of 30 days in a sediment/groundwater obtained from a contaminated jet fuel site in Oscoda, MI(7). 2-Methylpentane, present at 100 mg/L, reached 93% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in a screening test assessing biodegradation in water(8). Therefore, 2-methylpentane is confirmed to be readily biodegradable according to the standard test of the Japanese Ministry of Industry and Trade (MITI) (8).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2.9 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(SRC). 2-Methylpentane has low to moderate photochemical reactivity(2). Smog chamber studies of the NOX-air photooxidation of 2-methylpentane, resulted in a 26.4% depletion of 2-methylpentane in 5 hr(2). In the Houston Oxidant Field Study, the diurnal patterns of NO2, O3, and 2-methylpentane concentrations suggest that the photochemical reaction of 2-methylpentane and NO2 contribute to elevated ozone levels(3). The order-of-magnitude lower concentration of 2-methylpentane in the arctic summer compared with the spring is explained by differences in levels of sunlight and photochemical loss(4). 2-Methylpentane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(5). 2-Methylpentane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 3 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 4 days(SRC). 2-Methylpentane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

Hot soak (2-methylpentane=4.62 weight%) and cold-start (2-methylpentane = 4.40 weight%) emission profiles of an integrated sample of vehicles were measured inside a parking garage in Chicago during March 1990; hot-soak emissions were monitored after the morning rush hour while cold-start emissions were measured when the vehicles left for the evening rush hour(3). In Southern California, the profile for various emissions of vehicle exhaust included 2-methylpentane at 1.91, 3.17, 3.47, 3.69, 6.40, and 4.94 wt% for: an EPA 46 car study, mean composite of 13 samples from the Caldecott Tunnel, cold start, stabilized, hot start, and from an older fleet, respectively(4). 2-Methylpentane was identified in the exhaust of small engines at 1.4% and 1.56% of the total emissions using baseline gasoline with a composition profile which includes 2-methylpentane at 3.44 wt% and reformulated gasoline with a composition profile which includes 2-methylpentane at 3.62 wt%, respectively(5). Gasoline engine exhaust (noncatalyst and catalyst equipped), unburned gasoline (whole and headspace vapors) and commercial jet aircraft exhaust profiles include 2,-methylpentane at concentrations of 1.3, 2.1, 3.3, 2.8 and 0.4 wt%, respectively(6). 2-Methylpentane was detected in the effluent of a waste incinerator in Germany at a concentration of 3.20 ug/cu m(7). Source composition profiles for exhaust from an FTP test of 46 in-use passenger vehicles for 1975-1982 model years, Vancouver gasoline, Vancouver gasoline vapor, Whatcom County gasoline and Whatcom County gasoline vapor included 2-methylpentane at 1.910, 3.816, 3.829, 2.483, and 2.910%, NMHC (non-methane hydrocarbons), respectively(8). Emission rates of 2-methylpentane from light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles in the Fort McHenry tunnel(Baltimore, MD; collected June 1992) were measured as 16.6 and 11.9 mg/vehicle-mile, respectively; air concentrations at the east portal ranged from 6.3 to 112.4 ppbC(9). Emission rates of 2-methylpentane from light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles in the Tuscarora tunnel (Pennsylvania; collected September 1992) were measured as 7.6 and 9.9 mg/vehicle-mile, respectively; air concentrations ranged from 2.5 to 17.7 ppbC (9). A mean concentration of 6452 ppbV was determined for 2-methylpentane from exhaust samples taken from 6 different UK cars(10). 2-Methylpentane was emitted from the tailpipe of automobiles at a rate of 6,310 ug 2-methylpentane per kilometer (vehicles equipped with catalytic converters) and 827,000 ug 2-methylpentane per kilometer (vehicles without catalytic converters)(11).",

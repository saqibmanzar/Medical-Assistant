If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 35.9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-pentene will exist solely in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,2,4-triemthyl-2-pentene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.4 hrs. The second order rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-pentene with photochemically-produced ozone has been determined to be 1.39X10-16 cu cm/molecule sec at 23.6 \u00b0C; the half-life for this reaction is 2 hours. Reaction of vapor-phase 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-pentene with nitrate radical may be an important night-time loss process based on its molecular structure. If released to soil, 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-pentene is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 276. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.881 atm-cu m/mole. 2,2,4-Trimethyl-2-pentene may potentially volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. On exposure of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene to activated sludge in the Warburg respirometer test using oxygen uptake as a measure of oxidation, a theoretical oxygen demand for 6,12, and 24 hour exposures was 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.7%, respectively suggesting that biodegradation in soil and water is expected to be slow. If released into water, 2,2,4-triemtheyl-2-pentene is expected to slightly adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.1 and 101 hours, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 240 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-pentene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-pentene is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-pentene via inhalation of ambient air with this compound, gasoline products containing 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-pentene and diisobutylene. (SRC)",

On exposure of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene to activated sludge in the Warburg respirometer test using oxygen uptake as a measure of oxidation, a theoretical oxygen demand for 6,12, and 24 hour exposures was 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.7%, respectively suggesting that biodegradation in soil and water is expected to be slow(5). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 240(3,SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 4.0(6,SRC), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high.",

Vapor-phase 2,2,4-triemthyl-2-pentene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.4 hrs(SRC), calculated from its estimated rate constant of 8.77X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC)determined using a structure estimation method(3). The second-order rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-pentene with photochemically-produced ozone is 1.39X10-16 cu cm/molecule sec at 296.6 K; the half-life for this reaction is 2 hours(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

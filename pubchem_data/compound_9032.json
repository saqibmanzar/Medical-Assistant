PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The major excretion metabolite of cyanide in urine was thiocyanate, and this metabolite accounted for 71 and 79% of the total urinary activity in 12 hr and 24 hr, respectively.

The signs of toxicity and effect of equitoxic LD50 doses of saturated and unsaturated aliphatic mono- and dinitriles on tissue and blood CN levels, tissue glutathione levels and cytochrome c oxidase activities were studied in rats. Signs of toxicity were classified into cholinomimetic effects observed with unsaturated nitriles and CNS effects observed with saturated potassium cyanide. Hepatic and blood CN levels 1 hr after treatment were highest following malononitrile and decreased in the order of propionitrile > potassium cyanide > butyronitrile > acrylonitrile > allylcyanide > fumaronitrile > acetonitrile. The order differed in brain where potassium cyanide preceded malononitrile and PCN. Hepatic and cytochrome c oxidase were significantly inhibited and corresponded to their CN levels. No significant inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase was observed in vitro. Acrylonitrile was the only nitrile which significantly reduced tissue GSH levels. Toxic expression of aliphatic nitriles depended on CN release and their degree of unsaturation. With unsaturated aliphatic nitriles CN release played a minimal role in their toxicity. /Cyanides/",

Degradation of cyanogenic glycosides of cassava by R oryzae was studied by growing the organism in potato dextrose broth with and without linarmarin and potassium cyanide. The influence of adaptation of the organism to low and high cyanide concentrations on both growth and the release of extracellular rhodanese into cyanide containing media was studied. Nonadapted cultures of R oryzae grow poorly when compared with the cyanide adapted cultures. However non-adapted R oryzae cultures released large quantities of rhodanese when compared with the adapted ones. Potassium cyanide (1.0 mM) was found to be an efficient inducer of rhodanese whereas potassium cyanide (5.0 mM) repressed the release of rhodanese. A significant inductive effect was produced by thiosulphate and thiocyanate.",

Potassium cyanide is used commercially for fumigation, electroplating, and extracting gold and silver from ores. Hydrogen cyanide gas released by potassium cyanide has a distinctive bitter almond odor (others describe a musty \u201cold sneakers smell\u201d), but a large proportion of people cannot detect it; the odor does not provide adequate warning of hazardous concentrations. It is usually shipped as capsules, tablets, or pellets. Potassium cyanide absorbs water from air (is hygroscopic or deliquescent).",

Of all the seven procedures studied, the modified Roberts-Jackson method is the best. It gives complete recovery for all but one of the simple cyanides without decomposing the complex cyanides. ... It has the unique ability to perform accurately in the presence of both sulfide and thiocyanate. Incomplete recovery of cyanide is found only from the mercury cyanide compounds. The addition of chloride ion during analysis will probably overcome this deficiency. A lower limit of 2 ppb + or - 1 ppb is possible with a precision of + or - 10% above 10 ppb. ... The ligand-exchange procedure appears to be the most advantageous method of analysis of total cyanides. /Total cyanides/",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA 1988 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern.

They are also widely used in the synthesis of organic and inorganic chemicals (e.g., nitriles, carboxylic acids, amides, esters, and amines; heavy metal cyanides) and in the production of chelating agents.  HUMAN EXPOSURE: Cyanides are well absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract or skin and rapidly absorbed via the respiratory tract. Once absorbed, cyanide is rapidly and ubiquitously distributed throughout the body, although the highest levels are typically found in the liver, lungs, blood, and brain. There is no accumulation of cyanide in the blood or tissues following chronic or repeated exposure.  Approximately 80% of absorbed cyanide is metabolized to thiocyanate in the liver by the mitochondrial sulfur transferase enzyme rhodanese and other sulfur transferases. Thiocyanate is excreted in the urine. Minor pathways for cyanide detoxification involve reaction with cystine to produce aminothiazoline- and iminothiazolidinecarboxylic acids and combination with hydroxycobalamin (vitamin B12a) to form cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12); these end-products are also excreted in the urine. The principal features of the toxicity profile for cyanide are its high acute toxicity by all routes of administration, with a very steep and rate-dependent dose-effect curve, and chronic toxicity, probably mediated through the main metabolite and detoxification product, thiocyanate. The toxic effects of cyanide ion in humans and animals are generally similar and are believed to result from inactivation of cytochrome oxidase and inhibition of cellular respiration and consequent histotoxic anoxia. The primary targets of cyanide toxicity in humans are the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems. The endocrine system is also a potential target for long-term toxicity, as a function of continued exposure to thiocyanate, which prevents the uptake of iodine in the thyroid and acts as a goitrogenic agent.  Sequele after severe acute intoxications may include neuropsychiatric manifestations and Parkinson-type disease. Cyanide from tobacco smoke has been implicated as a contributing factor in tobacco-alcohol amblyopia. Long-term exposure to lower concentrations of cyanide in occupational settings can result in a variety of symptoms related to central nervous system effects.  Cyanides are weakly irritating to the skin and eye; alkali salts have not been identified.  ANIMAL/PLANT STUDIES: The principal features of the toxicity profile for cyanide are its high acute toxicity by all routes of administration, with a very steep and rate-dependent dose-effect curve, and chronic toxicity, probably mediated through the main metabolite and detoxification product, thiocyanate. The toxic effects of cyanide ion in humans and animals are generally similar and are believed to result from inactivation of cytochrome oxidase and inhibition of cellular respiration and consequent histotoxic anoxia. The primary targets of cyanide toxicity in animals are the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems. The endocrine system is also a potential target for long-term toxicity, as a function of continued exposure to thiocyanate, which prevents the uptake of iodine in the thyroid and acts as a goitrogenic agent.  In a 13-week repeated-dose toxicity study in which cyanide was administered in drinking-water, there were no clinical signs associated with central nervous system effects or histopathological effects in the brain or thyroid of rats or mice. There were slight changes in the reproductive tract in male rats, which, although they apparently would not affect fertility in rats.  The examination of neurotoxicity in this study was limited to clinical observation and optical microscopy in autopsy. The few available studies specifically intended to investigate neurotoxicity, while reporting adverse effects at exposure levels of 1.2 mg cyanide/kg body weight per day in rats and 0.48 mg cyanide/kg body weight per day in goats, suffer from weaknesses that preclude their quantitative assessment.  In relation to characterization of concentration-response for repeated-dose toxicity for inhalation (relevant principally to the occupational environment), in three separate studies in rats, there were no adverse systemic effects in rats exposed to acetone cyanohydrin, which is rapidly hydrolysed to hydrogen cyanide at physiological pH, at concentrations up to 211 mg/m3 (corresponding to a concentration of 67 mg hydrogen cyanide/m3). The steepness of the dose-effect curve is illustrated by the observation of 30% mortality among rats exposed part of the day to 225 mg acetone cyanohydrin/m3 (71 mg hydrogen cyanide/m3).  Adverse effects of exposure to the low concentrations of cyanide that are generally present in the general environment (<1 ug/m3 in ambient air; <10 ug/litre in water) are unlikely. /Cyanide/",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

Various doses of potassium cyanide, 2-8 umol/kg, were administered intravenously with and without inhalation of 1, 2 and 3% carbon monoxide via a respirator. The dose-response relationship between potassium cyanide and the fluorescence increase fitted a salient sigmoid curve with a steep slope, and carbon monoxide was potent to increase fluorescence independently and shifted the dose response curve for potassium cyanide to the left. The combined effect of carbon monoxide and potassium cyanide was of a critical dose for intracellular respiration, it had the appearance of synergism.",

The mechanism of potentiation of sodium thiosulfate by chlorpromazine was studied alone and in combination with sodium nitrite. Although chlorpromazine was found to induce a hypothermic response, the mechanism of enhancement of the antagonism of cyanide by chlorpromazine does not correlate with the hypothermia produced. Various other possible mechanisms were investigated, such as rate of methemoglobin formation, enzymatic activity of rhodanese and cytochrome oxidase, and alpha-adrenergic blockade. The alpha-adrenergic blocking properties of chlorpromazine may provide a basis for its antidotal effect, since this protective effect can be reversed with an alpha-antagonist, methoxamine. /Cyanide/",

Salbutamol-induced protection was abolished by drugs at the following doses (sc, mg/kg); timolol (0.0085), bunolol (0.010), propranolol (0.038), pindolol (0.15), metoprolol (3.93), atenolol (5.69), and practolol (>10.0). Survival was restored dose dependently in isoproterenol-overdosed rats only by atenolol (0.44), practolol (0.51) and metoprolol (1.06). The cardioselectivity ratio (ie, salbutamol antagonism/isoproterenol antagonism) for these 3 compounds was as follows: practolol (>19.6), atenolol (12.9), and metoprolol (3.82).",

Signs of cyanide toxicosis occurred rapidly, with a mean time to signs of 3.3 and 2.7 min in control animals receiving 35 or 40 mg/kg KCN, respectively. All 26 of the control rats showed signs, and all but one in the 35 mg/kg group died within 19 min. Only 12 of 26 rats treated with superactivated charcoal showed signs of KCN toxicosis and eight of those animals died.",

Male Swiss-Webster mice were injected sc with 4.6 mg/kg (14)C labeled potassium cyanide. The animals were observed for signs of toxicity. Expired air was collected and assayed for radiolabeled hydrocyanic acid and carbon dioxide for up to 210 min after injection. Mice were pretreated with antidotal agents sodium nitrate, sodium thiosulfate, oxygen, alone or in combination, or oxygen intermediates hydrogen peroxide, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, superoxide dismutase, or diethyldithiocarbamic acid, and injected sc with potassium cyanide. Expired air was assayed for radioactive hydrocyanic acid and carbon dioxide as before. Potassium cyanide caused a transient decrease in exploratory behavior 1 to 2 min after injection, which returned to normal within 10 min. This was accompanied by a slight decrease in respiratory rate and dyspnea. These effects were not seen in animals pretreated with the antidotes. Approximately 1 and 2 percent of the potassium cyanide dose was expired as radiolabeled hydrocyanic acid and carbon dioxide, respectively. Pretreatment with the cyanide antidotes significantly reduced expiration of the pulmonary metabolites.",

The antidote, which has been used in France since 1970, has proved to be nontoxic and therefore can be given in cases where the diagnosis of cyanide poisoning is not absolutely certain. On the other hand, the Lilly Cyanide Antidote Kit, which has been approved for use in the USA for the same purpose, has been shown to be toxic and its use requires caution. The antidotal effectiveness of the association of hydroxoycobalamin and sodium thiosulfate has been demonstrated in mice and other animal species poisoned with cyanide. Most animal studies reveal a strong antidotal synergism between the two agents. In France, the efficacy of the antidotal combination has been proved in patients who have ingested as much as 1.5 g of potassium cyanide and have blood cyanide levels on the order of 15 ug/ml. In the USA, the antidotal combination is designated as an orphan drug by the FDA and studies have been started to validate its safety and efficacy before being approved for use in this country. /Cyanide/",

Within one hour, coma, apnea, metabolic acidosis, and seizures developed. Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate were administered. Dramatic improvement in the clinical condition occurred by the completion of antidote infusion. Methemoglobin level was 2% immediately after nitrite administration. Serial whole blood cyanide levels were obtained, documenting a highest measured level of 15.68 ug/ml. Estimations of toxicokinetic parameters including terminal half-life (19 hr), clearance (163 ml/minute), and volume of distribution (0.41 l/kg) were calculated. The nitrite/thiosulfate combination was clinically efficacious in this case and resulted in complete recovery.",

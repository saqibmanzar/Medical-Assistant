When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The Agency has evaluated the dietary risk associated with Tebuthiuron and has determined that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm to any population subgroup will result from exposure to Tebuthiuron when considering dietary exposure and all other nonoccupational sources of pesticide exposure for which there is reliable information. Therefore, no mitigation measures are needed, and the tolerances established for residues of Tebuthiuron in/on raw agricultural commodities are now considered reassessed as safe under section 408(q) of the FFDCA.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.0X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tebuthiuron will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tebuthiuron will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days. Particulate-phase tebuthiuron will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Photodegradation of tebuthiuron on soil may occur slowly, as the compound did not degrade in sterile aqueous buffered (pH 5) solutions which were continuously irradiated for 33 days with a xenon light source; therefore, direct photolysis by sunlight is not likely to be an important environmental fate process. If released to soil, tebuthiuron is expected to have very high to high mobility based upon Koc values of 2.70 to 130. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. A half-life of 35.4 months in a sandy loam soil at 75% field moisture capacity suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, tebuthiuron is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the reported Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A hydrolysis half-life of greater than 64 days suggests that hydrolysis is not an important environmental fate process. Occupational exposure to tebuthiuron may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tebuthiuron is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to tebuthiuron via ingestion of contaminated well water in agricultural regions where tebuthiuron is applied. (SRC)",

The low removal rate in runoff is believed to be due to the timing of the application relative to rain events. Tebuthiuron moved to a depth of 15 cm in 8 months with 326 mm of precipitation and remained at that depth despite additional precipitation(1). The total amount of tebuthiuron remaining in the test plots after 21 months was 38% of that applied(1). Accordingly, it would take 2.9 to 7.2 years for the tebuthiuron level to fall below the detection limit. The herbicide retained its activity after 21 months. Another investigator found that tebuthiuron moved to 61 cm after 6 months in Houston black clay, soil typical of the Blackland Prairie and that the herbicide was still active after 2.5 years(1). In studies in which tebuthiuron was applied to field plots in central Utah as 40% (206 mg) pellets at 0.6 or 1.1 kg/ha, it was found that tebuthiuron moved downward and outward from the point of placement of the pellet(2). Dissipation from the upper 3 cm of soil within 2 cm of the pellet was best explained by a nonlinear expression with the time after placement as the independent variable; after 180, 365, and 730 days the concn in the soil was 53.0, 10.6, and 2.20 ppm, respectively(2). Based on a review of the literature, tebuthiuron exhibits a field half-life of 360 days(3).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

In a 9-month study, thiadiazole-labled 14C tebuthiuron at a concentration of 6 ppm incubated in a sandy loam soil at 24 \u00b0C and 75% field moisture capacity exhibited a half-life of 35.4 months(1). In a 160-day study of the effect of moisture on the disappearance kinetics of tebuthiuron from an alfisol (pH 8.3, 0.640% organic matter, 21.6 meq/100 g CEC) and vertisol (pH 8.4, 1.015% organic matter, 46.9 meq/100 g CEC) soil, it was found that the amount of extractable tebuthiuron decreased rapidly for 40-80 days and then more gradually. The kinetics were consistent with a model in which the tebuthiuron distributes into two compartments, bound and labile, in which the labile pool is degradable and the bound pool is unavailable but may reenter the labile pool after a long time. The disappearance curve was resolved into two first order rates, the faster representing the loss of chemical into the bound pool which is not involved in the degradative process and the slower representing disappearance through degradation. The degradation rates in vertisol at saturation, field capacity, and 50% field capacity were 0.00499, 0.00254, and 0.00251/day (half-lives 139, 276, and 276 days), respectively. The degradation rates in alfisol at saturation, field capacity, and 50% field capacity were 0.00833, 0.00763, and 0.00701/day (half-lives 83, 91, and 99 days), respectively. The binding half-lives at saturation, field capacity, and 50% field capacity were 87, 37, and 30 days, respectively, for the vertisol and 19, 14, and 18 days, respectively, for the alfisol(2). The slow binding rates and the inability to extract the bound tebuthiuron suggests that chemical bond formation may be occurring(SRC). The rate of disappearance from the labile pool was greater at higher moisture levels. The rate of entry into the bound pool and degradation were higher for the soil with higher organic matter and clay content(2).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Tebuthiuron is stable in aqueous media between pH 5 and 9. The hydrolysis half-life at 25 \u00b0C is greater than 64 days at pH 3, 6, and 9(2). Data indicate that photodegradation of tebuthiuron on soil may occur slowly but that this is not likely to be a route of dissipation(3). The compound did not degrade in sterile aqueous buffered (pH 5) solutions which were continuously irradiated for 33 days with a xenon light source at approximately 25 \u00b0C(3). Therefore, direct photolysis by sunlight is not likely to be an important environmental fate process(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a suggested classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggest that tebuthiuron has high to very high mobility in soil(SRC). The principal route of dissipation in the environment is mobility in soil(4). The soil/water distribution constant of tebuthiuron in Eufaula sand (% OC not reported) was 0.2(5). Adsorption of tebuthiuron to soil increases with the organic carbon and clay content of the soil. Sorption Kd values for tebuthiuron on six acid, low base saturated sands as a function of depth ranged from 0.002 to 3.6 L/kg with the greatest sorption on soils from the surface 0-5 cm depth and the least on soils from depths >65 cm; sorption was shown to correlate to soil organic carbon(6). A mean Kd value of 1.63 based on 9 samples has been also reported(7).",

After 9 years, 55-73% of the tebuthiuron was at depths between 30 and 90 cm(1). Small amounts of tebuthiuron were found as deep as 105 cm 6 to 9 years after application and small amounts were found in the upper 7 cm 10 years after application(1). Long-term leaching was not affected by application rate and leaching was not appreciably different in clay or loam soils(1). Lysimeter experiments were performed with intact soil columns from several upper Great Lakes sites (acidic, sandy soil) in which 440 mm of water was applied over a 130-day study period(2). Tebuthiuron leached to the 150-cm level in two lysimeters after 66 days and was detected at that level in 12 of 36 treated lysimeters. No tebuthiuron reached the 150-cm level in soils from two of the six sites where the pH of the surface 40 cm of soil was 4.7 and the base saturation averaged 22%; small amounts of tebuthiuron were recovered from four more acidic sites where the pH averaged 4.3 and the base saturation was <6%. Concns of tebuthiuron in the surface layers of soil were nearly five times that at the 150 cm level indicating that most of the herbicide remains in the upper profiles after the first growing season. In cited studies(2), the distribution of tebuthiuron applied at 8.8 kg/ha to a boreal podzol was distributed, 310 days post treatment, 98.6% in the surface 8 cm and 1.4% in upper B horizon; in a semi-arid rangeland site, for the first five years post-treatment most of the tebuthiuron remained in the surface 60 cm of soil, mainly in the 7-30 cm zone, and from 9-11 years it was mainly in the 60-90 cm zone(2).",

Tebuthiuron was uniformly distributed in the soil in all three systems. Under the unsaturated flow conditions, 0.9%, 0.7%, and 40.9% of the applied tebuthiuron was in the leachate in columns filled with Portsmouth sandy loam (4.4% organic matter, pH 5.4), Rains silt loam (1.7% organic matter, pH 6.0), and Davidson clay (1.3% organic matter, pH 5.6), respectively(1). The high amount of leaching in the Davidson clay is related to the high flow rate through this fine textured soil, compared with the relatively slow flow rates in the other, coarse-textured soils. Additionally, about half of the applied tebuthiuron was retained in the upper 5 cm of the Portsmouth and Rains soil, while only 2.4% was retained in the 0-5 cm depth of the Davidson clay.",

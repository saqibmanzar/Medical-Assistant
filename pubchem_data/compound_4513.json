PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The nizatidine AUC was directly proportional to dose for both groups of volunteers. Calculated pharmacokinetic variables in the elderly versus the young were Tl/2 (1.9 versus 1.6 hr), apparent plasma clearance (32 versus 40 l/h) and apparent volume of distribution (1.2 versus 1.3 l/kg). The impaired renal function of some elderly volunteers prolonged nizatidine elimination and lowered its clearance. Renal impairment rather than advanced age per se was the predominant factor in decreasing the nizatidine elimination rate. No serious adverse effects occurred.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

The ALT elevations are usually asymptomatic and transient and may resolve without dose modification. Rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury have been reported in patients receiving nizatidine, but too few cases have been reported to characterize a typical time to onset or pattern of injury. More information is available on the hepatotoxicity of other H2 blockers such as ranitidine and cimetidine which have been implicated in causing clinically apparent liver injury in 1:20,000 to 1:100,000 users. The time to onset of H2 blocker induced liver injury tends to be short, between 1 and 6 weeks of starting. The typical pattern of serum enzyme elevations varies from hepatocellular to cholestatic, most cases being \u201cmixed\u201d. The injury can be severe, but is typically mild-to- moderate in severity and self-limited in course, resolving within 4 to 12 weeks of stopping. Immunoallergic features (rash, fever, eosinophilia) are uncommon, as is autoantibody formation. Liver biopsy histology often shows centrolobular (zone 3) necrosis with mixed cellular infiltrates and mild cholestasis.",

Other mode of actions include an adenosine antagonistic effect on the activity of CD4 lymphocytes and mediator release from mast cells thereby decreasing lung sensitivity to allergens and other substances that cause inflammation. Aminophylline also acts as a CNS stimulant and exerts a positive chronotropic and inotropic effect on the heart.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Under the acidic conditions of the stomach, the theophylline salts and compounds release free theophylline. ... Microcrystalline dosage forms and oral solutions of theophyllines are absorbed more rapidly, but not to a greater extent, than are uncoated tablets. Although the rate of absorption is slower, extended-release preparations (capsules and tablets) of theophylline are generally absorbed to the same extent as uncoated tablets; however, the actual rate of absorption of extended-release preparations may differ. Extended-release preparations of theophyllines have been formulated to release the drug at various rates suitable for dosing every 8-12, 12, or 24 hours; however, the actual dosing frequency for a given patient depends on their individual pharmacokinetic parameters. Since the rate and extent of absorption may differ between various extended-release preparations and sometimes between different dosage sizes of the same preparation, patients should generally be stabilized on a given preparation; substitution of one extended-release preparation for another should generally only be made when the preparations have been shown to be equivalent and/or the patient is evaluated pharmacokinetically during the transition period. Absorption of theophyllines may also be delayed, but is generally not reduced, by the presence of food in the GI tract; however, the effect of food on the absorption of extended-release preparations appears to be variable, and the manufacturer's recommendations for administration of specific preparations should be followed. /Theophyllines/",

Due to the wide intersubject variability of the rate of theophylline metabolism, non-linearity of elimination may begin in some patients at serum theophylline concentrations <10 mcg/mL. Since this non-linearity results in more than proportional changes in serum theophylline concentrations with changes in dose, it is advisable to make increases or decreases in dose in small increments in order to achieve desired changes in serum theophylline concentrations. Accurate prediction of dose-dependency of theophylline metabolism in patients a priori is not possible, but patients with very high initial clearance rates (i.e., low steady-state serum theophylline concentrations at above average doses) have the greatest likelihood of experiencing large changes in serum theophylline concentration in response to dosage changes. /Theophylline/",

In adults and children beyond one year of age, approximately 90% of the dose is metabolized in the liver. Biotransformation takes place through demethylation to 1-methylxanthine and 3-methylxanthine and hydroxylation to 1,3-dimethyluric acid. 1-methylxanthine is further hydroxylated, by xanthine oxidase, to 1-methyluric acid. About 6% of a theophylline dose is N-methylated to caffeine. Theophylline demethylation to 3-methylxanthine is catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 1A2, while cytochromes P-450 2E1 and P-450 3A3 catalyze the hydroxylation to 1,3-dimethyluric acid. Demethylation to 1-methylxanthine appears to be catalyzed either by cytochrome P-450 1A2 or a closely related cytochrome. In neonates, the N-demethylation pathway is absent while the function of the hydroxylation pathway is markedly deficient. The activity of these pathways slowly increases to maximal levels by one year of age. /Theophylline/",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

After ingestion, theophylline is released from aminophylline, and theophylline relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchial airways and pulmonary blood vessels and reduces airway responsiveness to histamine, methacholine, adenosine, and allergen. Theophylline competitively inhibits type III and type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE), the enzyme responsible for breaking down cyclic AMP in smooth muscle cells, possibly resulting in bronchodilation. Theophylline also binds to the adenosine A2B receptor and blocks adenosine mediated bronchoconstriction. In inflammatory states, theophylline activates histone deacetylase to prevent transcription of inflammatory genes that require the acetylation of histones for transcription to begin.",

In reality, however, these phosphodiesterase inhibitors may have additional sites of action that could complicate the interpretation of the results. These additional sites of action could include antagonism of inhibitory adenosine autoreceptors and release of intracellular calcium. The purpose of the present study was to determine which of the above three is the primary mechanism by which theophylline and aminophylline affect transmitter release at the mammalian neuromuscular junction.  Quantal release measurements were made using intracellular recording techniques. A variety of drugs were used to elucidate this pathway. Isoproterenol, an adenylate cyclase activator, was first used to establish the effect of enhanced levels of cAMP. Theophylline application on its own or in the presence of a drug combination that blocked the adenosine receptor and phosphodiesterase pathways caused significant release depression, opposite to what is expected if it was functioning to enhance cAMP levels. However, when applied in the presence of a drug combination that blocked the adenosine receptor, phosphodiesterase and intracellular ryanodine calcium pathways, theophylline was unable to depress release. Therefore, it was concluded that the major mechanism of action of theophylline is depression of transmitter release by causing the release of intracellular calcium. Aminophylline application alone resulted in a significant enhancement of release. However, when coupled with an adenosine receptor blocker, the ability of aminophylline to enhance transmitter release was blocked, suggesting that its dominant mechanism of action is adenosine receptor inhibition. Taken together, these results indicate that the use of theophylline and aminophylline is inappropriate when examining the role of cAMP at the mammalian neuromuscular junction.",

While the mechanisms of action of theophylline  are  not  known  with  certainty,  studies  in  animals  suggest  that  bronchodilatation  is mediated by the inhibition of two isozymes of phosphodiesterase (PDE III and, to a lesser extent, PDE IV)  while  non-bronchodilator  prophylactic  actions  are  probably  mediated  through  one  or  more different molecular mechanisms, that do not involve inhibition of PDE III or antagonism of adenosine receptors.  Some  of  the  adverse  effects  associated  with  theophylline  appear  to  be  mediated  by inhibition of PDE III (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and emesis) and adenosine receptor antagonism (e.g., alterations in cerebral blood flow).  Theophylline increases the force of contraction of diaphragmatic muscles. This action appears to be due to enhancement of calcium uptake through an adenosine-mediated channel. /Theophylline/",

Aminophylline is prepared from theophylline and aqueous ethylenediamine. It is used as bronchodilator agent. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Aminophylline can trigger seizures in patients without known underlying epilepsy or added risk factor for seizure exacerbation in epilepsy. Most of these seizures are difficult to control and are underappreciated compared to other drug toxicities. Despite a long clinical history of aminophylline-induced seizures, relatively little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to methylxanthine-induced seizure generation. Fatalities in adults have generally occurred during or following IV administration of large doses of aminophylline in patients with renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular complications. In other patients, the rapidity of the injection, rather than the dose used, appears to be the more important factor precipitating acute hypotension, seizures, coma, cardiac standstill, ventricular fibrillation, and death. IV aminophylline or theophylline should therefore be given slowly. In children, fatalities usually are a result of overdosage and marked sensitivity to the CNS stimulation of theophylline. There are some reports of aminophylline hypersensitivity reaction and the most cases were delayed type reaction in English literatures. However, most of Japanese cases were immediate type. Acetylation is a main metabolic pathway of ethylenediamine. Most of Japanese have a rapid or intermediate acetylators on the other hand. Caucasian have a 50% likelihood of being slow acetylators. This difference suggest the different incidences of immediate and delayed reaction of aminophylline hypersensitivity reaction in Japanese and Caucasian respectively. Aminophylline treatment might be associated with elevated levels of myocardial enzymes. In vitro, aminophylline protected apoptosis of MRC-5 cells through the inactivation of caspases 3 and 8. ANIMAL STUDIES: Aminophylline (100-250 mg/kg) consistently induced seizures and post-ictal mortality in mice, and conventional anticonvulsants and adenosine agonists were ineffective in antagonizing them. Biochemical assay of brain homogenates showed that aminophylline seizures were associated with enhancements in brain malone dialdehyde and nitric oxide metabolites levels, whereas, superoxide dismutase activity was reduced, and these changes were attenuated after melatonin and L-NAME pretreatment. Aminophylline induced convulsions in rats in a dose-dependent manner, and both incidence of seizure and mortality were maximum at 300 mg/kg and there was significant increase of free radical generation. Pre-treatment with antioxidants showed differential attenuating effects on aminophylline induced free radical generation, but they were very much ineffective in antagonizing aminophylline induced seizures and post-seizure mortality by any appreciable extent. In pregnant rabbits, aminophylline treatment produced no acceleration in general anatomic lung development, as reflected in the ratio of lung air-space capacity to lung tissue weight. Under similar experimental conditions, maternal caffeine treatment had no effect on fetal rabbit lungs. In other experiment, pregnant rabbit does were treated intravenously with aminophylline (6 mg/kg/day) from the twenty-fifth day after the day of mating, and the fetuses were delivered by hysterotomy on the twenty-eighth day. One group of neonates was breathing air, and another group 100% oxygen. Lung mechanics were evaluated in the newborn animals during spontaneous or artificial ventilation, and the lungs were studied histologically with particular reference to the alveolar volume density. Aminophylline-treated litters had greater body weights, an improved survival rate, and an increased amount of phosphatidylglycerol in lung lavage fluid. Respiratory frequency was increased in aminophylline-treated animals breathing air, but data on lung compliance showed no significant difference between treated and control animals. It was concluded that the beneficial effect of aminophylline can be attributed largely to a combination of accelerated fetal growth and improved postnatal regulation of breathing and less to a specific influence on the biochemical and functional maturation of the lung.

Maternal theophylline use may occasionally cause stimulation and irritability and fretful sleep in infants. Newborn and especially preterm infants are most likely to be affected because of their slow elimination and low serum protein binding of theophylline. There is no need to avoid theophylline products; however, keep maternal serum concentrations in the lower part of the therapeutic range and monitor the infant for signs of theophylline side effects. Infant serum theophylline concentrations can help to determine if signs of agitation are due to theophylline. Avoiding breastfeeding for 2 hours after intravenous or 4 hours after an immediate-release oral theophylline product can decrease the dose received by the breastfed infant. When theophylline is given as an oral sustained-release product, timing of nursing with respect to the dose is of little or no benefit.",

Maternal aminophylline use may occasionally cause stimulation and irritability and fretful sleep in infants. Newborn and especially preterm infants are most likely to be affected because of their slow elimination and low serum protein binding of theophylline. There is no need to avoid aminophylline products; however, keep maternal serum theophylline concentrations in the lower part of the therapeutic range and monitor the infant for signs of theophylline side effects. Infant serum theophylline concentrations can help to determine if signs of agitation are due to theophylline. Avoiding breastfeeding for 2 hours after intravenous or 4 hours after an immediate-release oral aminophylline product can decrease the dose received by the breastfed infant.",

Another five infants reported in this paper showed no adverse reactions after maternal theophylline ingestion. Accumulation of theophylline in infant serum appears most likely in neonates and premature infants because they eliminate theophylline slowly.",

Nine beagle dogs were randomly allocated at the propofol rates of 0.75 (group A), 1.00 (group B), and 1.25 (group C) mg/kg/min. During period 1, propofol only was infused, while during period 2, aminophylline only, at the rate of 0.69 (group A), 1.37 (group B), and 2.62 (group C) mg/kg/hr. During periods 3-5, the two drugs were co-administered. The aminophylline infusion rate was 0.69 (period 3), 1.37 (period 4), and 2.62 (period 5) mg/kg/hr. The aminophylline was infused from 0 to 30 h, and the propofol was infused at 24 hr for 20 min. Blood samples and electroencephalograms were obtained at preset intervals. In the linear regression between log-transformed doses of aminophylline and AUC inf, the slope was 0.6976 (95% CI 0.5242-0.8710). Pharmacokinetics of aminophylline was best described by a one-compartment, with enzyme auto-induction, model. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol were best described by a three-compartment model and a sigmoid Emax model, respectively. Pharmacodynamic parameter estimates of propofol were: k(e0) = 0.805/min, E0 = 0.76, Emax = 0.398, Ce(50 na) = 2.38 ug/mL (without aminophylline-exposure), C(e50 wa) = 4.49 ug/mL (with aminophylline-exposure), and gamma = 2.21. Propofol becomes less potent when exposed to aminophylline.

The interaction may be pharmacodynamic, i.e., alterations in the therapeutic response to theophylline or another drug or occurrence of adverse effects without a change in serum theophylline concentration. More frequently, however, the interaction is pharmacokinetic, i.e., the rate of theophylline clearance is altered by another drug resulting in increased or decreased serum theophylline concentrations. Theophylline only rarely alters the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. The drugs listed in Table have the potential to produce clinically significant pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions with theophylline. The information in the \"Effect\" column of Table assumes that the interacting drug is being added to a steady-state theophylline regimen. If theophylline is being initiated in a patient who is already taking a drug that inhibits theophylline clearance (e.g., cimetidine, erythromycin), the dose of theophylline required to achieve a therapeutic serum theophylline concentration will be smaller. Conversely, if theophylline is being initiated in a patient who is already taking a drug that enhances theophylline clearance (e.g., rifampin), the dose of theophylline required to achieve a therapeutic serum theophylline concentration will be larger. Discontinuation of a concomitant drug that increases theophylline clearance will result in accumulation of theophylline to potentially toxic levels, unless the theophylline dose is appropriately reduced. Discontinuation of a concomitant drug that inhibits theophylline clearance will result in decreased serum theophylline concentrations, unless the theophylline dose is appropriately increased. /Theophylline/",

In patients with theophylline overdose who are at high risk for theophylline-induced seizures, e.g., patients with acute overdoses and serum theophylline concentrations >100 ug/mL or chronic overdosage in patients >60 years of age with serum theophylline concentrations >30 ug/mL, the need for anticonvulsant therapy should be anticipated. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam should be drawn into a syringe and kept at the patient's bedside and medical personnel qualified to treat seizures should be immediately available. In selected patients at high risk for theophylline-induced seizures, consideration should be given to the administration of prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy. Situations where prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy should be considered in high risk patients include anticipated delays in instituting methods for extracorporeal removal of theophylline (e.g., transfer of a high risk patient from one healthcare facility to another for extracorporeal removal) and clinical circumstances that significantly interfere with efforts to enhance theophylline clearance (e.g., a neonate where dialysis may not be technically feasible or a patient with vomiting unresponsive to antiemetics who is unable to tolerate multiple-dose oral activated charcoal). In animal studies, prophylactic administration of phenobarbital, but not phenytoin , has been shown to delay the onset of theophylline-induced generalized seizures and to increase the dose of theophylline required to induce seizures (i.e., markedly increases the LD 50 ). Although there are no controlled studies in humans, a loading dose of intravenous phenobarbital (20 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes) may delay or prevent life-threatening seizures in high risk patients while efforts to enhance theophylline clearance are continued. Phenobarbital may cause respiratory depression, particularly in elderly patients and patients with COPD. /Theophylline/",

Theophylline has been recognized as an important drug for not only asthma but also corticosteroid-insensitive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To clarify the role of theophylline in hypercapnic ventilatory responses in humans, we analyzed the effects of aminophylline administered at the usual clinical therapeutic doses on ventilation and augmentation of respiratory muscle contractility in room air and under 3 conditions of hypercapnia. We performed electromyography (EMG) of the parasternal intercostal muscle (PARA) and transversus abdominis muscle (TA) in 7 healthy subjects and recorded both ventilatory parameters and EMG data in room air and under 3 conditions of hypercapnia before (control) and during aminophylline administration. Before aminophylline administration (control), hypercapnic stimulation elicited ventilatory augmentation in a hypercapnia intensity-dependent manner. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, frequency of respiration, and minute ventilation) showed significant increases from lower PaCO2 levels during aminophylline administration when compared with the corresponding values before aminophylline administration. EMG activity of both PARA and TA increased significantly at each level of hypercapnia, and those augmentations were shown from lower PaCO2 levels during aminophylline administration. Aminophylline administered at the usual clinical therapeutic dose increases ventilation and EMG activity of both inspiratory and expiratory muscles during hypercapnia in healthy humans.",

Six received an intravenous loading dose of aminophylline (6.0 mg/kg over 20 min) followed by a maintenance dose (0.9 mg/kg/hr) for 100 min. Another 7 subjects initially received smaller loading (3.0 mg/kg) and maintenance (0.45 mg/kg/hr) doses, and after 60 min they received a second loading dose (3.0 mg/kg) followed by a larger maintenance dose (0.9 mg/kg/hr) over 120 min. In these fasting volunteers, infusion of aminophylline, which produced theophylline levels in the usual therapeutic range (10 to 20 microgram/ml) caused small increases in plasma glucose levels without changing IRI, IRG, HGH, or cortisol. There were rapid, pronounced, and prolonged rises in FFA associated with the aminophylline infusion. Increases in FFA paralleled the rise in theophylline levels. It is concluded that routine therapeutic doses of theophylline, i.e., doses that achieve serum levels normally encountered in treatment for bronchial asthma, cause a marked rise in FFA and a slight rise in glucose (8 +/- 3 mg/dL) without changing levels of IRI, IRG, HGH, or cortisol.",

In general, patients who experience an acute overdose are less likely to experience seizures than patients who have experienced a chronic overdosage, unless the peak serum theophylline concentration is >100 ug/mL. After a chronic overdosage, generalized seizures, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, and death may occur at serum theophylline concentrations >30 ug/mL. The severity of toxicity after chronic overdosage is more strongly correlated with the patient's age than the peak serum theophylline concentration; patients >60 years are at the greatest risk for severe toxicity and mortality after a chronic overdosage. Pre-existing or concurrent disease may also significantly increase the susceptibility of a patient to a particular toxic manifestation, e.g., patients with neurologic disorders have an increased risk of seizures and patients with cardiac disease have an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias for a given serum theophylline concentration compared to patients without the underlying disease. /Theophylline/",

There are two common presentations: (1) acute overdose, i.e., ingestion of a single large excessive dose (>10 mg/kg) as occurs in the context of an attempted suicide or isolated medication error, and (2) chronic overdosage, i.e., ingestion of repeated doses that are excessive for the patient's rate of theophylline clearance. The most common causes of chronic theophylline overdosage include patient or care giver error in dosing, clinician prescribing of an excessive dose or a normal dose in the presence of factors known to decrease the rate of theophylline clearance, and increasing the dose in response to an exacerbation of symptoms without first measuring the serum theophylline concentration to determine whether a dose increase is safe. /Theophylline/",

To evaluate side effects of PDE inhibitors, this study analyzed changes in blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) during and after intravenous aminophylline in the animal model of MAS. Oxygen-ventilated rabbits were given meconium intratracheally (25 mg/mL, 4 mL/kg) or saline. Thirty minutes later, the animals were treated by intravenous aminophylline (Syntophyllin, 2 mg/kg) or saline (sham-treated controls). A second dose of the treatment was given 2 h later. During (5 min) and immediately after (5 min) the treatment, and during 5 h after the treatment, mean blood pressure in the femoral artery (MAP), HR and HRV were evaluated. In meconium-instilled animals, increases in MABP, HR, and HRV were observed already 5 min after aminophylline administration, while in saline-instilled animals aminophylline increased HR and caused inconsistant changes in HRV parameters compared to sham-treated animals. Within 5 h after the treatment administration, MAP, HR, and HRV parameters gradually returned to the initial values. Concluding, intravenous aminophylline may lead to acute cardiovascular changes. Thus, if aminophylline is used for treatment of MAS, its possible cardiovascular effects should be considered, particularly in patients with cardiovascular instability.",

We investigated whether N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are involved in aminophylline (theophylline-2-ethylenediamine)-induced convulsions that are augmented by heat exposure-induced hyperthermia in mice. Mice exposed to 33 \u00b0C temperatures for 2 hr had significantly increased body temperature (0.94 \u00b0C). Heat exposure significantly decreased time required for the onset of convulsions induced by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of aminophylline (300 mg/kg). The shortened time for onset of convulsions was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine (0.1, 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.). However, the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (1, 2 mg/kg, i.p.) did not have any effect. The pro-convulsant action of NMDA (100-125 mg/kg, i.p.) was enhanced by the heat exposure of 33 \u00b0C. However, the pro-convulsant actions of picrotoxin (3-4 mg/kg, i.p.), a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, were not affected by increased temperatures. These results suggest that NMDA receptors in the brain play a role in aminophylline-induced convulsions, which are augmented by heat exposure-induced hyperthermia in mice.",

We tested the hypothesis that aminophylline treatment may ameliorate the pulmonary and extrapulmonary effects of endotoxemia in a rat model. In anesthetized rats, a tracheotomy was performed along with catheterization of a femoral vein and artery. Anesthesia, fluid balance, and normothermia were maintained throughout the 6-h experiment. A stable hemodynamic and gas-exchange baseline was established at which time the rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group I received aminophylline (1 mg/kg) over 30 min followed by 0.5 mg/kg/hr. Group II received a single dose of endotoxin (4 mg/kg) while Group III received both aminophylline and endotoxin as described for Groups I and II, respectively. Gas-exchange profiles, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were determined every 2 hr. At hour 6, the rats were euthanized and lung, kidney, and heart tissue were removed for determination of water content. As our control group, we utilized data from our previously published study involving an identical surgical procedure with normal saline. Endotoxemia produced characteristic respiratory and hemodynamic signs of sepsis including hypotension, hyperventilation, tachycardia, and renal and pulmonary edema. Aminophylline treatment failed to prevent these endotoxemia-induced respiratory and hemodynamic manifestations of sepsis, but significantly improved the acid-base imbalance that developed during surgical procedures in saline-treated control rats. Further studies are warranted to determine potentially beneficial doses of aminophylline and resulting theophylline serum concentrations under such septic conditions.",

A physiological effect of these compounds is an elevation of the metabolic rate, but the mechanism of this increase is unclear. We have investigated the hypothesis that this elevation of metabolic rate in young animals is in part due to increased physical activity. Metabolic rate and spontaneous physical activity of weanling Fischer 344 rats were measured before and during 2 days of aminophylline administration. Our results show increased metabolic rate measured over 23 hr, concomitant with increased activity during treatment. Resting metabolic rate was not elevated. The results suggest that increased physical activity plays a major role in increasing metabolic rate during aminophylline treatment. Metabolic rate returned to control levels on the 2nd day of treatment despite a smaller but still significant elevation in physical activity. This suggests development of tolerance to the effects of aminophylline on activity together with adaptation to the metabolic effects of this drug.",

Passive smoke exposure has also been shown to increase theophylline clearance by up to 50%. Abstinence from tobacco smoking for one week causes a reduction of approximately 40% in theophylline clearance. Careful attention to dose reduction and frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations are required in patients who stop smoking.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

A clinical picture in which most or all of the following signs or symptoms are present: headache, blurred vision, weakness, tightness in chest, and constricted pupils. 4. Reduction of plasma and RBC cholinesterase activity to a level substantially below 50% of baseline values. Because of the wide normal range of RBC cholinesterase in the population, symptoms may be present with reported \"normal\" levels. 5. An acute illness that is not substantially longer than 48 hours. The classic presentation for acute organophosphate toxicity includes history, evidence of exposure to organophosphate (garlic odor), signs/symptoms of cholinergic excess, improvement with atropine or pralidoxime, and inhibition of cholinesterase in blood. /Organophosphate pesticide poisoning/",

Miosis, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea & frequency of urination ... Nicotinic effects consist of fasciculation of muscles, weakness & paralysis. Central nervous system effects include nervousness, apprehension, ataxia, convulsions & coma. Death is due to resp failure, or sometimes cardiac arrest. There is little difference between signs produced by different organophosphorus compounds, but route of absorption may influence one system more than another. /Organophosphorus cmpd/",

Trichloronate has been detected as a residue on a variety of foods. If released to soil, trichloronate should have no mobility. Volatilization of trichloronate from moist soil surfaces is expected given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, volatilization is not expected to be important from dry soil surfaces based on an experimental vapor pressure of 1.5X10-5 mm Hg. The half life of trichloronate in a loam soil was experimentally determined to be 180 and 177 days in laboratory experiments and 141 days (average) in field experiments. In a biodegradation test using trichloronate in a moist sandy loam and moist muck, biological activity disappeared within 16 weeks and 4 weeks, respectively. If released to water, trichloronate would adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Trichloronate would volatilize slowly from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6.2 days and 51 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 5600 suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. If released to the atmosphere, trichloronate will exist as a vapor. Vapor-phase trichloronate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 5.2 hours. The general population will be exposed to trichloronate via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with vapors, food and other products containing trichloronate. Occupational exposure would be by inhalation and dermal contact. (SRC)",

Volatilization of trichloronate may be important from moist soil surfaces(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values of vapor pressure(4) and water solubility(5). However, volatilization is not expected to be important from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based on an experimental vapor pressure of 1.5X10-5 mm Hg(5). The half-life of trichloronate in soil has been determined to be 139 days(4). Ks, a rate constant for the combined processes that affect the persistence of a chemical in the soil surface, for trichloronate was determined to be 0.0048, 0.0083, and 0.0037 per day for June-July, Aug-Sept, and Oct-Nov, respectively, and 0.0050 in a composite soil sample(6). The half life of trichloronate in a loam soil was experimentally determined to be 180 and 177 days in laboratory experiments and 141 days (average) in field experiments(7). In the field experiments, an average of 37% of the residue remained after 10 months(7). In a biodegradation test using trichloronate in a moist sandy loam and moist muck, biological activity disappeared within 16 weeks and 4 weeks, respectively(8).",

Trichloronate would volatilize slowly from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values for vapor pressure(3) and water solubility(4). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6.2 days and 51 days, respectively(1,SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF value of 5600(1,SRC), from an experimental log Kow(2) suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Biodegradation in water is likely to be slow based upon the persistence of trichloronate in soil(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                                                    "String": "The Henry's Law constant for trichloronate is estimated as 1.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) from its experimental values for vapor pressure, 1.5X10-5 mm Hg(1), and water solubility, 0.59 mg/l(2). This value indicates that trichloronate will volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 6.2 days(3,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 51 days(3,SRC). Trichloronate's vapor pressure, 1.5X10-5 mm Hg(2) indicates that volatilization from dry soils should not be important. However, trichloronate's Henry's Law constant(1,SRC) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).",

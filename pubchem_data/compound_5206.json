It is a volatile, non-flammable compound with a low solubility profile and blood/gas partition coefficient.

Sevoflurane is three times more potent than [desflurane], but has lower potency compared to [halothane] and [isoflurane]. Unlike other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane has a pleasant odor and does not irritate the airway. The hemodynamic and respiratory depressive effects of sevoflurane are well tolerated, and most patients receiving this anesthetic agent present little toxicity. Therefore, it can be used for inhalational induction in adults and children for a wide variety of anesthetic procedures.",

Sevoflurane may also interact directly with lipid matrix of neuronal membranes, thereby affecting gating properties of ion channels. In addition, this agent may activate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors hyperpolarizing cell membranes. This results in a general anesthetic effect, a decrease in myocardial contractility and mean arterial pressure as well as an increased respiratory rate.",

Together with desflurane, it is replacing isoflurane and halothane in modern anesthesiology. [Wikipedia] Sevoflurane induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. Sevoflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane. It also appears to bind the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydogenase and also binds to the GABA receptor, the large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated potassium channel, the glutamate receptor, and the glycine receptor.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

However, little is known regarding the potential retinoprotective effects of preconditioning by anesthetic drugs. Retinal ischemia can be modeled by permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). /Investigators/ studied the degree of ischemic injury with preconditioning by sevoflurane in the rat retina. During the BCCAO operation and preconditioning Wistar rats were anesthetized with 1 MAC of sevoflurane. ... /Four groups were examined/: non- and preconditioning groups in control and BCCAO animals. The duration of preconditioning period was 1 hr and it was performed 1 day before BCCAO. The retinas were processed for histological evaluation after 2 weeks survival to determine the cell number in the ganglion cell layer and the thickness of the whole retina and that of all retinal layers. BCCAO-induced retinal ischemic injury was ameliorated by sevoflurane preconditioning. Retinal thickness and the cell number in the ganglion cell layer were more retained in preconditioned animals after BCCAO compared to non-preconditioned group. These results suggest that preconditioning using sevoflurane could provide a new perspective in retinoprotective strategies.",

It does so by decreasing the extent of gap junction-mediated cell-cell coupling and altering the activity of the channels that underlie the action potential. Compared to [halothane] and [isoflurane], sevoflurane has a shorter emergence time, as well as a shorter time to first analgesia. To reach an equilibrium between alveolar and arterial partial pressure, only a minimal amount of sevoflurane needs to be dissolved in blood.   The use of sevoflurane can increase the risk of renal injury, respiratory depression, and QT prolongation. Also, it can lead to malignant hyperthermia, perioperative hyperkalemia, and pediatric neurotoxicity. Episodes of severe bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in pediatric patients with Down Syndrome given sevoflurane. Sevoflurane anesthesia may impair the performance of activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Metabolism also contributes significantly to the elimination pharmacokinetics of some volatile agents. Although innumerable studies have explored anesthetic metabolism in animals, there is little information on human volatile anesthetic metabolism with respect to comparative rates or the identity of the enzymes responsible for defluorination. The first purpose of this investigation was to compare the metabolism of the fluorinated ether anesthetics by human liver microsomes. The second purpose was to test the hypothesis that cytochrome P450 2E1 is the specific P450 isoform responsible for volatile anesthetic defluorination in humans. Microsomes were prepared from human livers. Anesthetic metabolism in microsomal incubations was measured by fluoride production. The strategy for evaluating the role of P450 2E1 in anesthetic defluorination involved three approaches: for a series of 12 human livers, correlation of microsomal defluorination rate with microsomal P450 2E1 content (measured by Western blot analysis), correlation of defluorination rate with microsomal P450 2E1 catalytic activity using marker substrates (para-nitrophenol hydroxylation and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation), and chemical inhibition by P450 isoform-selective inhibitors. The rank order of anesthetic metabolism, assessed by fluoride production at saturating substrate concentrations, was methoxyflurane > sevoflurane > enflurane > isoflurane > desflurane > 0. There was a significant linear correlation of sevoflurane and methoxyflurane defluorination with antigenic P450 2E1 content (r = 0.98 and r = 0.72, respectively), but not with either P450 1A2 or P450 3A3/4. Comparison of anesthetic defluorination with either para-nitrophenol or chlorzoxazone hydroxylation showed a significant correlation for sevoflurane (r = 0.93, r = 0.95) and methoxyflurane (r = 0.78, r = 0.66). Sevoflurane defluorination was also highly correlated with that of enflurane (r = 0.93), which is known to be metabolized by human P450 2E1. Diethyldithiocarbamate, a selective inhibitor of P450 2E1, produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of sevoflurane, methoxyflurane, and isoflurane defluorination. No other isoform-selective inhibitor diminished the defluorination of sevoflurane, whereas methoxyflurane defluorination was inhibited by the selective P450 inhibitors furafylline (P450 1A2), sulfaphenazole (P450 2C9/10), and quinidine (P450 2D6) but to a much lesser extent than by diethyldithiocarbamate. These results demonstrate that cytochrome P450 2E1 is the principal, if not sole human liver microsomal enzyme catalyzing the defluorination of sevoflurane. P450 2E1 is the principal, but not exclusive enzyme responsible for the metabolism of methoxyflurane, which also appears to be catalyzed by P450s 1A2, 2C9/10, and 2D6. The data also suggest that P450 2E1 is responsible for a significant fraction of isoflurane metabolism. Identification of P450 2E1 as the major anesthetic metabolizing enzyme in humans provides a mechanistic understanding of clinical fluorinated ether anesthetic metabolism and toxicity.",

The metabolism of sevoflurane is not inducible by barbiturates. As shown in Figure 5, inorganic fluoride concentrations peak within 2 hours of the end of sevoflurane anesthesia and return to baseline concentrations within 48 hours post-anesthesia in the majority of cases (67%). The rapid and extensive pulmonary elimination of sevoflurane minimizes the amount of anesthetic available for metabolism.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Like other halogenated inhalational anesthetics, sevoflurane induces anesthesia by binding to ligand-gated ion channels and blocking CNS neurotransmission. It has been suggested that inhaled anesthetics enhance inhibitory postsynaptic channel activity by binding GABA<sub>A</sub> and glycine receptors, and inhibit excitatory synaptic channel activity by binding nicotinic acetylcholine, serotonin, and glutamate receptors. Sevoflurane has an effect on several ionic currents, including the hyperpolarisation-activated cation current (I<sub>f</sub>), the T-type and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (I<sub>Ca, T</sub> and I<sub>Ca, L</sub>), the slowly activating delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> currents (I<sub>Ks</sub>), and the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange current (I<sub>NCX</sub>). This ability to modulate ion channel activity can also regulate cardiac excitability and contractility.",

However, its mechanism is still unclear. ...It has been reported that voltage-gated sodium channels have important roles in anesthetic mechanisms. Much attention has been paid to the effects of sevoflurane on voltage-dependent sodium channels. To elucidate this, /investigators/ examined the effects of sevoflurane on Na(v) 1.8, Na(v) 1.4, and Na(v) 1.7 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The effects of sevoflurane on Na(v) 1.8, Na(v) 1.4, and Na(v) 1.7 sodium channels were studied by an electrophysiology method using whole-cell, two-electrode voltage-clamp techniques in Xenopus oocytes. Sevoflurane at 1.0 mM inhibited the voltage-gated sodium channels Na(v)1.8, Na(v)1.4, and Na(v)1.7, but sevoflurane (0.5 mM) had little effect. This inhibitory effect of 1 mM sevoflurane was completely abolished by pretreatment with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I. Sevoflurane appears to have inhibitory effects on Na(v)1.8, Na(v)1.4, and Na(v) 1.7 by PKC pathways. However, these sodium channels might not be related to the clinical anesthetic effects of sevoflurane.",

Quadruplicate ex vivo human chorionic plate arterial rings were used in all studies. Series 1 and 2 examined the role of the K+ channel in sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation. Separate experiments examined whether tetraethylammonium, which blocks large conductance calcium activated K+ (KCa++) channels (Series 1A+B) or glibenclamide, which blocks the ATP sensitive K+ (KATP) channel (Series 2), modulated sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation. Series 3 - 5 examined the role of the Ca++ channel in sevoflurane induced vasodilation. Separate experiments examined whether verapamil, which blocks the sarcolemmal voltage-operated Ca++ channel (Series 3), SK&F 96365 an inhibitor of sarcolemmal voltage-independent Ca++ channels (Series 4A+B), or ryanodine an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++ channel (Series 5A+B), modulated sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation. Sevoflurane produced dose dependent vasodilatation of chorionic plate arterial rings in all studies. Prior blockade of the KCa++ and KATP channels augmented the vasodilator effects of sevoflurane. Furthermore, exposure of rings to sevoflurane in advance of TEA occluded the effects of TEA. Taken together, these findings suggest that sevoflurane blocks K+ channels. Blockade of the voltage-operated Ca++channels inhibited the vasodilator effects of sevoflurane. In contrast, blockade of the voltage-independent and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++channels did not alter sevoflurane vasodilation. Sevoflurane appears to block chorionic arterial KCa++ and KATP channels. Sevoflurane also blocks voltage-operated calcium channels, and exerts a net vasodilatory effect in the in vitro feto-placental circulation.",

However, little is known about the mechanism. In this study, /investigators/ tested the hypothesis that sevoflurane postconditioning induces neuroprotection through the up-regulation hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) involving phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. In the first experiment, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to focal cerebral ischemia. Postconditioning was performed by exposure to 2.5% sevoflurane immediately at the onset of reperfusion. The mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1 alpha and its target gene, HO-1, intact neurons and the activity of caspase-3 was evaluated at 6, 24 and 72 hr after reperfusion. In the second experiment, ... the relationship between PI3K/Akt pathway and the expression of HIF-1alpha and HO-1 in the neuroprotection induced by sevoflurane /was investigated/. Cerebral infarct volume, apoptotic neuron and the expression of HIF-1alpha, HO-1 and p-Akt were evaluated at 24hr after reperfusion. Compared with the control group, sevoflurane postconditiong significantly ameliorated neuronal injury, up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of HIF-1 alpha and HO-1, inhibited the activity of caspase-3, and decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells and infarct sizes. However, the selective PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin not only partly eliminated the neuroprotection of sevoflurane as shown by reducing infarct size and apoptotic neuronal cells, but also reversed the elevation of HIF-1 alpha, HO-1 and p-Akt expression in the ischemic penumbra induced by sevoflurane. Therefore, /the/ data demonstrates that the cerebral protection from sevoflurane postconditioning is partly mediated by PI3K/Akt pathway via the up-regulation of HIF-1 alpha and HO-1.",

However, the effects of sevoflurane on mu-opioid receptor (uOR) functions is still unclear. In this study, the effects of sevoflurane on uOR functions were analyzed by using Xenopus oocytes expressing a uOR fused to chimeric G alpha protein G(qi5) (uOR-G(qi5)). Sevoflurane by itself did not elicit any currents in oocytes expressing uOR-G(qi5), whereas sevoflurane inhibited the [D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO)-induced Cl(-) currents at clinically used concentrations. Sevoflurane did not affect the Cl(-) currents induced by AlF(4)(-), which directly led to activation of G proteins. The inhibitory effects of sevoflurane on the DAMGO-induced currents were not observed in oocytes pretreated with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF109203X. These findings suggest that sevoflurane would inhibit uOR function. Further, the mechanism of inhibition by sevoflurane would be mediated by PKC.",

This method requires no modification of plasma and the working environment does not interfere with the determination of these analytes. The method allows simultaneous quantification of non-polar sevoflurane and its polar metabolite hexafluoroisopropanol (free, unconjugated form). It is characterized by high repeatability and sensitivity with the detection limit of 0.009 mg L(-1) for sevoflurane and 0.018 mg L(-1) for hexafluoroisopropanol and the linear range 0.050-150 mg L(-1). The method was used to determine the concentration of sevoflurane and hexafluoroisopropanol in plasma samples of 7 patients undergoing  general anesthesia with sevoflurane. The average concentration of sevoflurane and free hexafluoroisopropanol was 57.2 mg L(-1) and 0.39 mg L(-1), respectively. The method can be applied for clinical monitoring, as well as for analytical toxicology.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Appearance of ALT levels above 10 times the upper limit of normal, however, is distinctly unusual and points to significant hepatotoxicity. Clinically apparent, severe hepatic injury from sevoflurane is very rare, only isolated case reports having been published. The injury is marked by acute elevations in serum aminotransferase levels (5- to 50-fold) and appearance of jaundice within 2 to 21 days of surgery. There are usually minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase levels. Jaundice is usually preceded by a day or two of fever and may be accompanied by rash and eosinophilia. The acute liver injury may be self-limited and resolve within 4 to 8 weeks, but can be severe and associated with acute liver failure. A strong risk factor is previous exposure to any of the halogenated anesthetics and particularly a history of halothane hepatitis or unexplained fever and rash after anesthesia with one of these agents. The differential diagnosis of acute liver injury after surgery and anesthesia is sometimes difficult, and a clinical picture similar to sevoflurane induced hepatitis can be caused by shock or ischemia, sepsis, other idiosyncratic forms of drug induced liver injury and acute viral or herpes hepatitis.",

Because the serum half-life of sevoflurane in the mother short and the drug is not expected to be absorbed by the infant, no waiting period or discarding of milk is required. Breastfeeding can be resumed as soon as the mother has recovered sufficiently from general anesthesia to nurse. When a combination of anesthetic agents is used for a procedure, follow the recommendations for the most problematic medication used during the procedure. General anesthesia for cesarean section using sevoflurane as a component may delay the onset of lactation. In one study, breastfeeding before general anesthesia induction reduced requirements of sevoflurane and propofol compared to those of nursing mothers whose breastfeeding was withheld or nonnursing women.",

After delivery, patients in all groups received an infusion of oxytocin 30 international units in 1 L of saline, and 0.2 mg of methylergonovine if they were not hypertensive. Fentanyl 1 to 1.5 mcg/kg was administered after delivery to the general anesthesia group.

When used to supplement alfentanil-N2O anesthesia, sevoflurane and isoflurane equally potentiate neuromuscular block induced with pancuronium, vecuronium or atracurium. Therefore, during sevoflurane anesthesia, the dosage adjustments for these muscle relaxants are similar to those required with isoflurane. Potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents requires equilibration of muscle with delivered partial pressure of sevoflurane. Reduced doses of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation.",

Dogs were anesthetized with sevoflurane on two occasions, 1 week apart, and baseline MAC(BAR) (B-MAC(BAR)) was determined on each occasion. MAC(BAR) was defined as the mean of the end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations that prevented and allowed an increase (>/=15%) in heart rate or invasive mean arterial pressure in response to a noxious electrical stimulus (50 V, 50 Hz, 10 ms). Dogs then randomly received either a low-dose (LDS) or high-dose series (HDS) of ketamine, and treatment MAC(BAR) (T-MAC(BAR)) was determined. The LDS had an initial loading dose (LD) of 0.5 mg kg(-1) and constant rate infusion (CRI) at 6.25 ug kg(-1) minute(-1), followed, after T-MAC(BAR) determination, by a second LD (1 mg kg(-1)) and CRI (12.5 ug kg(-1) minute(-1)). The HDS had an initial LD (2 mg kg(-1)) and CRI (25 ug kg(-1) minute(-1)) followed by a second LD (3 mg kg(-1)) and CRI (50 ug kg(-1) minute(-1)). Data were analyzed with a mixed-model anova and are presented as Least squares mean (LSM) +/- standard error of the mean (SEM). The B-MAC(BAR) was not significantly different between treatments. Ketamine at 12.5, 25, and 50 ug kg(-1) minute(-1) decreased sevoflurane MAC(BAR), and the maximal decrease (22%) occurred at 12.5 ug kg(-1) minute(-1). The percentage change in MAC(BAR) was not correlated with either the log plasma ketamine or norketamine concentration. Ketamine at clinically relevant doses of 12.5, 25, and 50 ug kg(-1) minute(-1) decreased sevoflurane MAC(BAR), although the reduction was neither dose-dependent nor linear.",

In order to test whether a combination of cholinergic antagonists with general anesthetics improves their potency, ...the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of atropine on sevoflurane potency in cortical and spinal slice cultures during cholinergic overstimulation /were investigated/. As the spinal cord and neocortex are important substrates for general anesthetics cultured spinal and cortical tissue slices were obtained from embryonic and newborn mice, respectively. Drug effects were assessed by extracellular voltage recordings of spontaneous action potential activity. Application of acetylcholine elevated spontaneous activity in neocortical and spinal slices. Atropine (10 nM) reduced discharge rates and reversed the increase of spontaneous activity induced by acetylcholine. In the presence of acetylcholine and atropine sevoflurane caused a concentration-dependent decrease of neuronal activity in neocortical (EC(50)=0.35+/-0.33 MAC) and spinal slices (EC(50)=0.43+/-0.03 MAC). .../It was/ concluded that small concentrations of atropine increase sevoflurane potency in cortical networks during cholinergic overstimulation. ...",

In the present study, blood samples were analyzed to evaluate if the increased clinical motor responses to surgery in patients subjected to EA under sevoflurane anesthesia are also reflected in higher plasma levels of catecholamines, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), or cortisol. Blood samples were obtained before anesthetic induction, soon after the study or control procedures had been completed under general anesthesia, and after 30 minutes of surgery under steady-state anesthesia with 1.8% of sevoflurane, in 45 healthy female patients, scheduled for sterilization by laparoscopy, randomized for bilateral 2 Hz-burst EA (study group; n = 22) or control (control group; n = 23) procedures. Plasma levels of adrenaline were found to approach the higher preanesthetic level after 30 minutes of surgery in patients given EA stimulation but to remain low in control patients (P < 0.05)-in agreement with the stronger clinical motor responses to skin incision in the EA group. Plasma levels of noradrenaline, ACTH, and cortisol did not change in or differ between the two groups. The clinical facilitation of both cranial and spinal motor responses to surgery in patients given acupuncture under sevoflurane anesthesia is associated with increased plasma levels of adrenaline, possibly reflecting sympathetic activation.",

However, the depressant effects on motoneurons could be counterbalanced by presynaptic effects that inhibit the depressant pathways. /In this study, the authors/ investigated the effect of sevoflurane on a disynaptic inhibitory pathway onto motoneurons in a human reflex model. The study was performed with 9 volunteers receiving sevoflurane anesthesia (end tidal: 0.8% sevoflurane). Reciprocal inhibition was estimated from the depression of the H-reflex following a conditioning stimulation of the muscle spindle afferents from the tibialis anterior muscle. Measurements were performed before, during and after drug administration. The inhibition (mean +/- SE) amounted to 15.4% +/- 6.8%, 1.9% +/- 4.2% and 15.7% +/- 8.8% for measurements before, during and after sevoflurane administration, respectively. Differences between the anesthetic state and the two controls were statistically significant (mixed-effect ANOVA, p<0.01). Sevoflurane reduces reciprocal Ia-inhibition on motoneurons in humans. These findings seem to contradict the accepted view that sevoflurane enhances inhibitory synaptic transmission. This contradiction might be explained by the inhibitory actions of sevoflurane within the disynaptic pathway prior to the final glycinergic transmission onto the motoneuron. ...Results suggest that even in presumably simple pathways, postsynaptic effects of anesthetics could be superimposed by their presynaptic effects.",

Thirty dogs were mask-induced with sevoflurane, USP using anesthetic regimens that included various premedicants. During the clinical study, one hundred sixty-six dogs received sevoflurane, USP maintenance anesthesia as part of several anesthetic regimens that used injectable induction agents and various premedicants. The duration of anesthesia and the choice of anesthetic regimens were dependent upon the procedures that were performed. Duration of anesthesia ranged from 16 to 424 minutes among the individual dogs. Sevoflurane, USP vaporizer concentrations during the first 30 minutes of maintenance anesthesia were similar among the various anesthetic regimens. The quality of maintenance anesthesia was considered good or excellent in 169 out of 196 dogs. During the clinical trial, when a barbiturate was used for induction, the times to extubation, sternal recumbency and standing recovery were longer for dogs that received anesthetic regimens containing two preanesthetics compared to regimens containing one preanesthetic. Recovery times were shorter when anesthetic regimens used sevoflurane, USP or propofol for induction. The quality of recovery was considered good or excellent in 184 out of 196 dogs. Anesthetic regimen drug dosages, physiological responses, and the quality of induction, maintenance and recovery were comparable between 10 sighthounds and other breeds evaluated in the study. During the clinical study there was no indication of prolonged recovery times in the sighthounds.",

The authors investigated whether exposure of neonatal mice to inhaled sevoflurane causes deficits in social behavior as well as learning disabilities. Six-day-old C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 6 hr. Activated cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemical staining was used for detection of apoptosis. Cognitive functions were tested by pavlovian conditioned fear test. Social behavior was tested by social recognition and interaction tests. Neonatal exposure to sevoflurane significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells in the brain immediately after anesthesia. It caused persistent learning deficits later in adulthood as evidenced by decreased freezing response in both contextual and cued fear conditioning. The social recognition test demonstrated that mice with neonatal exposure to sevoflurane did not develop social memory. Furthermore, these mice showed decreased interactions with a social target compared with controls in the social interaction test, indicating a social interaction deficit. The authors did not attribute these abnormalities in social behavior to impairments of general interest in novelty or olfactory sensation, because they did not detect significant differences in the test for novel inanimate object interaction or for olfaction. This study shows that exposure of neonatal mice to inhaled sevoflurane could cause not only learning deficits but also abnormal social behaviors resembling autism spectrum disorder.",

Six hours after exposure, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to determine the morphological changes in the hippocampus. The expression levels of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and caspase-3 in the hippocampus of the pups were determined by immunofluorescence. A single 6-hr sevoflurane exposure at P7 caused morphological changes in the hippocampus. Sevoflurane also significantly increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and reduced the expression of the nNOS protein. These results indicate that neonatal exposure to sevoflurane causes neurohistopathological changes, apoptosis and decreases nNOS protein levels in the rat hippocampus.",

The birds were anesthetized by face mask with isoflurane for brachial artery catheterization. After recovery, anesthesia was re-induced with 6% SEV via face mask. After induction, a noncuffed endotracheal tube was placed and anesthesia was maintained with SEV (3.5% end-tidal) in oxygen (1 L/min) using an Ayre's T-piece nonrebreathing circuit, with spontaneous ventilation. Electrocardiography (ECG), direct systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure (SAP, DAP, and MAP), respiratory rate (f(R)), end-tidal carbon dioxide (Pe'CO(2)), and cloacal temperature (T \u00b0C) were measured before induction (baseline - under physical restraint) and after 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 minutes of SEV anesthesia. Arterial blood samples were collected for gas analysis at baseline and then at 10, 25 and 40 minutes. No ventricular arrhythmias were observed in the present study. Respiratory rate, SAP, DAP, MAP, T \u00b0C and pH decreased from pre-induction values, while arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, bicarbonate concentration, and Pe'CO(2) were significantly higher than baseline.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 193 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates sevoflurane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase sevoflurane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 220 days. Sevoflurane absorbs light at wavelengths <200 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, sevoflurane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 270. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-1 atm-cu m/mole. Sevoflurane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, sevoflurane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to sevoflurane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where sevoflurane is produced or administered. Exposure to sevoflurane among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug, an anaesthetic. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

All waste anesthetic gases (WAGs) particularly, halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane contain chlorine and are believed to have significant ozone-depleting potential. The stability of the molecules of halogenated inhalational anesthetics permits their passage to the stratosphere, where solar ultraviolet radiation dissociates these molecules to liberate free chlorine, which acts as a catalyst in the breakdown of ozone and destruction of the ozone layer. ... Halogenated inhalational anesthetics strongly absorb the reflected infrared spectrum of the outgoing terrestrial radiation. Their present contribution to climate change is negligible in comparison to that attributable to carbon dioxide as their atmospheric concentrations are negligible. However, as they are stable compounds, their cumulative impact will possibly become significant enough to force climate change. Although, the current climate effects of anesthetics are small and clinical decisions about the effectiveness of different compounds should take priority, there is a need to monitor their climate impact. Anesthesiologists, surgeons, scrub nurses, and operating room technicians spend considerable time in the operation theater (OT). The pollution inside this closed space may not be measurable but the long term effect of WAG in the environment has always been a concern. Health and the safety of service providers are of paramount importance to any health system. The increasing popularity of \"Low-flow Anesthesia\" has possibly reduced the pollution in this closed space but in the absence of effective scavenging systems, there is a need to relook into the impact of WAG.",

It is based on: (1) the TF-IDF, adapted to chemical structures, (2) location information in the text (e.g. title, abstract, keywords), and (3) the document size.  Springer Nature aims to provide only highly qualitative and relevant content but references of lower relevance aren't withheld as they might contain also very useful information.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

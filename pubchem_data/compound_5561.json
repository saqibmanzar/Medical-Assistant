Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

Flush the eyes immediately with water for about 5-10 min by tilting the head to the side, pulling eyelids apart with fingers, and pouring water slowly into eyes. Do not cover eyes with bandages. If exposure to liquid agent is suspected, cut and remove all clothing and wash skin immediately with soap and water. If shower areas are available, showering with water alone will be adequate. However, in those cases where water is in short supply, and showers are not available, an alternative form of decontamination is to use 05% sodium hypochlorite solution or absorbent powders such as fluor, talcum powder, or Fuller's earth. If exposure to vapor only is certain, remove outer clothing and wash exposed areas with soap and water or 0.5% solution of sodium hypochlorite. Place contaminated clothes and personal belongings in a seal double bag. In cases of ingestion, DO NOT INDUCE EMESIS. There is no evidence that administration of activated charcoal is beneficial. ...If the victim is alert and able to swallow, give 4 to 8 ounces of milk or water to drink. /Nitrogen mustards/",

A group of patients, including 14 children and teenagers, exposed to mustard gas were studied. Laboratory tests including blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, urine analysis, etc., were determined. Among the most frequent disorders were facial involvement (78%), which dominated the clinical picture, followed by genital (42%), truncal, and axillary lesions (both 14%). Eosinophilia was the most prominent laboratory disorder seen in 12% of the patients. Skin lesions started 4-18 hours after exposure. Erythema developed within 20-30 hours after exposure, followed by blisters. The time of onset of manifestations had been shorter and severity of the lesions higher in children and teenagers compared with adults. Both phenomena could be attributed to the more delicate skin of the young patients. Genital manifestations were less frequent in this subgroup while ophthalmic, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal lesions were more frequently encountered in children than in adults. /Unspecified mustard gas/"

These 14 survived from 284-580 days. At autopsy, among the 10 injected with HN2, there were 3 lung carcinomas, 1 lung adenoma, and 1 with \"early bronchogenic tumors:. ONe animal had a liver lymphosarcoma and another had a uterine fibromyoma. Three were free of tumors. Among the 4 administered HN3, there were 2 lung carcinomas and 1 lung adenoma. One of the animals with carcinoma also had a spindle-celled sarcoma at the site of injection. Substantial other non- or premalignant pathology was described in all of the treated animals. Of 40 untreated mice sacrificed between 14 and 18 months of age, 6 had lung adenomas and 2 hepatomas.

Although several of the nitrogen mustards have medicinal uses as antineoplastic agents, tris(2-chloroethyl)amine does not appear to be currently used in the United States. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.011 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tris(2-chloroethyl)amine will exist solely in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase tris(2-chloroethyl)amine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.5 days. If released to soil, tris(2-chloroethyl)amine is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 672. Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine has a pKa of 4.64 and is expected to exist in both the protonated form and neutral species in the ambient environment. At neutral to alkaline conditions, the neutral species will be the dominant form of tris(2-chloroethyl)amine, but under acidic conditions the protonated form may also exist. The protonated form of tris(2-chloroethyl)amine will adsorb to soil surfaces more than the neutral species. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.85X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. The protonated form of tris(2-chloroethyl)amine will not volatilize from water or moist soil surfaces. Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine was reported to hydrolyze slowly for a nitrogen mustard, but under alkaline conditions approximately 90-95% degradation was observed after 24 hours. Therefore, hydrolysis will be an important fate process in moist soils and water surfaces. If released into water, tris(2-chloroethyl)amine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 47 hours and 26 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low, and hydrolysis should preclude bioconcentration from being a major fate process. Due to the high toxicity of this compound, strict safeguards are employed to control the release of tris(2-chloroethyl)amine. Therefore, the general population will not be exposed to this compound and occupational exposure via dermal and inhalation routes are not likely. (SRC)",

Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine has a pKa of 4.64(4) and is expected to exist primarily as the neutral species under neutral or alkaline conditions, but the protonated form will be present under acidic conditions. The protonated form of tris(2-chloroethyl)amine is expected to adsorb to soil surfaces more strongly than the neutral species(SRC). Volatilization of the neutral species of tris(2-chloroethyl)amine from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.85X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 0.011 mm Hg(3), and water solubility, 160 mg/l(3). The protonated form of tris(2-chloroethyl)amine will not volatilize from moist soil surfaces since cations do not volatilize(SRC). Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(3). Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine was reported to hydrolyze slowly for a nitrogen mustard(5,6), but under alkaline conditions approximately 90-95% degradation was observed after 24 hours(5). Therefore, hydrolysis will be an important environmental fate process in moist soil surfaces.",

Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine has a pKa of 4.64(3)and is expected to exist primarily as the neutral species in aquatic systems, however under acidic conditions the protonated form may also be present. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.85X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.011 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 160 mg/l(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 46 hours and 26 days, respectively(SRC). The protonated form of tris(2-chloroethyl)amine will not volatilize from water surfaces since cations do not volatilize(SRC). Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine was reported to hydrolyze slowly for a nitrogen mustard(5,6), but under alkaline conditions approximately 90-95% degradation was observed after 24 hours(5). Therefore, hydrolysis will be an important environmental fate process in water. According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 11(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.27(8) and a regression-derived equation(9) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Furthermore, hydrolysis should preclude the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that the neutral species of tris(2-chloroethyl)amine is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life of the neutral species from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 47 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life of the neutral species from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 26 days(SRC). Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine's estimated Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine has a pKa of 4.64(3) and will exist primarily as the neutral species under neutral to basic conditions, but the protonated form of tris(2-chloroethyl)amine, may also be present under acidic environments. The protonated form of tris(2-chloroethyl)amine will not volatilize from water or moist soil surfaces(SRC). Tris(2-chloroethyl)amine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

It has also been used for Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome and opioid withdrawal. Some brand names for guanfacine are Intuniv\u00ae and Tenex\u00ae.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy. If you have been taking this medication regularly, you should not stop taking it suddenly. If you do plan to stop this medication, it should be stopped slowly under the care of your healthcare provider.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

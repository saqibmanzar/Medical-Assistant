When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The animals were sacrificed on day 20 of pregnancy. Significant differences between high-dose level and control dams were observed in the following: increased clinical observations such as irritability, hunched posture, walking on toes, piloerection and peri-orbital staining, and increased mortality (3/35 animals), decreased body weight gain, decreased levels of creatinine, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, and increased white cell count. Significant differences between high-dose level and control litter parameters were observed in the following: increased incidence of embryo-fetal deaths (primarily early in pregnancy), decrease in litter size and weight, increased incidence of defects including anophthalmia/microphthalmia, ventricular septal defects, defects/irregularities affecting thorax, and/or kinky tail, defects of the thoracic ribs and occurrence of cervical rib(s). No significant differences between treated and control animals were observed in the following: relative liver and kidney weights, or pregnancy rates. No significant differences between mid- and low-dose level and control groups were observed with respect to maternal toxicity or litter parameters, although a small, dose-dependent increase in some of the morphological parameters was observed in the fetuses of the mid-dose level group.",

It is a natural product being found in many plants and foods. 2-Phenylethanol has a low adsorptivity to soil and if released on soil, may leach. Limited data indicate that it is readily biodegradable in screening tests and may therefore biodegrade in soil. If released in water, little 2-phenylethanol will be lost by volatilization as its volatilization half-life in a model river is estimated to be 45 days. As in soil, it would be expected to biodegrade. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms should not be important. In the atmosphere, 2-phenylethanol will react with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals resulting in an estimated half-life of 1.6 days. It is fairly soluble in water and therefore may be washed out of the atmosphere by rain. Workplace exposure to a 2-phenylethanol may be by inhalation or dermal contact. 2-Phenylethanol is an essential oil, naturally occurring in many plants and foods and used extensively as a fragrance and therefore the general population may be exposed to 2-phenylethanol in food and in consumer products such as perfumes, soaps, and detergents.

Vapor-phase 2-phenylethanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.6 days(1,SRC). 2-Phenylethanol solubility in water is 16,000 mg/L(4), and therefore it may be washed out of the atmosphere by rain(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It is currently the only specific and effective treatment for malignant hyperthermia. In isolated nerve-muscle preparation, Dantrium has been shown to produce relaxation by affecting the contractile response of the muscle at a site beyond the myoneural junction. In skeletal muscle, Dantrium dissociates excitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In the anesthetic-induced malignant hyperthermia syndrome, evidence points to an intrinsic abnormality of skeletal muscle tissue. In selected humans, it has been postulated that &ldquo;triggering agents&rdquo; (e.g.,general anesthetics and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents) produce a change within the cell which results in an elevated myoplasmic calcium. This elevated myoplasmic calcium activates acute cellular catabolic processes that cascade to the malignant hyperthermia crisis. It is hypothesized that addition of Dantrium to the &ldquo;triggered&rdquo; malignant hyperthermic muscle cell reestablishes a normal level of ionized calcium in the myoplasm.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The liver injury can be severe; cases of acute liver failure and even death have been described (Case 1). The latency to onset of clinically apparent liver injury ranges from one week to several months, but is usually within the first 6 months of starting therapy (Case 2). More serious cases are associated with a sudden onset with jaundice, nausea and fatigue, and rapid progression. Allergic manifestations such as fever, rash and eosinophilia are rare, as are autoimmune features. The pattern of enzyme elevations is predominantly hepatocellular. Liver histology demonstrates an acute-hepatitis like picture. Recovery is usually complete within 1 to 3 months. Women, the elderly, and patients taking higher doses appear to be more susceptible to developing dantrolene hepatotoxicity.",

A drug's efficiency may be affected by the degree to which it binds to plasma proteins. The less bound a drug is, the more efficiently it can traverse cell membranes or diffuse.",

Similar to other bisphosphonates, alendronate has a high affinity for bone mineral and is taken up during osteoclast resorption. Alendronate inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase, one of the enzymes in the mevalonic acid pathway involved in producing isoprenoid compounds that are essential for post-translational modification of small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, such as Rho, Ras and Rab. Inhibition of this process interferes with osteoclast function and survival. Alendronate is used for the treatment of osteoporosis and Paget's disease. ",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

In some cases these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue alendronate sodium and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive (3)H-alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after (3)H-alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.",

It is a third-generation bisphosphonate compound, specifically distributed on the surface of bone resorption and taken into osteoclasts. Under the closed circumstances which is formed with osteoclast and the bone surface, alendronate becomes detached from the bone surface and taken into osteoclast since acid released from osteoclast leads to pH decrease (acidified). The uptaken alendronate blocks the pathway of mevalonic acid synthesis, which is cholesteric synthesis, inhibits the prenylation of GTP binding protein, and decreases the osteoclast's function by influencing the cytoskeleton. This restraint of alendronate in bone resorption against osteoclasts is reversible, showing no cytotoxicity at more than hundredfold concentration level at which action occurs. ...",

The classical pharmacological effects of bisphosphonates (BPs) appear to be the result of two key properties: their affinity for bone mineral and their inhibitory effects on osteoclasts. There is new information about both properties. Mineral binding affinities differ among the clinically used BPs and may influence their differential distribution within bone, their biological potency, and their duration of action. The antiresorptive effects of the nitrogen-containing BPs (including alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronate) appear to result from their inhibition of the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) in osteoclasts. FPPS is a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, which generates isoprenoid lipids utilized for the post-translational modification of small GTP-binding proteins that are essential for osteoclast function. Effects on other cellular targets, such as osteocytes, may also be important. BPs share several common properties as a drug class. However, as with other families of drugs, there are obvious chemical, biochemical, and pharmacological differences among the individual BPs. Each BP has a unique profile that may help to explain potential clinical differences among them, in terms of their speed and duration of action, and effects on fracture reduction.",

Alendronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether alendronate and naproxen are synergistic as causes of gastric ulcers. /Investigaors/ performed an endoscopist-blind, randomized, crossover, single-center comparison of 10 mg/d of alendronate sodium, 500 mg of naproxen sodium twice daily, or the combination taken orally for 10 days in volunteers aged 30 years or older. Videoendoscopy was used to evaluate the presence and degree of mucosal damage to the esophagus, stomach, or duodenal bulb before and after each treatment. There was a 1- to 4-week washout between evaluations. Twenty-six healthy volunteers participated (18 women and 8 men), aged 30 to 50 years. Gastric ulcers were present in 2 subjects receiving alendronate (8%), in 3 receiving naproxen (12%), and in 10 receiving both (38%) (P<0.05 for the combination vs either drug alone). Both alendronate and naproxen can cause gastric ulcers. The combination appears synergistic. Alendronate should be used with caution in those who simultaneously require nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.9X10-13 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates alendronic acid will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase alendronic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Alendronic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, alendronic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. The pKa values of alendronic acid are pKa1 2.72, pKa2 8.73, pKa3 10.5 and pKa4 11.6, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Alendronic acid may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, alendronic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The pKa values indicate alendronic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to alendronic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where alendronic acid is produced or used. Exposure to alendronic acid among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug Fosamax, a bone resorption inhibitor. (SRC)",

The pKa values of alendronic acid are pKa1 2.72, pKa2 8.73, pKa3 10.5 and pKa4 11.6(3) indicate alendronic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 5(SRC), from an estiamted log Kow of -0.50(5) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2011).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

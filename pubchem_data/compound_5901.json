                        "Description": "A chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols and numbers. PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The compound was absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract, in contrast to free 6-azauridine. Significant blood levels of 6-azauridine were maintained during the 8-hour period intervening between doses of the acetylated derivative. Depression of the conversion of orotic acid to uridine nucleotides was demonstrated in patients undergoing therapy, by studies of the fate of intravenously injected orotic acid-7-C14 and of the urinary excretion of orotidine and orotic acid. The metabolic effects and clinical changes observed were comparable to those produced by equivalent doses of intravenously administered 6-azauridine. /2',3',5'-Triacetyl-6-azauridine/",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Prior work indicated that several AzUrd-sensitive viruses induced an increase in the level of uridine kinase, and this might explain the selective activity of AzUrd on such viruses. Present studies compared AzUrd sensitive and resistant viruses with respect to their orotic acid pathways by labeling cells with [14C]-orotic acid during the latent period of viral infection. No differences were detected by this method with either vaccinia, Newcastle disease, or vesicular stomatitis viruses. AzUrd inhibits transport of orotic acid into the cell by 30%, while incorporation of orotic acid into cellular RNA is inhibited by 50% (taking into consideration the 30% already noted) when the highest concentration of antimetabolite is used. This suggests that, in addition to blocking orotidylic acid decarboxylase, AzUrd may act on some other site (sites) of action in the inhibition of virus multiplication.",

In each of the three experiments the animals were admin by gavage: Group 1 (Control), drinking water; Group 2, 6-AzUrd-TA; and Group 3, 6-AzUrd-TA with pyridoxine. While no beta-alanine was found in the control group or in pretreatment samples of the 6-AzUrd-Ta and 6-AzUrd-TA plus pyridoxine treated animals, high concn of this amino acid (191.0 + or - 91.6, 220.2 + or - 116.3, 103.2 + or - 64.4 nmol/ml) were found on the fourth and seventh days of 6-AzUrd-TA treatment with daily doses of 1.0 g/kg and 0.5 g/kg body weight, respectively. The drug induced hyper beta-alaninemia was significantly (p < or = 0.05) reduced in all three experiments by simultaneous pyridoxine admin in daily doses of 50 mg/kg body weight. These results indicate that daily repeated oral admin of 6-AzUrd-Ta causes elevation of serum beta-alanine, which can be partially prevented by oral admin of pyridoxine. They also indirectly support the hypothesis that 6-AzUrd-TA induced hyper beta-alaninemia is at least partially caused by the inhibition of beta-alanine degrading enzymes, that use pyridoxal phosphate as a coenzyme. /6-Azauridine triacetate/",

The inhibitory effect of the combination of AzUrd and adenine derivatives was reversible by guanosine, uridine and cytidine but not by orotic acid or orotidylic acid.",

Considering the sensitivity peaks of the morphogenetic processes which were observed, the dose-response relationships, the transformation of the teratogenic to a lethal effect and critical period extension with increasing doses, it was found that the effects of ia and im administered 6-azauridine did not differ. It was concluded that ia administered 6-azauridine had direct effect on embryonic morphogenetic processes and that this, too, was the essential mechanism of embryotoxicity of im administered 6-azauridine. The value of the intraamniotic technique for establishing the direct embryotoxic effect is discussed.",

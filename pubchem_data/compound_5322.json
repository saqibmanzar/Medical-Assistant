The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections.  Sulfacytine is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. It inhibits bacterial synthesis of of dihydrofolic acid by preventing the condensation of the pteridine with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid.",

Sulfacytine competes with PABA for the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, thereby preventing the incorporation of PABA into dihydrofolic acid, the immediate precursor of folic acid. This leads to an inhibition of bacterial folic acid synthesis and de novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, ultimately resulting in cell growth arrest and cell death.",

Cross-resistance between sulfonamides is the general rule. Resistance does emerge gradually and is widespread in many animal populations; continued use of sulfonamides increases the incidence. Plasmid-mediated sulfonamide resistance in intestinal gram-negative bacteria is often linked with ampicillin and tetracycline resistance.",

The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.",

The N4-acetyl metabolites, which do not possess antibacterial activity, have greater affinity for plasma albumin than does the nonacetylated drug and are usually less soluble than the parent sulfonamide, particularly in acidic urine. Like acetyl derivatives, glucuronide derivatives do not possess antibacterial activity; however, glucuronide derivatives are water soluble, appear to resemble the nonacetylated sulfonamide in plasma binding capacity, and have not been associated with adverse effects. /Sulfonamides/",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Sulfonamides interfere with the utilization of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid (the reduced form of folic acid) cofactors in susceptible bacteria. Sulfonamides are structural analogs of PABA and appear to interfere with PABA utilization by competitively inhibiting the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, which catalyzes the formation of dihydropteroic acid (a precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid) from PABA and pteridine; however, other mechanism(s) affecting the biosynthetic pathway also may be involved. Compounds such as pyrimethamine and trimethoprim, which block later stages in the synthesis of folic acid, act synergistically with sulfonamides. Only microorganisms that synthesize their own folic acid are inhibited by sulfonamides; animal cells and bacteria which are capable of utilizing folic acid precursors or preformed folic acid are not affected by these drugs. The antibacterial activity of the sulfonamides is reportedly decreased in the presence of blood or purulent body exudates. /Sulfonamides/",

Because dihydrofolate synthesis is reduced, the levels of tetrahydrofolate (folinic acid) formed from dihydrofolate diminish. Tetrahydrofolate is an essential component of the coenzymes responsible for single carbon metabolism in cells. Acting as antimetabolites to PABA, sulfonamides eventually block, in a complex fashion, several enzymes. These enzymes include those needed for the biogenesis of purine bases; for the transfer of desoxyuridine to thymidine; and for the biosynthesis of methionine, glycine, and formylmethionyl-transfer-RNA. This results in suppression of protein synthesis, impairment of metabolic processes, and inhibition of growth and multiplication of those organisms that cannot use preformed folate. The effect is bacteriostatic, although a bactericidal action is evident at the high concentrations that may be found in urine.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Similar to acetylcholine, it binds to cholinergic receptors of the motor endplate to induce membrane depolarization and, eventually, muscle paralysis, which may be maintained for as long as an adequate concentration of succinylcholine remains at the receptor site. Succinylcholine has no direct action on smooth or cardiac muscle, nor does it appear to act on pre-synaptic or ganglionic acetylcholine receptors. The paralysis induced by succinylcholine has been described as \"progressive\", first involving the muscles of the face and glottis, then the intercostals and diaphragm, then followed by other skeletal muscles.  Succinylcholine has no effect on consciousness or pain threshold, and must therefore be used in conjunction with adequate anesthesia. There have been rare reports of the development of acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia - resulting in ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death - after the intravenous administration of succinylcholine to apparently healthy pediatric patients who were subsequently found to have undiagnosed skeletal myopathy (most frequently Duchenne's muscular dystrophy). Infants or children experiencing seemingly idiopathic cardiac arrest soon after the administration of succinylcholine should therefore be treated immediately for hyperkalemia. Given that patients may not present with any apparent risk factors, the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be restricted to emergency intubation or other situations in which a suitable alternative is unavailable.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Spinal anesthesia consisted of hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg and fentanyl 0.01 mg; epidural anesthesia consisted of isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% (0.5 mg per 10 cm height) and fentanyl 0.05 mg. General anesthesia consisted of propofol 2.3 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg for induction and intubation, followed by an anesthetic gas mixture and oxygen. Reportedly, nitric oxide (possibly nitrous oxide) was 50% of the gas before delivery and 67% after delivery. Sevoflurane was also used in some cases. After delivery and cord clamping, mothers received fentanyl 3 mcg/kg and rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg intravenously for placental delivery. After surgery, neuromuscular block reversal was performed with neostigmine and atropine. All patients received 1 mg/kg of diclofenac every 8 h for 24 hours after delivery and 98% of general anesthesia patients also received 100 mg of tramadol and 78.5% received acetaminophen 1 gram. No regional anesthesia patients received tramadol or acetaminophen. Patients receiving one of the regional anesthetic protocols established lactation sooner (56% and 29% after 18 and 24 hours, respectively), while 86% of women receiving general anesthesia did not establish lactation until 36 to 48 hours after surgery. It is not known what part succinylcholine played in this difference in outcome.",

Potent inhalation anesthetics and neuromuscular blocking agents should be avoided if possible in patients who have experienced malignant hyperthermia and in members of their families, and the possibility that this reaction could occur in any patient undergoing general anesthesia should be considered.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

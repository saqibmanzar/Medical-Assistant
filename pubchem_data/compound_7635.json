When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For massive fire, use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2024)",

Rats were dosed once daily, 5 days per week for 13 weeks. Treated rats were given octyl-acetate at doses of 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 g/kg. The results indicated that a low degree of toxicity is associated with subchronic oral exposures. marginal effects on body wight and food consumption were noted in the high dose group. Increased liver weight and mild nephropathy were also noted in high dose animals. However, they were thought to be of minimal toxicological significance. No evidence of significant systemic toxicity was noted in the mid or low dose groups. The increase in liver weight sin the absence of any evidence of microscopic pathology suggested that this was not a true toxic event, but rather a compensatory response... The growth of the liver in these cases was seen as a response to an increased functional load. The authors conclude that a low degree of toxicity is associated with subchronic oral exposure to octyl-acetate.",

Animals were necropsied on gestational day 20, and fetuses were removed and examined. Maternal rats in the high dose group showed reduced body weight from the ninth gestational day to the end of the study period. Dose dependent reduction in food consumption was noted, especially during gestation days six to nine. No significant differences were found between treated and control animals in resorptions, or fetal weight, viability, or malformation. An increased incidence of fetal malformation observed in the high dose groups was significant in terms of proportion of rats from the litters in this group which were malformed, and the number of litters with at least one malformed fetus. ... in rats, octyl-acetate is maternally toxic, and that, although some fetal malformation as found at the 1.0 g/kg dose, it is not a developmental toxicant.",

Based on a vapor pressure of 0.23 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C, 2-ethylhexyl acetate is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-ethylhexyl acetate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an atmospheric half-life of about 35 hours. 2-Ethylhexyl acetate is expected to have slight mobility in soils based upon an estimated Koc value of 2,500. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is expected based upon the vapor pressure of this compound. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is also expected based upon the estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-3 atm-cu m/mol. Although no biodegradation studies have been performed on 2-ethylhexyl acetate, studies on structurally similar compounds have shown that, in general, alkyl acetates are biodegradable. In water, 2-ethylhexyl acetate is expected to adsorb to sediment or particulate matter given its estimated Koc value. This compound is expected to volatilize from water surfaces given its Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 130 hours respectively. Hydrolysis is expected to occur slowly based upon estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 3 years and 122 days at pH 7 and 8 respectively. The potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is considered high based on an estimated BCF value 400. Occupational exposure may be through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-ethylhexyl acetate is produced or used as a solvent. The general population may be exposed to 2-ethylhexyl acetate through the ingestion of food sources. (SRC)",

Ethylhexyl acetate has been used as a high boiling solvent used to promote flow and retard blushing in lacquers, emulsions, and silk screen inks, and as a flow control agent in baking enamels(3). It can also be used as a dispersant for vinyl organosols and as a coalescing agent for latex paints(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

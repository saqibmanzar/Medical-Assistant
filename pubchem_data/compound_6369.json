Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Concentrations of vinylidene fluoride were measured in blood of /B6C3F1/ mice during 6 hr exposures to nominal concentrations of 250, 3750 or 15,000 ppm vinylidene fluoride. A physiological model developed to simulate blood levels of /this cmpd/ in rats was adapted for mice by incorporating physiologically realistic parameters for mice where appropriate ( alveolar ventilation, cardiac output, blood flow to organs, and organ volumes) and by assuming that chemical specific parameters such as tissue/blood partition coefficients determined for rats could also be applied to mice. Measured steady state levels of vinylidene fluoride in blood of mice increased with increasing exposure concn. For both the 15,000 and 3750 ppm vinylidene fluoride exposures, the experimentally determined data fell within the 95% confidence interval predicted by the physiological model. For the 250 ppm vinylidene fluoride exposure, the experimentally determined values /for this cmpd/ in blood were lower than what was predicted by the model. Model predictions indicated that for mice, as observed for rats, levels of vinylidene fluoride would rise very rapidly, reaching steady state within minutes of exposure, and that at the end of exposure, blood levels will decline rapidly. At the two lowest concn, ... no vinylidene fluoride /could be detected/ in blood taken 15 min or longer after cessation of exposure, suggesting that the post exposure levels were at or below the limit of detection which was 4 ug/vinylidene fluoride/ml blood. For the 15,000 ppm exposure vinylidene fluoride could be detected in blood up to 15 min post exposure.",

Hepatic microsomes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats, some of which had been pretreated with sodium phenobarbital or beta-naphthoflavone. These were incubated with 1,1-difluoroethene, 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethene, trifluoroethene or trifluorochloroethene. The effects of structure on fluoride release and cytochrome p450 and heme loss were investigated. Near maximal release of fluoride occurred in microsomes from phenobarbital treated rats. The greatest release occurred with 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethene, followed by trifluorochloroethene, trifluoroethene and 1,1-difluoroethene in that order. The amounts of fluoride released were 2.4 to 4 times that released from untreated microsomes. beta-Naphthoflavone caused a slight inhibition of fluoride release from all compounds, relative to microsomes from untreated rats. Trifluoroethene caused the greatest loss of cytochrome and heme from microsomes, followed by 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethene, trifluoroethene, and 1,1-difluoroethene in that order. /Results indicate/ that fluoroethenes and chloroethenes are cytochrome p450 substrates that effectively inactivate cytochrome p450 isozymes. The ability to undergo these reactions, however, depends on the degree and nature of their halogen substituents.",

Those substances designated with a (P) may polymerize explosively when heated or involved in a fire. Vapors from liquefied gas are initially heavier than air and spread along ground. Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket. (ERG, 2024)",

Specially trained personnel may use fog lines to cool exposures and let the fire burn itself out. Vapors are heavier than air and will collect in low areas. Vapors may travel long distances to ignition sources and flashback. Vapors in confined areas may explode when exposed to fire. Containers may explode in fire. Storage containers and parts of containers may rocket great distances, in many directions. If material or contaminated runoff enters waterways, notify downstream users of potentially contaminated waters. Notify local health and fire officials and pollution control agencies. From a secure, explosion-proof location, use water spray to cool exposed containers. If cooling streams are ineffective (venting sound increases in volume and pitch, tank discolors or shows any signs of deforming), withdraw immediately to a secure position.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3X10+4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1-difluoroethene will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase 1,1-difluoroethene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and with ozone; the half-life for these reactions in air are estimated to be 8 and 60 days, respectively. 1,1-Difluoroethene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,1-difluoroethene is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 32. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.4 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1-Difluoroethene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Insufficient data are available to predict the relative importance or rate of biodegradation in soil or water. If released into water, 1,1-difluoroethene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.3 hours and 3.2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,1-difluoroethene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1-difluoroethene is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

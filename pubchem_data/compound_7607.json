ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The information in this section includes OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs), American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values (TLVs), and any other exposure limit used or recommended by the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer preparing the safety data sheet, where available. In addition, this section contains information on appropriate engineering controls (e.g., use local exhaust ventilation, or use only in an enclosed system) as well as recommendations for personal protective measures to prevent illness or injury from exposure to chemicals, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., appropriate types of eye, face, skin or respiratory protection needed based on hazards and potential exposure).",

Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

In all cases RAST and/or skin-test investigations revealed the presence of IgE antibodies reacting specifically with HSA conjugated with those isocyanates to which workers were exposed as well as with other isocyanates with which they had not been in contact. By the RAST inhibition technique, moderate to strong mutual cross-reactivities between all tested isocyanate-HSA conjugates--even between aromatic and aliphatic ones--could be demonstrated in tests with five sera. The magnitudes of cross-reactivities differed, however, from one patient to another. One serum contained IgE antibodies that were almost completely specific to TDI-HSA; with this serum only weak cross-reactivities with other isocyanate conjugates could be demonstrated. These results indicate the predominance of closely related antigenic determinants in HSA conjugated with different isocyanates. The common antibody-binding regions are obviously recognized to different extents by antibodies of clinically sensitized workers, indicating individual differences in specificities and avidities of antibody populations. Nearly complete lack of IgE binding of ovalbumin-bound TDI in RAST and RAST inhibition indicates carrier-specific antigenicity of isocyanate-protein conjugates. In addition, since unmodified HSA did not bind IgE, antigenic determinants of the conjugates studied should be predominantly formed by the isocyanate-protein bond regions and concurrently by neighboring amino acid residues of the HSA molecule. /Isocyanates/",

These compounds are potent pulmonary sensitizers which cause bronchospasm, even in patients without prior airway hyperreactivity. Diisocyanate compounds act either as inducers of nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity or as direct pharmacologic agonists. Isocyanates apparently have the potential to sensitize certain segments of the population. Elevated humoral antibodies (ie, specific IgE antibodies to the p-tolyl determinant but not the diisocyanate conjugate) were detected in sensitized workers, but cell-mediated immunity also may produce hypersensitivity reactions. In the absence of renewed exposure, radioallergosorbent titers may not distinguish sensitive from nonsensitized workers. At high doses, toluene diisocyanate may act directly on bronchial mucosa by interfering with cholinergic and adrenergic mechanisms. /Isocyanates/",

An isocyanate-exposed worker may first develop an asthmatic condition (i.e., become sensitized) after a single (acute) exposure, but sensitization usually takes a few months to several years of exposure. The asthmatic reaction may occur minutes after exposure (immediate), several hours after exposure (late), or a combination of both immediate and late components after exposure (dual). The late asthmatic reaction is the most common, occurring in approximately 40% of isocyanate sensitized workers. After sensitization, any exposure, even to levels below an occupational exposure limit or standard, can produce an asthmatic response that may be life threatening. Experience with isocyanates has shown that monomeric, prepolymeric and polyisocyanate species are capable of producing respiratory sensitization in exposed workers. /Isocyanates/",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 0.08 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3,4-dichlorophenyl isocyanate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3,4-dichlorophenyl isocyanate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 24 days. 3,4-Dichlorophenyl isocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to moist soil, 3,4-dichlorophenyl isocyanate is not expected to leach or adsorb to solids nor volatilize due to its rapid degradation reaction with water. 3,4-Dichlorophenyl isocyanate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, 3,4-dichlorophenyl isocyanate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its rapid hydrolysis. Volatilization from water surfaces and bioconcentration are also not expected to be important fate processes due to rapid hydrolysis. Isocyanates hydrolyze readily in water to yield a carbamic acid. Occupational exposure to 3,4-dichlorophenyl isocyanate may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3,4-dichlorophenyl isocyanate is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 3,4-dichlorophenyl isocyanate via dermal contact with water containing 3,4-dichlorophenyl isocyanate. (SRC)",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 24 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Isocyanates hydrolyze readily in water to yield a carbamic acid, which decarboxylates to produce CO2 and an amine; the latter immediately reacts with more isocyanate to yield a disubstituted urea. The hydrolysis rate increases with electron-withdrawing substituents. Steric hindrance also influences hydrolysis rate; aliphatic isocyanate rates are: primary > secondary > tertiary(2). 3,4-Dichlorophenyl isocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3), and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Based on these effects, we therefore postulated the hypothesis that patients with acute bronchitis would also benefit from therapy with Cineole. As part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center-study, a total of 242 patients with confirmed acute bronchitis was randomly selected to participate. Over a period of 10 days, all patients were administered 3 x 200 mg of Cineole, or a respective placebo, per day. The primary outcome measure was a Bronchitis Sum Score, which summarizes the relevant symptoms of acute bronchitis. After 4 days of treatment it was notable, that the patient group treated with Cineole, showed significantly more improvements of the bronchitis-sum-score than those of the placebo group (p?=?0.0383). The statistical significant difference of the individual outcome measures was especially underlined by the frequency of cough fits by p?=?0.0001 after 4 days. The effects of Cineole in the treatment of acute bronchitis were clearly measurable and could be proven after a treatment period of merely 4 days. This study corroborates the fact that Cineole actively and significantly reduces cough frequency after four days. ...",

Baseline demographics, lung function and standard medication of both groups were comparable. During the treatment period of 6 months the multiple criteria frequency, severity and duration of exacerbations were significantly lower in the group treated with cineole in comparison to placebo.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

It has a history of being used as an expectorant and an antiseptic.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Cineole is the main constituent of eucalyptus oil, and it is mainly used as a mucolytic agent in inflammatory airway diseases. ANIMAL STUDIES: A study was performed to assess the ocular irritancy potential of eucalyptol to the isolated bovine cornea. The corneas treated with eucalyptol were clear post treatment and had cloudy areas post incubation. Eucalyptol was considered not to be an ocular corrosive or severe irritant. Cineole was administered by gavage to three groups, each of five male and five female rats, for twenty-eight consecutive days, at dose levels of 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day. For both sexes at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day, examination of the liver revealed a dosage dependent incidence of centrilobular hypertrophy of the hepatocytes; no other indicators of liver damage were apparent. Following the two week recovery period, hypertrophy of hepatocytes was no longer present at 600 mg/kg bw/day for either sex. 1,8-Cineole induced accumulation of protein droplets in proximal tubular epithelial cells in male rats. The renal changes were specific to the male rat and of no toxicological relevance to man. Eucalyptol was tested as a constituent of toothpaste in an oral long-term study with mice. Groups of 52 male mice were given 0, 8 and 32 mg/kg bw/day eucalyptol in toothpaste base by gavage for 80 weeks followed by an observation period between 16 and 24 weeks. No treatment-related effects on body weight, food consumption, survival, weight of adrenals, kidneys, liver, lungs or spleen, or on the microscopic appearance of brain, lungs, liver and kidneys or on tumor incidence was observed.",

This study examined postnatal intake of a chemosensory cue (cineole) that had been paired with alcohol's unconditioned effects. It also tested the interaction between prenatal association and postnatal conditioning with cineole and alcohol. Pregnant female rats intubated with cineole were given ethanol (EtOH).25 or 4.0 hr later. Other groups received only water or water paired with ethanol. During postnatal day 15 (PD15), infant consumption of cineole solution was assessed. After the cineole drinking test, pups were intubated with EtOH or water to assess infant conditioning. On PD16, all pups were tested for mouthing to milk alone or to a milk-cineole solution. Statistical analysis confirmed fetal associative conditioning attributable to the unconditioned effects of prenatal alcohol. Fetuses given explicit pairings of cineole and alcohol ingested less cineole on PD15 than control fetuses given a 4-hr interval between cineole and alcohol. On PD16, consumption of cineole was significantly increased by prenatal exposure to cineole. Teratogenic effects of this dose of prenatal alcohol did not affect postnatal associative or nonassociative behavior. Prenatal associative learning can be established through temporal contiguity between fetal chemosensory stimulation and alcohol's unconditioned properties. This associative memory survives to infancy and modulates intake patterns and behavioral reactivity to substances that were prenatally paired with alcohol intoxication.",

A control group of ten males and ten females was dosed with vehicle alone (Arachis oil BP).  Clinical signs, bodyweight change, dietary intake and water consumption were monitored during the study.  Pairing of animals within each dose group was undertaken on a one male: one female basis within each treatment group on Day 5 of the study, with females subsequently being allowed to litter and rear their offspring to Day 5 of lactation. An additional pairing for high dose females that failed to achieve pregnancy was performed to fully assess mating performance and fertility.  During the lactation phase, daily clinical observations were performed on all surviving offspring, together with litter size and offspring weights and assessment of surface righting reflex.  Adult males were terminated on Day 52 of the study following the completion of the second pairing at 600 mg/kg bw/day. Females and offspring were terminated on day 5 post partum. Any female which did not produce a pregnancy (unless allocated to a further mating phase) was terminated on or after Day 25 post coitum. All animals were subjected to a gross necropsy examination and histopathological evaluation of reproductive tissues was performed. Additional male organ weight and detailed histopathological examination of the testes were performed to more fully assess male fertility. Adult response:  Mortality: There were no unscheduled deaths in the study.    Clinical observations: Transient post-dosing salivation was observed from Day 7 at 600 mg/kg bw/day and Day 13 at 300 mg/kg bw/day. This sign was observed regularly throughout the treatment period with all animals being affected at both dosages, although the incidence of this finding was greatest at the high dosage. Transient post dosing salivation was also observed at 30 mg/kg bw/day for two females on Day 2 and one male on Day 50 of this study.    Bodyweight: At 600 mg/kg bw/day body weight gain of males was statistically significantly lower than control during the first week of treatment. Subsequent body weight gains were considered to reflect normal biological varaition, but overall gain at termination remained lower than control.  Bodyweight gain of males at 30 and 300 mg/kg bw/day and for females at all dosages, throughout the pre-pairing, gestation and lactation phases of the study, were considered to have been unaffected by treatment.    Food consumption: Food consumption for both sexes was considered to have been unaffected by treatment throughout the study, and including gestation and lactation phases for females, at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day.    Food efficiency: At 600 mg/kg bw/day food conversation efficiency for males was lower than control during week 1; subsequent food utilisation was similar to control.  Food conversation efficiency of males at 30 and 300 mg/kg bw/day and for females at all dosages, throughout the pre-pairing, gestation and lactation phases of the study, were considered to have been unaffected by the treatment.    Reproductive performance:  Mating: Pre-coital interval and mating evidence at the times of conception did not indicate any adverse effect of treatment on mating performance at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day.    Fertility: At 600 mg/kg bw/day, only seven females delivered a litter following the initial pairing but subsequent re-mating and additional assessment of male organ weight and detailed testicular histopathology did not indicate any treatment related effect on fertility for either sex. There was also no effect of treatment on fertility at 30 and 300 mg/kg bw/day.    Gestation lengths: Gestation length was considered to be unaffected by treatment at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day.    Litter responses:  Offspring litter size, sex ratio and viability: There was no effect of maternal treatment on corpora lutea and implantations counts, pre- and post-implantation loss, number of offspring born, sex ratio or subsequent survival to Day 4 of age at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day.    Offspring growth and development: At 600 mg/kg bw/day initial offspring body weight was similar to control but weight gain to Day 4 was statistically significantly lower than control.  Mean offspring body weights, litter weight and weight gains to Day 4 of age were unaffected by maternal treatment at 30 and 300 mg/kg bw/day.    Offspring observations: Assessment of surface righting ability on Day 1; offspring clinical signs and necropsy findings and did not indicate any effect of maternal treatment.    Pathology:  Necropsy: Macroscpoic necropsy findings did not indicate any effect of treatment at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day.    Organ weights: Male reproductive organ weights were unaffected by treatment at 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day and did not indicate any effect on fertility.    Histopathology: Histopathological examinations did not indicate any effect of treatment at 600 mg/kg bw/day and these examinations, including detailed assessment of the spermatogenetic cycle for the testes did not indicate any effect on male fertility. Within the context of this study, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for adult toxicity, reproduction and offspring survival, growth and development was considered to be 600 mg/kg bw/day.",

The principle of the assay was based on the measurement of cytotoxicity in reconstructed human epidermal cultures following topical exposure to eucalyptol by means of the colorimetric MTT reduction assay. Cell viability is measured by enzymatic reduction of the yellow MTT tetrazolium salt (3 -[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) to a blue formazan salt (within the mitochondria of viable cells) in the eucalyptol treated tissues relative to the negative controls. The concentration of the inflammatory mediator IL-1a in the culture medium retained following the 42-hour post-exposure incubation period is also determined for eucalyptol which are found to be borderline non-irritant based upon the MTT reduction endpoint. This complimentary end-point will be used to either confirm a non-irritant result or will be used to override the non-irritant result. This method was designed to be compatible with the following: OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals No. 439 In VitroSkin Irritation (adopted 22 July 2010) Method B.46 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 440/2008/EC Triplicate tissues were treated with eucalyptol for an exposure period of 15 minutes. At the end of the exposure period each tissue was rinsed before incubating for 42 hours. At the end of the post-exposure incubation period each tissue was taken for MTT-loading. The maintenance medium from beneath each tissue was transferred to pre-labelled micro tubes and stored in a freezer for possible inflammatory mediator determination. After MTT loading a total biopsy of each epidermis was made and placed into micro tubes containing acidified isopropanol for extraction of formazan crystals out of the MTT-loaded tissues.  At the end of the formazan extraction period each tube was mixed thoroughly and duplicate 200 ul samples were transferred to the appropriate wells of a pre-labelled 96 -well plate. The optical density was measured at 540 nm.  Data are presented in the form of percentage viability (MTT reduction in the test item treated tissues relative to negative control tissues). The relative mean viability of the test item treated tissues was 88.9% after the 15-Minute exposure period. The quality criteria required for acceptance of results in the test were satisfied. Eucalyptol was considered to be Non-Irritant (NI).",

The method was designed to be compatible with the following: OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals No. 437 (2009) \"Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Assay\" The undiluted eucalyptol was applied for 10 minutes followed by an incubation period of 120 minutes. Negative and positive control items were tested concurrently. The two endpoints, decreased light transmission through the cornea (opacity) and increased passage of sodium fluorescein dye through the cornea (permeability) were combined in an empirically derived formula to generate an In Vitro Irritancy Score (IVIS). Eucalyptol induced an in vitro irritancy score of 17.3 The corneas treated with eucalyptol were clear post treatment and had cloudy areas post incubation. Eucalyptol was considered not to be an ocular corrosive or severe irritant.",

We have investigated the action of aromatic vapors on the cough reflex in conscious guinea-pigs. Animals (n = 13) were pretreated with air or test vapors for 5 min at a rate of 1 L/min. One minute later the animal was challenged with aerosolized citric acid for 2 min. Control responses to air pretreatment were not significantly different throughout the procedures. Three concentrations of each aromatic vapor were used (3, 10 and 30 micrograms/L menthol, 50, 133 and 500 ug/L camphor and 0.8, 2.7 and 8 mg/L cineole). Menthol proved the most effective antitussive--10 and 30 ug/L produced a significant 28 and 56% reduction in cough frequency--500 ug/L camphor gave a significant 33% reduction, while cineole, at the concentrations used, had no significant effect. An increase in cough latency coincided with a reduction in cough frequency. These results demonstrate the efficacy of aromatic vapors as antitussives in chemically induced cough.",

Of the terpenes tested, menthol and cineole inhibited by 70 per cent, while borneol and methone were slightly less inhibitory (50 per cent) when dosed at the same rate. Limonene, a rapidly metabolized terpene, also showed significant inhibition, while pinene and camphene were without effect. This inhibition of reductase correlated well with inhibition of C2-flux into non-saponifiable lipid (r = 0.86, P < 0.001). There were no changes in a variety of other microsomal membrane activities, indicating that the effect was specific rather than due to generalized hepatoxicity. Possible mechanisms for the inhibition of reductase are discussed.",

Cineole was administered by gavage to three groups, each of five male and five female Wistar Han:RccHan:WIST strain rats, for twenty-eight consecutive days, at dose levels of 30, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day. A control group of five males and five females was dosed with vehicle alone (Arachis oil BP) over the same treatment period. Two recovery groups, each of five males and five females, were treated with the high dose (600 mg cineole /kg bw/day) or the vehicle alone for twenty-eight consecutive days and then maintained without treatment for a further fourteen days. Clinical signs, body weight change, food and water consumption were monitored during the study. Hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis were evaluated for all non-recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period and for all recovery group animals at the end of the treatment-free period.  There were no unscheduled deaths on the study. Clinical signs were restricted to post-dosing salivation with two males and all five females at 300 mg/kg bw/day and all males and females at 1000 mg/kg bw/day being affected. There were no obvious adverse effects of treatment at 30, 300 or 600 mg/kg bw/day. No findings considered to represent an adverse effect of treatment were observed. There were no obvious adverse effects of treatment at 30, 300 or 600 mg/kg bw/day. At 600 mg/kg bw/day slightly lower mean body weight gain of males than control was observed for Week 1, differences attaining statistical significance. No adverse effect of treatment was observed for females at this dosage or either sex at 30 and 300 mg/kg bw/day. There were no obvious adverse effects of treatment at 30, 300 or 600 mg/kg bw/day. For females at 600 mg/kg bw/day water consumption was notably lower than control on the first day of treatment. Water intake for males at this dosage and for either sex at 30 or 300 mg/kg bw/day appeared unaffected by treatment. For males at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day mean platelet count at the end of the treatment period was higher than control with differences attaining statistical significance. There were no differences in blood chemistry parameters that were considered to represent an adverse effect of treatment. There were no obvious adverse effects of treatment at 30, 300 or 600 mg/kg bw/day. There were no obvious adverse effects of treatment at 30, 300 or 600 mg/kg bw/day. At 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day, male absolute and body weight-relative kidney weights were statistically significantly increased at the end of the treatment period compared to control.  An statistically significant increase in absolute and body weight-relative liver weights, considered to be associated with adaptive liver changes, was observed at the end of treatment period for females at 30 mg/kg bw/day and both sexes at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day, in comparison to control. Higher liver weights were still apparent at the end of the recovery period and attained statistical significance in comparison to control. For males at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day at the end of treatment, examination of the kidneys revealed an increased severity of hyaline droplets in the proximal tubules, accompanied at the high dosage with sporadic tubular cell degeneration. An increased mean severity of multifocal tubular basophilia and/or interstitial mononuclear cell foci were observed in association with renal tubules where hyaline droplets were excessively deposited was also observed at these dosages. For males at 600 mg/kg bw/day, following the treatment-free recovery period, these treatment-related findings decreased in severity. For both sexes at 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/day, examination of the liver revealed a dosage dependent incidence of centrilobular hypertrophy of the hepatocytes; no other indicators of liver damage was apparent. Following the two week recovery period, hypertrophy of hepatocytes was no longer present at 600 mg/kg bw/day for either sex. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for the female rat was considered to be 600 mg/kg bw/day but for the male rat was only 30 mg/kg bw/day.   However, the adverse findings observed for males were characterized by renal changes specific to the male rat and of no toxicological relevance to man.   Excluding these renal changes, the NOAEL was 600 mg/kg bw/day and this represents the most appropriate dosage for any assessment of the risk to human health.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,8-cineole will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,8-cineole will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.4 days. 1,8-Cineole does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,8-cineole is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 220. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. 1,8-Cineole may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, 1,8-cineole is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hrs and 8 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 30 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,8-cineole may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,8-cineole is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,8-cineole via inhalation of ambient air and food odors, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 1,8-cineole.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 1.9 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 3.5X10+3 mg/L(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hours and 8 days, respectively(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that cineole is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 13 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 8 days(SRC). 1,8-Cineole's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 1,8-cineole from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon the vapor pressure(1).",

Evaluation of ambient air around Eucalyptus globulus trees growing in Algiers City area, Algeria revealed 1,8-cineole present at 15.2% of total biogenic volatile emissions. It was not detected in emissions from Pinus halepensis or Cedrus atlantica trees(5). Emission rates of 1,8-cineole from forests in five geographical regions in Switzerland were monitored. Biogenic volatile organic compounds comprise 23% of total annual emissions in Switzerland. The Norway spruce (Picea abies) is the dominant tree at 49.1%; 1,8-cineole is a component of Norway spruce emissions(6). 1,8-Cineole was present at 8.54% of total emissions measured in 3 hours from a Mediterranean oak species Quercus ilex(7).",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Neither of the metabolic dihydrodiols of benzo(j)fluoranthene were formed with a high degree of steroselectivity.

At least four phenols were detected among the metabolites of benzo(j)fluoranthene These were identified as 3-,4-,6- and 10-hydroxybenzo(j)fluoranthene based upon comparison of their UV spectra and HPLC retention times with those of synthetic reference standards.

In addition, 4- and 0-hydroxybenzol(j) fluoranthene and benzo(j)fluoranthene-4,5-dione have been tentatively identified among the metabolites formed in vivo in mouse skin. The enantiomeric purity of the metabolic dihydrodiols of benzo(j)fluoranthene as formed in vivo in mouse skin was determined. The major enantiomeric of benzo(j)fluoranthene-4,5-diol was present in 57-62% enantiomeric excess while that of benzo(j)fluoranthene-9,10-diol was present in 66-71% enantiomeric excess. In each case the later-eluting enantiomer on chiral stationary-phase high performance liquid chromatography predominated. The tumor-initiating activity of trans-2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzol(j) fluoranthene (BjF-2,3-diol), trans-4,5-Dihydro-4,5-dihydroxybenzol(j) fluoranthene, trans-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxybenzol(j)fluoranthene, and benzo(j)fluoranthene was evaluated on the skin of female CD-1 mice. As a total initiation dose of 3 umol/mouse trans-4,5-Dihydro-4,5-dihydroxybenzo(j)fluoranthene resulted in a 100% incidence of tumor-bearing mice with 5.0 tumors/mouse. In comparison, benzo(j)fluoranthene-9,10-diol elicited a 60% incidence of tumor-bearing mice with 1.7 tumors/mouse, while benzo(j)fluoranthene-2,3-diol was inactive. At the same dose, benzo(j)fluoranthene gave rise to a 90% incidence of tumor-bearing mice with 7.8 tumors/mouse. At a 1 mumol dose, trans-4,5-Dihydro-4,5-dihydroxybenzo(j) fluoranthene induced a 78% incidence of tumor-bearing mice with 4.5 tumors/mouse while benzo(j)fluoranthene gave rise to a 70% tumor incidence with 3.4 tumors/mouse. These studies indicate that while trans-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxybenzo(j) fluoranthene could contribute to the overall tumorigenic activity of benzo(j)fluoranthene in mouse skin, trans-4,5-Dihydro-4,5-dihydroxybenzol(j)fluoranthene is a more potent tumor initiator in the target tissue.",

Ventilation should be employed to prevent exposure. However, in activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a respirator and protective suit (preferably one piece, disposable, closely fitting at the ankles and wrists), including gloves, hair covering, and overshoes. Smoking, eating, and drinking should be prohibited in benzo(j)fluoranthene work areas.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Benzo(j)fluoranthene was reported to induce mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 (his-/his+) at a concentration of 10 ug/plate in the presence of an exogenous metabolic system. Benzo(j)fluoranthene-4,5-diol is the major proximate tumorigenic metabolite of benzo(j)fluoranthene on mouse skin.",

The compounds tested were trans-4,5-dihydroxy-anti-6,6a.epoxy-4,5,6,6a-tetrahydroBjF (BjF-4,5-DE) and trans-9,10-dihydroxy-anti-11,12-epoxy-9,10,11,12-tetrahydroBjF (BjF-9,10-DE). The positive control was trans-3,4-dihydroxy-anti-1,2-epoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[c]phenanthren e (BcPDE). Groups of 20 female CD rats were maintained on AIN-76A-based high fat diet (23.5% corn oil) and at age 30 days were given three injections of 0.2 umol of each compound in 0.1 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or DMSO alone, in the tissue underlying each of the three left thoracic nipples. The three right nipple areas were injected with DMSO alone. On the next day, each rat received three injections of 0.2 umol of each compound in 0.1 mL DMSO, or DMSO alone, under each of the three left inguinal nipples, and DMSO alone under the three right nipples. The experiment was terminated after 44 weeks. BjF-9,10-DE, mean latent period 21.0 +/- 8.8 weeks, was more active than BjF-4,5-DE, mean latent period 36.2 +/- 8.0 weeks. BjF-9,10-DE induced tumors in 70% of the rats; a total of 38 fibroadenomas and eight adenocarcinomas was observed. BjF-4,5-DE induced tumors in 55% of the rats. These included 17 fibroadenomas, seven dysplastic fibroadenomas, and two adenocarcinomas. BcPDE induced tumors rapidly, with a mean latent period of 9.7 +/- 4.0 weeks. All BcPDE-treated rats had mammary tumors. A total of 46 adenocarcinomas, as well as other tumors, were observed. In the DMSO-treated rats, mammary tumor incidence was 15%. The results of this study demonstrate that BjF-9,10-DE is more carcinogenic in the rat mammary gland than BjF-4,5-DE and that low doses of both diol epoxide metabolites of BjF are effective mammary tumorigens in female CD rats maintained on a high fat diet. /trans-4,5-dihydroxy-anti-6,6a.epoxy-4,5,6,6a-tetrahydrobenzo[j]fluoranthene; trans-9,10-dihydroxy-anti-11,12-epoxy-9,10,11,12-tetrahydrobenzo[j]fluoranthene/",

Information on mortality was presented in the form of curves. After 1 yr, mortality was about 8% in controls, 5-20% in benzo(j)fluoranthene treated groups & 12-20% in positive controls; after 2 years, mortality was about 70% in controls, 75-90% in the benzo(j)fluoranthene treated groups & 80-100% in the positive controls (all animals of the high dose benzo(a)pyrene treated group had died before week 85). A total of 4 mice treated with benzo(j)fluoranthene developed local tumors; 1/38 low dose animals had a sarcoma at the site of application (2.6%), 1/35 mid dose animals had a local tumor (2.9%) (site & type unspecified), & 1/38 high dose animals had a papilloma & 1/38 a carcinoma of the dorsal skin (5.3%). No local tumors were found in acetone treated controls. The incidence of local tumors in the various positive control groups ranged from 8/34 to 24/35. There was a high rate of \"spontaneous\" systemic tumors (about 70%). After age standardization of incidences, the differences between the groups were not statistically significant.",

Three similar groups of 35 rats received 0.1, 0.3 or 1.0 mg benzo(a)pyrene (positive controls), & further groups of 35 rats served as untreated or vehicle controls. The rats were observed until spontaneous death: mean survival times were 110, 117, 89, 111, 77, 54, 118 & 104 weeks for the low, mid & high dose benzo(j)fluoranthene treated, the low, mid & high dose positive control, the untreated & the vehicle control groups, respectively. Pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas were found in each of the benzo(j)fluoranthene treated groups, with incidences of 1/35, 3/35 & 18/35 in the low, mid & high dose groups, respectively. The incidences of pulmonary carcinomas in the positive control groups were 4/35, 21/35 & 33/35 in the low, mid & high dose groups, respectively. In addition, 6 low dose rats & 2 mid dose rats of the positive control groups developed a pulmonary fibrosarcoma. No lung tumors were observed in the vehicle-control or untreated groups.",

It has been identified in mainstream smoke of cigarettes and marijuana cigarettes, exhaust from gasoline engines, in emissions from burning of various types of coal, emissions from oil-fired heating, used motor oils, and smoked and broiled fish. Benzo(j)fluoranthene is released in stack emissions from waste incineration. It occurs in fossil fuels. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.7X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzo(j)fluoranthene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzo(j)fluoranthene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.2 hours. Particulate-phase benzo(j)fluoranthene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benzo(j)fluoranthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzo(j)fluoranthene is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 600,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Benzo(j)fluoranthene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with four or more rings, such as benzo(j)fluoranthene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation. If released into water, benzo(j)fluoranthene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 4990 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. However, benzo(j)fluoranthene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to benzo(j)fluoranthene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzo(j)fluoranthene is produced as a product of incomplete combustion of organic fuels. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzo(j)fluoranthene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and dermal contact with particulate matter resulting from combustion.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 4990(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 6.11(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, benzo(j)fluoranthene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(5). PAHs with four or more rings, such as benzo(j)fluoranthene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation(6). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Benzo(j)fluoranthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(7), and therefore is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis at water surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

Vapor-phase benzo(j)fluoranthene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.2 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.4X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase benzo(j)fluoranthene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Benzo(j)fluoranthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

However, benzo(j)fluoranthene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(3). Using a database of measured fish biotransformation half-lives of PAHs(4), a fish biotransformation half-life of 3.4 days has been estimated for benzo(j)fluoranthene(1). \"Apparent\" bioconcentration factors (ratio between tissue and sediment concentrations) of 8.2 and 0.6 were measured in Polychaete sp. and Capitella capitata, respectively(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

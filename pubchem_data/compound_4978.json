When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

Both compounds are highly effective in preventing viral-induced manifestations that follow infections with a variety of retroviruses in vivo and in vitro. Pseudohypericin and hypericin probably interfere with viral infection and/or spread by direct inactivation of the virus or by preventing virus shedding, budding, or assembly at the cell membrane. These compounds have no apparent activity against the transcription, translation, or transport of viral proteins to the cell membrane and also no direct effect on the polymerase. This property distinguishes their mode of action from that of the major antiretro-virus group of nucleoside analogues. Hypericin and pseudohypericin have low in vitro cytotoxic activity at concentrations sufficient to produce dramatic antiviral effects in murine tissue culture model systems that use radiation leukemia and Friend viruses. Administration of these compounds to mice at the low doses sufficient to prevent retroviral-induced disease appears devoid of undesirable side effects. This lack of toxicity at therapeutic doses extends to humans, as these compounds have been tested in patients as antidepressants with apparent salutary effects. /These/ observations to date suggest that pseudohypericin and hypericin could become therapeutic tools against retroviral-induced diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).",

They contain various substances with the naphthodianthrones hypericin and pseudohypericin as characteristic ingredients. These compounds were shown to cause phototoxicity in cell culture and in animals. A placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial with monitoring of hypericin and pseudohypericin plasma concentration was performed to evaluate the increase in dermal photosensitivity in humans after application of high dose hypericum extracts. The study was divided into a single dose and a multiple dose part. In the single dose period, each of 13 volunteers received in a double blind fourfold complete crossover design, either placebo, or 900, 1800 or 3600 mg of a standardized hypericum extract (LI 160) containing zero, 2.81, 5.62 and 11.25 mg of total hypericin (total hypericin is the sum of hypericin and pseudohypericin).

In a placebo-controlled, double blind study, 33 healthy volunteers were randomized into three treatment groups that received SJW extract (LI160) with different comedications (placebo, cimetidine, and carbamazepine) for 7 days after a run-in period of 11 days with SJW alone. Hypericin and pseudohypericin pharmacokinetics were measured on days 10 and 17. Between-group comparisons showed no statistically significant differences in AUC(0-24), C(max), and t(max) values for hypericin and pseudohypericin. Within-group comparisons, however, revealed a statistically significant increase in hypericin AUC(0-24) from a median of 119 (range 82-163 ug hr/L) to 149 ug hr/L (61-202 ug hr/L) with cimetidine comedication and a decrease in pseudohypericin AUC(0-24) from a median of 51.0 (16.4-102.9 ug hr/L) to 36.4 ug hr/L (14.0-102.0 ug hr/L) with carbamazepine comedication compared to the baseline pharmacokinetics in each group. Hypericin and pseudohypericin pharmacokinetics were only marginally influenced by comedication with the enzyme inhibitors and inducers cimetidine and carbamazepine.",

Oral administration of 250, 750, and 1500 ug of hypericin and 526, 1578, and 3156 ug of pseudohypericin resulted in median peak plasma levels (Cmax) of 1.3, 7.2, and 16.6 ug/L for hypericin and 3.4, 12.1, and 29.7 ug/L for pseudohypericin, respectively. Cmax and AUC values for the lowest dose were disproportionally lower than those for the higher doses. A lag time of 1.9 hr for hypericin was remarkably longer than the 0.4 hr lag time for pseudohypericin. Median half-lives for absorption, distribution, and elimination were 0.6, 6, and 43.1 hr after 750 ug of hypericin and 1.3, 1.4, and 24.8 hr after 1578 ug of pseudohypericin, respectively; the corresponding Cmax levels were 8.8 and 8.5 ug/L. Both hypericin and pseudohypericin were initially distributed into a central volume of 4.2 and 5 L, respectively. The systemic availability of hypericin and pseudohypericinfrom the extract was 14 and 21%, respectively.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Pseudohypericin turned out to be a quite strong inhibitor of TrxR1 (IC(50)=4.40uM) being far more effective than hypericin (IC(50)=157.08uM). In turn, the IC(50) values measured toward TrxR2 were 7.45uM for pseudohypericin and 43.12uM for hypericin. When compared to pseudohypericin, the inhibition caused by hypericin usually required significantly longer times, in particular on TrxR1. These important differences in the inhibitory potencies and profiles were analysed through a molecular modeling approach. Notably, both compounds were found to accommodate in the NADPH-binding pocket of the enzyme. The binding of the two naphthodianthrones to thioredoxin reductase seems to be particularly strong as the inhibitory effects were fully retained after gel filtration. Also, we found that TrxR inhibition by hypericin and pseudohypericin does not involve the active site selenol/thiol motif as confirmed by biochemical and modeling studies. The resulting inhibition pattern is very similar to that produced by the two naphthodianthrones on glutathione reductase. As the thioredoxin system is highly overexpressed in cancer cells, its inhibition by hypericin and pseudohypericin, natural compounds showing appreciable anticancer properties, might offer new clues on their mechanism of action and open interesting perspectives for future tumor therapies.",

This study aimed to investigate the stability of SJW components in aqueous solutions and fruit-flavored drinks. Changes of active marker components (hypericin, pseudohypericin, hyperforin, and adhyperforin) as affected by pH and light exposure were determined by HPLC, and the degradation of hyperforin was analyzed by LC-MS/MS and NMR. SJW components were found to be unstable in acidic aqueous solutions. More changes occurred under light exposure, with hyperforin and adhyperforin decreasing the most. Less severe changes were observed in the drink sample as compared to the pH 2.65 solution. Major degradation products of hyperforin in acidic aqueous solutions were identified as furohyperforin, furohyperforin hydroperoxide, and furohyperforin isomer a. The latter was also found in the drink product containing SJW as an ingredient. Biological activities and potential quality and safety implications of these chemical changes are yet to be evaluated.",

A rapid extraction technique followed by a liquid chromatographic (LC) method was developed to determine 4 characteristic bioactive compounds (pseudohypericin, hypericin, hyperforin, and adhyperforin) from St. John's wort in dietary supplements and functional foods to which it was added. Solid samples, including dried leaf/flower mixture, dietary supplement capsules, tea bags, puff and snack bar, were extracted with methanol by sonication. Noncarbonated, fruit-flavored drinks were centrifuged and mixed with methanol. Compounds were then determined by isocratic, reversed-phase LC with UV detection at 2 wavelengths and further identified or confirmed by photodiode array spectra and LC/mass spectrometry. Within-laboratory method variations (% RSD) were satisfactory. Very low amounts, if any, of the 4 components were found in drink and puff samples, and none was found in the snack bar. The methods developed provide a useful means for the determination of St. John's wort components in dietary supplements and functional foods.",

Recently, several anti-inflammatory activities of Hp have been reported. An ethanol extract of Hp was fractionated with the guidance of an anti-inflammatory bioassay (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin E2 production (PGE2)), and four constituents were identified. When combined together at concentrations detected in the Hp fraction to make a 4 component system, these constituents (0.1 uM chlorogenic acid (compound 1), 0.08 uM amentoflavone (compound 2), 0.07 uM quercetin (compound 3), and 0.03 uM pseudohypericin (compound 4)) explained the majority of the activity of the fraction when activated by light, but only partially explained the activity of this Hp fraction in dark conditions. One of the constituents, light-activated pseudohypericin, was necessary, but not sufficient to explain the reduction in LPS-induced PGE2 of the 4 component system. The Hp fraction and the 4 component system inhibited lipoxygenase and cytosolic phospholipase A2, two enzymes in the PGE2-mediated inflammatory response. The 4 component system inhibited the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the Hp fraction inhibited the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Thus, the Hp fraction and selected constituents from this fraction showed evidence of blocking pro-inflammatory mediators but not enhancing inflammation-suppressing mediators.",

Previous reports on other SJW products had shown remarkably decreased plasma concentrations of certain co-medicated drugs, which was attributed to an inducing effect of SJW on cytochrome P-450 (CYP) and p-glycoprotein (p-gp) activity. Two randomised, placebo-controlled studies were performed with 28 healthy volunteers (age 18 - 55 years) in each study. In study A, single doses of alprazolam (1 mg; substrate of CYP3A4) and caffeine (100 mg; CYP1A2) were given on days 1 and 11. In study B, single doses of tolbutamide (500 mg, days 1 and 11; CYP2C9) and multiple doses of digoxin (0.75 mg on days -2 and -1, 0.25 mg /per day/ on days 1 to 11; p-gp) were given. The participants received SJW (Esbericum capsules; 240 mg /per day/ of extract, 3.5 mg hyperforin) or placebo on days 2 to 11. Blood for pharmacokinetic analysis was drawn on days 1 and 11. No statistically significant differences were found in the primary kinetic parameter, AUC0 - 24, of alprazolam, caffeine (AUC0 - 12), paraxanthine, tolbutamide, 4-hydroxytolbutamide, and digoxin between the placebo group and the SJW group at the end of the study. The SJW-induced change in AUCs was less than 12 % of the initial median AUC of the participants in studies A and B, thus clinically irrelevant. On day 11, trough concentrations were 2.0 (range 0.6 - 4.1) ug/L and 1.0 (0.2 - 3.9) ug/L for hypericin and pseudohypericin, respectively, whereas hyperforin concentrations were below the quantification limit (< 1 ug/L). Kinetics of investigated probe drugs were only marginally influenced by concomitant treatment with Esbericum capsules. This may be due in particular to the low hyperforin plasma concentration as this SJW component has been shown to activate the PXR receptor which regulates expression of CYP3A4 and p-gp...",

Before the recent reports of apparent hepatotoxicity associated with its use, kava (Piper methysticum Forst. F.), was one of the top 10 selling herbal remedies in Europe and North America. This adverse effect was not previously encountered with the traditional beverage which was prepared as a water infusion in contrast to the commercial products which are extracted with organic solvents. Kavalactones, the active principles in kava, are potent inhibitors of several of the CYP 450 enzymes, suggesting a high potential for causing pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs and other herbs which are metabolized by the same CYP 450 enzymes. Furthermore, some kavalactones have been shown to possess pharmacological effects, such as blockade of GABA receptors and sodium and calcium ion channels, which may lead to pharmacodynamic interactions with other substances which possess similar pharmacological proprieties. St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), used extensively for the treatment of mild to moderate clinical depression, has long been considered safer than the conventional pharmaceutical agents. However, its ability, through its active constituents hypericin, pseudohypericin and hyperforin, to induce intestinal P-glycoprotein/MRD1 and both intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 enzyme, could markedly reduce the distribution and disposition of their co-substrates. In addition, St. John's wort is a potent uptake inhibitor of the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine all of which have a role in mood control. Consequently, the very real potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between the herb and pharmaceutical drugs which share this mechanism of action and, like St. John's wort, are used for mood elevation. However, presently there is very little evidence to substantiate actual pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interaction between drugs and kava or St. John's wort. This review provides a brief overview of the existing data on interactions of kava and St. John's wort with pharmaceutical agents and as a result reveals the urgent need for detailed investigations to identify clinically significant interactions for these herbal remedies that have the potential to cause adverse effects.",

They contain various substances with the naphthodianthrones hypericin and pseudohypericin as characteristic ingredients. These compounds were shown to cause phototoxicity in cell culture and in animals. A placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial with monitoring of hypericin and pseudohypericin plasma concentration was performed to evaluate the increase in dermal photosensitivity in humans after application of high dose hypericum extracts. The study was divided into a single dose and a multiple dose part. In the single dose period, each of 13 volunteers received in a double blind fourfold complete crossover design, either placebo, or 900, 1800 or 3600 mg of a standardized hypericum extract (LI 160) containing zero, 2.81, 5.62 and 11.25 mg of total hypericin (total hypericin is the sum of hypericin and pseudohypericin). Maximum total hypericin plasma concentrations were observed about 4 hr after dosage and were 0, 0.028, 0.061 and 0.159 mg/L, respectively. Before and 4 hr after drug intake, the subjects were exposed at small areas of their back to increasing doses of solar simulated irradiation (SSI, with combined ultraviolet A, UV-A, and UV-B light) and another part was exposed to selective UV-A light irradiation. Minimal erythema dose was determined 5, 20 and 68 hr after irradiation. Comparison of SSI sensitivity without and with hypericum extract did not show and difference and there was no dose-related trend in light sensitivity. Sensitivity to selective UV-A light was increased only after the highest dose from a minimal tanning dose of 10.8 J/ sq cm (mean) after placebo to 8.7 J/sq cm after 3600 mg extract with marginal statistical significance (p = 0.03 by one sided paired t-test). There was no correlation between total hypericin plasma concentrations and photosensitivity. In the multiple dose part, 50 volunteers received 600 mg hypericum extract t.i.d. with a daily dose of 5.6 mg of total hypericin. Comparison of UV light sensitivity before dosing with day 15 of treatment showed a slightly increased SSI sensitivity expressed by decrease of the MED from 0.17 to 0.16 J/sq cm (p = 0.005 by Wilcoxon test), and similarly, sensitivity to UV-A light increased (the mean tanning dose decreased from 9.9 to 7.8 J/sq cm, p < 0.0001). This increase in cutaneous light sensitivity could be compensated by reducing irradiation time by 21%. Doses used in this study were higher than typical doses in current commercial preparations. In spite of these high doses in the double blind single dose part, frequency of side effects was equal to placebo medication and UV light sensitivity was not or only marginally increased. The study does not, however, exclude phototoxic reactions with doses above 11.25 mg of total hypericin and plasma levels above 100 micrograms/L. Furthermore, phototoxicity may be different after application of pure hypericin, since some constituents in the plant extract may exhibit protective effects.",

Therefore, the objective of the present studies was to investigate the effect of two different hypericum extracts (STW 3, STW 3-VI) on photosensitivity with respect to minimal erythema dose (MED) after 14 days treatment. Both open, multiple-dose, one-phase studies were conducted in 20 healthy men, receiving one tablet per day. MED values were determined prior to hypericum extract administration (baseline) and after 14 days treatment using an erythem tester emitting a light very similar to sun light (main emission spectrum: 285-350 nm). Skin reactions with respect to MED were evaluated 12 hr, 24 hr (primary endpoint), 48 hr and 7 days after irradiation. All volunteers reached steady-state of hypericin/pseudohypericin plasma concentrations before study day 14, when the irradiation under treatment conditions took place. In all subjects MED was measurable under baseline and under hypericum treatment conditions. With respect to the primary endpoint, in both studies, mean MED (24 hr) were not significantly different between baseline and after 14 days hypericum treatment. However, individually photosensitivity of the skin could increase under treatment conditions, just as well photosensitivity could decrease or remain unchanged. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory parameters, the vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety during the examinations. In one study (STW 3), two adverse events were reported, both described as hypersensitivity to light in mild Intensity. The two studies showed that treatment with the two hypericum extracts under steady state and under prescribed conditions were safe medications without significant increases of photosensitivity.",

Since hypericin has been proposed as a photosensitizer for photodynamic cancer therapy, the photocytotoxicity of its congener pseudohypericin has been investigated. The presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) or albumin extensively inhibits the photocytotoxic effect of pseudohypericin against A431 tumor cells, and is associated with a large decrease in cellular uptake of the compound. These results suggest that pseudohypericin, in contrast to hypericin, interacts strongly with constituents of FCS, lowering its interaction with cells. Since pseudohypericin is two to three times more abundant in Hypericum than hypericin and the bioavailabilities of pseudohypericin and hypericin after oral administration are similar, these results suggest that hypericin, and not pseudohypericin, is likely to be the constituent responsible for hypericism. Moreover, the dramatic decrease of photosensitizing activity of pseudohypericin in the presence of serum may restrict its applicability in clinical situations.",

H displays cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects in neoplastic cell lines. Here, /the authors/ have assessed the phototoxic and apoptosis-inducing capacity of PH compared to H in a cell culture model with human leukemic lymphoma cells (Jurkat). Treatment with both photoactivated H and PH resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation, whereas not photoactivated H and PH had no effect at the concentrations tested. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of H was lower (100 ng/mL) as compared to PH (200 ng/mL) (p < 0.05). In an apoptosis assay we found a dose-dependent increase of DNA fragmentation after treatment with both photoactivated H and PH. The cytotoxic potential of PH should be taken into account during systemic therapy with Hypericum extracts, since PH is about two times more abundant than H in Hypericum perforatum.",

The aerial parts of Hypericum rumeliacum Boiss. subsp. apollinis (Boiss. & Heldr.) Robson & Strid (Guttiferae), a perennial herb growing wild in Greece, were subjected to biological and phytochemical studies. The H. rumeliacum methanol extract showed, on the DPPH test, antioxidant activity (IC(50) = 23.61 ug/mL). The antiinflammatory activity of the extract (70 mg/kg, i.p.), in the carrageenan-induced paw edema in rat, was studied. In this experimental model an inhibition of paw edema, significant from the first to third hour, was observed. The histological examination confirmed resolution of the inflammatory process observed in vivo. Through HPLC analysis of the H. rumeliacum methanol extract, the naphthodianthrones hypericin, pseudohypericin and some polyphenol compounds, such as chlorogenic acid, rutin and isoquercitrin, were identified and quantified. The antioxidant activity of H. rumeliacum could be chiefly related to polyphenol compounds that are well known as the main contributors to the free radical-scavenging effects. The antiinflammatory effect of the methanol extract of the aerial parts could be due to the synergic action both of hypericin and polyphenol compounds.",

(St. John's wort; SJW) is one of the leading psychotherapeutic phytomedicines and great effort has been devoted to clarifying its mechanism of action. /The researchers/ have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of several pure compounds isolated from the crude extract to gain further insight into the molecular actions of various substituents of SJW. /This study/ characterized the in vitro pharmacology of the naphthodianthrones hypericin and pseudohypericin, the phloroglucinol derivative hyperforin, and several flavonoids at 42 biogenic amine receptors and transporters using the resources of the National Institute of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program. The biflavonoid amentoflavone significantly inhibited binding at serotonin (5-HT(1D), 5-HT(2C)), D(3)-dopamine, delta-opiate, and benzodiazepine receptors. The naphthodianthrone hypericin had significant activity at D(3)- and D(4)-dopamine receptors and beta-adrenergic receptors. With the exception of the D(1)-dopamine receptor, the phloroglucinol derivative hyperforin was less active than other SJW constituents tested on all screened receptors. ...present in vitro data clearly show that several pure substances in SJW are potential CNS psychoactive agents and may contribute to the antidepressant efficacy of the plant in a complex manner. /These/ data also reveal novel and heretofore unexpected interactions of pure compounds in SJW at a number of GPCRs, transporters, and ion channels. /The authors/ hypothesize that additive or synergistic actions of different single compounds may be responsible for the antidepressant efficacy of SJW...",

St. John's wort extracts potently inhibited CYP1A1-catalyzed (+/-)-trans-7,8-dihydro-7,8-dihydroxy-benzo(a)pyrene (7,8-diol-B[a]P) epoxidation, the terminal reaction leading to the ultimate carcinogenic product (+/-)-B[a]P-r-7,t-8-dihydrodiol-t-9,10-epoxide (diolepoxide 2). All constituents, except rutin, were shown to possess strong inhibitory potencies toward diolepoxide 2 formation from 7,8-diol-B[a]P, with IC(50) values of 0.5 uM (hypericin), 1.2 uM (hyperforin), 1.5 uM (quercetin), and 8 uM (pseudohypericin), respectively. Preincubation experiments revealed that their action was not mechanism based. Inhibition kinetics studies showed the anthrodianthrone compound hypericin to be a noncompetitive inhibitor, with a K(i) value of 0.6 uM, and the phloroglucinol hyperforin to be a competitive inhibitor, with a K(i) value of 1.1 uM. When the effects on NADPH-P450 reductase activity were investigated, all constituents of St. John's wort studied turned out to be rather ineffective inhibitors; quercetin was the only exception, with an IC(50) value of approximately 20 uM. These in vitro data indicate that St. John's wort extracts and some of their constituents potently inhibit the major human procarcinogen-activating enzyme CYP1A1.",

However, the mechanism of these antiretroviral activities has not been clarified. In the course of screening specific inhibitors of protein kinase C /the authors/ have found that both compounds specifically inhibit protein kinase C with IC50 values 1.7 ug/mL and 15 ug/mL, respectively, and show antiproliferative activity against mammalian cells. These data suggest that antiretroviral activity of hypericin and pseudohypericin could be attributable to the inhibition of some phosphorylation involved by protein kinase C during viral infection of cells.",

Pseudohypericin is a component of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.8X10-27 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pseudohypericin will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase pseudohypericin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Pseudohypericin contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pseudohypericin is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.3X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-29 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, pseudohypericin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 1300 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to pseudohypericin may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pseudohypericin is extracted or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to pseudohypericin via ingestion as a medication. (SRC)",

According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 1300(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 7.32(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

It was shown to reduce excess body copper storage and ameliorate symptoms of Wilson\u2019s disease. In rats with diabetes mellitus, intravenous administration of TETA led to a dose-dependent increase in urinary copper excretion.   In preliminary studies, TETA was shown to ameliorate left ventricular hypertrophy in both human and animal subjects with diabetes. In animal models, TETA was also shown to reverse manifestations of diabetic nephropathy, including nephromegaly, renal fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, and albuminuria, without lowering hyperglycemia. This finding may be explained by TETA chelating copper cations, which are pro-oxidant and activate pathways that produce excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause tissue injury. TETA was shown to possess anti-angiogenesis properties, as copper is an essential element for angiogenesis in cancer cells. TETA was shown to inhibit telomerase, suggesting that it may exhibit an inhibitory effect or cytotoxicity on tumor growth. Based on these early findings, TETA has been studied for its anticancer effects.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

TETA has the potential to chelate non-copper cations in mineral supplements and other oral drugs, resulting in altered drug absorption; thus, TETA should be administered at least one hour apart from these medications.  The median Tmax ranges from 1.25 to 2 hours. Mean Cmax (\u00b1 SD) of triethylenetetramine (TETA) was 2030 \u00b1 981 ng/mL following oral administration of 900 mg TETA and 3430 \u00b1 1480 ng/mL following administration of 1500 mg TETA. The systemic exposure (AUC) of TETA increased in a dose-proportional manner over the range of 900 mg to 1500 mg TETA. The mean AUCinf (\u00b1 SD) was 9750 \u00b1 4910 ngxh/mL at 900 mg and 17200 \u00b1 9470 ngxh/mL at 1500 mg.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

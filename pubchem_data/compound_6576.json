When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 55.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dichloroacetaldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dichloroacetaldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is 7.0 days. If released to soil, dichloroacetaldehyde is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4.3. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.42X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Dichloroacetaldehyde may potentially volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure of 59 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. If released into water, dichloroacetaldehyde is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon its estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.7 days and 38 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests that the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to dichloroacetaldehyde may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dichloroacetaldehyde is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that dichloroacetaldehyde is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4.7 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 38 days(SRC). Dichloroacetaldehyde's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of dichloroacetaldehyde from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure of 55.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(3).",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Pharmacokinetic variations may in some cases be compensated by individual dosage adjustments based on plasma drug level measurements. The interpatient variability in response to certain time-course of drug concentrations at the receptor site could hitherto only be assessed by clinical judgement. New methods for in vivo assessment of receptor occupancy hold promise for possible measurement of parameters accounting for at least part of the interindividual variation in drug response at the receptor level. Monitoring of fluphenazine, perphenazine, thiothixene and sulpiride plasma levels by specific chemical assay methods seems to offer some guidance to individualization of drug doses. Definite therapeutic plasma level ranges have not been established for chlorpromazine and haloperidol. However, monitoring plasma levels of chlorpromazine or haloperidol might be of value when drug-induced toxicity is suspected, and as a means of controlling patient compliance.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The body weight was monitored, and brain weight, total cerebral lipid content, content of individual phospholipids, incorporation of (32)P into individual phospholipids, and the fatty acids composition of phosphatidylethanolamine were measured. The prolonged treatment with neuroleptics and an antidepressant, but not with oxazepam, produced profound, often biphasic or multiphasic changes in the biochemistry of phospholipids.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

These effects are most common with low potency neuroleptic drugs. It has been hypothesized that these effects are due to the direct toxic action of these drugs on blood and liver cells. The purpose of this study is to compare the cytotoxic effects of eight neuroleptic drugs in five different biological test systems. In all of the test systems, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, fluphenzine and thiothixene (group one drugs) were the most toxic drugs and molindone was the least toxic. Thioridazine was between 25 and 84 times more toxic than molindone. Loxapine was significantly more toxic than molindone, but less toxic than the group one drugs. Haloperidol was intermediate in toxicity between the group one drugs and loxapine. /It was/ concluded that the difference in cytotoxicity of the neuroleptic drugs observed in these experiments accounts in part for the increase in agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity with thioridazine and chlorpromazine and for the lower incidence of these side effects with less toxic drugs. The possibility that tardive dyskinesia may be due to the cytotoxic effects of neuroleptic drugs is discussed and an experiment to test this hypothesis is suggested.",

The pharmacology of phenothiazines is complex, and because of their actions on the central and autonomic nervous systems, the drugs affect many different sites in the body.

Phenothiazines generally do not produce substantial cortical depression; however, there is minimal information on the specific effects of phenothiazines at the cortical level. Phenothiazines also act in the basal ganglia, exhibiting extrapyramidal effects. The precise mechanism(s) of action, including antipsychotic action, of phenothiazines has not been determined, but may be principally related to antidopaminergic effects of the drugs. There is evidence to indicate that phenothiazines antagonize dopamine-mediated neurotransmission at the synapses. There is also some evidence that phenothiazines may block postsynaptic dopamine receptor sites. However, it has not been determined whether the antipsychotic effect of the drugs is causally related to their antidopaminergic effects. Phenothiazines also have peripheral and/or central antagonistic activity against alpha-adrenergic, serotonergic, histaminic (H1-receptors), and muscarinic receptors. Phenothiazines also have some adrenergic activity, since they block the reuptake of monoamines at the presynaptic neuronal membrane, which tends to enhance neurotransmission. The effects of phenothiazines on the autonomic nervous system are complex and unpredictable because the drugs exhibit varying degrees of alpha-adrenergic blocking, muscarinic blocking, and adrenergic activity. The antipsychotic activity of phenothiazines may be related to any or all of these effects, but it has been suggested that the drugs' effects on dopamine are probably most important. It has also been suggested that effects of phenothiazines on other amines (eg, gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) or peptides (eg, substance P, endorphins) may contribute to their antipsychotic effect. Further study is needed to determine the role of central neuronal receptor antagonism and of effects on biochemical mediators in the antipsychotic action of the phenothiazines and other antipsychotic agents. /Phenothiazine General Statement/",

Several instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury have been reported due to fluphenazine, which have resembled the liver injury caused by chlorpromazine and other phenothiazines. The onset of phenothiazide-related jaundice is usually within 1 to 4 weeks, and the pattern of serum enzyme elevations is typically cholestatic or mixed. Immunoallergic features (fever, rash and eosinophilia) are present in some cases, but they are usually mild and self-limited; autoantibodies are rare. Most importantly, phenothiazide induced jaundice can be prolonged and associated with vanishing bile duct syndrome. All phenothiazine antipsychotic agents are probably capable of causing cholestatic liver injury, but the frequency of hepatotoxicity appears to be far greater with chlorpromazine than with others such as fluphenazine.",

There is no specific antidote for phenothiazine intoxication; however, anticholinergic antiparkinsonian drugs may be useful in controlling extrapyramidal reactions associated with phenothiazine overdosage. Following acute ingestion of the drugs, the stomach should be emptied by gastric lavage and consideration also should be given to repeated doses of activated charcoal. If the patient is comatose, having seizures or a dystonic reaction, or lacks the gag reflex, gastric lavage may be performed if an endotracheal tube with cuff inflated is in place to prevent aspiration of gastric contents. Gastric lavage may be useful even several hours after the drug has been ingested, since GI motility may be greatly reduced following overdosage of phenothiazines. Induction of emesis should generally not be attempted, since a phenothiazine-induced dystonic reaction of the head or neck may result in aspiration of vomitus during emesis. Administration of a saline cathartic may be beneficial in enhancing evacuation of the drug from the GI tract, especially following ingestion of extended-release preparations (eg, Spansules). /Phenothiazine General Statement/",

Treatment may include correction of electrolyte abnormalities and acid-base balance, lidocaine, phenytoin, isoproterenol, ventricular pacing, and defibrillation.  Antiarrhythmic agents that can prolong the QT interval (eg, class IA [disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine] or III agents) should be avoided in treating overdosage-associated arrhythmias in which prolongation of QTc is a manifestation. Appropriate therapy (IV fluids and a vasopressor) should be instituted if hypotension occurs; epinephrine, bretylium, or dopamine should not be used. For the management of refractory hypotension, vasopressors such as phenylephrine, levarterenol, or metaraminol may be used. Appropriate therapy should be instituted if excessive sedation occurs; CNS stimulants that may cause seizures should be avoided. If seizures occur, treatment should not include barbiturates because these drugs may potentiate phenothiazine-induced respiratory depression. Hypothermia is common and sometimes difficult to control. In some patients with acute toxicity, exchange transfusions may be useful, but hemodialysis, forced diuresis, hemoperfusion, or manipulation of urine pH is of little value in enhancing elimination of phenothiazines. /Phenothiazine General Statement/",

On both occasions blood samples were taken at intervals before and after the intravenous injection of soluble insulin (0.1 u/kg body weight). The patients were investigated on the first occasion, 2-7 days after cessation of drinking and they all demonstrated an adequate hGH response. They then received an injection of fluphenazine (Modecate 12.5 mg) and were reinvestigated 1 week later. The hGH response to hypoglycaemia was significantly impaired after treatment with fluphenazine. Basal hPRL concentrations were significantly increased and increased concentrations of hPRL in response to hypoglycaemia occurred after treatment. /Investigators/ conclude that a single injection of fluphenazine (Modecate 12.5 mg) has a marked effect on hypothalamic-pituitary mechanisms controlling hGH and hPRL release.",

Rats were divided into five groups. Two groups were given a single intragastric dose of 5 mg of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene. Animals were then given 100 or 200 mg fluphenazine 3 times per week for 30 weeks and were then examined weekly for mammary tumors. All animals that appeared moribund were killed and autopsied. All surviving animals were killed at 30 weeks, autopsied, and examined for tumors. None of the untreated control rats developed mammary tumors. One of 15 rats given 100 ug fluphenazine alone developed a mammary tumor, but none of the 15 rats given 200 ug developed tumors. Of 15 rats given 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene only, 12 developed mammary tumors for a total of 17 tumors; 50 percent of the tumors developed within 21 weeks after treatment. All animals treated with the combination of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and fluphenazine developed tumors that appeared in 50 percent of rats within 10 weeks after the secondary treatment. /It was/ concluded that fluphenazine alone does not induce tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats, but repeated fluphenazine treatment increases the number of mammary tumors in rats pretreated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and shortens the latency period.",

Shortly after the initiation of neuroleptic treatment, increased OMs were seen in the drugged animals, but these did not persist and may have reflected a decreased fear (freezing) reaction in the tranquilized animals, being correlated with increased locomotion in open field. After 7 months of neuroleptics, twitch-like movements of the orofacial region were observed in the drugged animals; these dyskinetic movements were enhanced by administration of d-amphetamine. These twitch-like movements appear to be a better model of tardive dyskinesia in the guinea pig than the initially observed and normal-appearing OMs.",

Although striatal pathologic changes are believed to underlie this potentially irreversible iatrogenic syndrome, the nature of the neuroleptic-induced neuropathology is unclear. In the present study, we treated rats with either vehicle or fluphenazine decanoate (5 mg/kg, IM) every 2 weeks for 4, 8 or 12 months. Four to nine weeks after the last injection, the animals were sacrificed and the density of cells in the central part of the striatum was measured with a computerized image-analysis system. The control and experimental animals did not differ in body weight with 4 and 8 months of treatment, but the rats treated with fluphenazine for 12 months had significantly lower body weights than comparable controls. Four months of neuroleptic use produced no significant neuropathologic changes. The animals treated with fluphenazine for 8 months had a significantly lower density of the large neurons. In the 12-month-treated group, there was no significant difference between the control and experimental animals, probably because of a 'floor effect': the density of the large neurons was significantly lower in the 12-month-treated compared to the 8-month-treated control rats.",

Three of these completed 1 full year of treatment, one injured its leg after 6 months of treatment and was killed, and another died of unknown causes after 9 months of treatment. All monkeys displayed abnormal movements corresponding to the early appearing extrapyramidal symptoms of neuroleptic-treated patients. These consisted initially of slowing or absence of volitional movement, trembling of the hands, trembling of the entire body, and general drowsy behavior. As treatment progressed, a variety of abnormal postures and movements appeared after each injection that were not exacerbated by drug withdrawal and, as tested at the end of the year, could be abolished or prevented with benztropine mesylate (0.2-0.5 mg/kg im). The three monkeys that completed 1 year of treatment with fluphenazine were then withdrawn from the drug. After withdrawal, all three developed movements similar in appearance to those of patients with tardive dyskinesia. Reinstitution of fluphenazine treatment, as tested in one monkey, abolished all movements resembling tardive dyskinesia. /Fluphenazine enanthate/",

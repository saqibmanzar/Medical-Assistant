When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Unmetabolized PhIP was also shown to be the major radioactive fraction in bile and feces from animals given a single dose by ip injection. Blood contained a small fraction of the dose and the major, persistently-bound form of PhIP in the blood was to hemoglobin. At 12 hr after administration of the dose the colon and cecum contained the highest concentration of radioactivity, while at later times the kidney and liver showed the highest concentration.

Autoradiography of mice injected iv with (2-14)C-PhIP (1.4 mg/kg) during late gestation showed a high and selective localization of radioactivity in the pigmented parts of the fetal eye and a moderate level of radioactivity in the fetal liver, gastro-intestinal contents, urine and in the uterine fluid. HPLC analysis of stomach contents and tissues of newborn mice exposed for 4 hr to lactating dams dosed ip with (3)H-PhIP (5.2 mg/kg) showed the presence of unchanged PhIP suggesting excretion of PhIP in the milk of the dams.

The enzymes cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2) and N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) are principally implicated in such biotransformations ... The relationship between the activity of these two enzymes and the urinary excretion of unmetabolized and Phase II conjugates of the two HAAs MeIQx (2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline) and PhIP (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) /was determined/ in individuals fed a uniform diet containing high-temperature cooked meat. The subjects in the study ate meat containing known amounts of MeIQx and PhIP, and urine collections were made 0-12 and 12-24 hr after a meal. MeIQx and PhIP were measured in urine after acid treatment that quantitatively hydrolyzes the Phase II conjugates to the respective parent amine. The extracts containing the HAAs were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and analyzed by liquid chromatography using electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. The MeIQx content in the 0-12 hr urine increased after acid hydrolysis by a factor of 3-21-fold. After acid treatment, the total amount of MelQx (unmetabolized plus the N2-glucuronide and sulfamate metabolites) excreted in the 0-12 hr urine was 10.5 +/- 3.5% (mean +/- SD) of the dose, whereas the total amount of PhIP (unmetabolized plus acid-labile conjugate(s)) in the 0-12 hr period was 4.3 +/- 1.7% (mean +/- SD) of the dose. The total amount of PhIP in the 12-24 hr urine after acid treatment was 0.9 +/- 0.4% (mean +/- SD) of the dose. Linear regression analysis of the amounts of MeIQx and PhIP excreted in the 0-12 hr period expressed as a percentage of the ingested dose, for all subjects, gave a low but significant correlation (r = 0.37, P = 0.005). Linear regression analyses showed that lower total MeIQx (unmetabolized plus the N2-glucuronide and sulfamate metabolites) in urine was associated with higher CYP1A2 activity, whereas total PhIP (unmetabolized plus conjugated) in urine showed no association to CYP1A2 activity. These results indicate that in humans, MeIQx metabolism and disposition are more strongly influenced by CYP1A2 activity than are those of PhIP. Linear regression analysis found no association between NAT2 activity and the levels (unmetabolized plus acid-labile conjugates) of MeIQx or PhIP excreted in urine.",

The study consisted of three 12-day phases, namely two periods of avoidance of cruciferous vegetables (phases 1 and 3) and a high cruciferous vegetable diet period (phase 2), when subjects ingested 250 g each of Brussels sprouts and broccoli per day. At the end of each study phase, the subjects consumed a cooked meat meal containing 4.90 ug PhIP and urine samples were collected for up to 48 h. Cruciferous vegetable consumption significantly increased hepatic CYP1A2, as demonstrated by changes in saliva caffeine kinetics. ... In phases 1 and 3, the excretion of N(2)-hydroxy-N(2)-PhIP-glucuronide  in 0-48 hr urine samples was six times that of N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(3)-glucuronide. Cruciferous vegetable consumption significantly increased the urinary excretion of N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(2)-glucuronide in 0-48 hr urine samples to 127 and 136% of levels observed in phases 1 and 3, respectively. In contrast, the urinary excretion of N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(3)-glucuronide was unchanged. While the urinary excretion of both PhIP metabolites accounted for approximately 39% of the PhIP dose in phases 1 and 3, they accounted for approximately 49% of the dose in phase 2. This study demonstrates that cruciferous vegetable consumption can induce both the phase I and II metabolism of PhIP in humans.",

Dose had little effect on the profile of metabolites in the urine but did influence the profile in the feces. PhIP was more efficiently metabolized at higher doses. In addition, rats were pretreated with Aroclor 1254 (PCB), 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), phenobarbital (PB), PhIP and corn oil prior to a single dose of (14)C-PhIP, and compared with a control group receiving (14)C-PhIP only. The major metabolites in the urine and feces were quantitated for each group, as well as PhIP binding to serum proteins, hemoglobin and selected tissues. Pretreatment with MC and PCB resulted in an increase in the amount of 4'-hydroxylation of PhIP and a decrease in the amount of N-hydroxylated metabolites in the urine. Pretreatment with PB resulted in an increase in the amount of N-hydroxylated metabolites, but a decrease in 4'-hydroxylation. Pretreatment with either MC or PCB resulted in an increase in PhIP binding to the liver and kidney, while reducing the binding in other tissues. Animals pretreated with PhIP showed few significant differences from the untreated group, while pretreatment with PB in general resulted in a decrease of PhIP binding in tissues.",

Normal (Apc(+/+)) and pre-malignant (Apc(Min/+), where Min=multiple intestinal neoplasia) colonic epithelial cells of mice can be used to study promotion of carcinogenesis ... The metabolism of (14)C-PhIP /was investigated/ in these two murine cell lines. Cells induced by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) metabolized PhIP into 4'-OH-PhIP as the main metabolite in PhiP detoxification. Besides, 5-OH-PhIP was identified, revealing the formation of intermediary reactive metabolites, since it results from a degradation of conjugates of N-acetoxy-PhIP. Apc(Min/+) cells produce significantly higher amounts of these metabolites. Demethylated metabolites are also observed, indicating that the colon contains a significant CYP1 family dependent metabolic activity. A minor hydroxy-glucuronide-PhIP metabolite is observed in Apc(Min/+) cells, the glucuronidation being known as an important step in the detoxification pathway. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments demonstrate that induction by TCDD has prevailing effects in gene expression of CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 in Apc(Min/+) cells. In these cells, N-acetyltransferase-2 is also expressed at higher levels. So, the more important potency to metabolically bio-activate PhIP, as measured in Apc(Min/+) cells, can be linked to a higher probability to generate new in situ mutations.",

In 3-methylcholanthrene-induced mice administered 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg/kg (14C)PhIP (ip), urinary and fecal excretion over 24 hr accounted for 16% and 42-56% of the dose respectively. Urinary excretion of unchanged parent compound accounted for only 0.5-0.8% of the administered dose. At all doses, the major urinary metabolite was identified as 4'-(2-amino-1-methylimidazo[4,5-b]pyrid-6-yl)phenyl sulfate and this metabolite comprised approximately 5% of the dose. Uninduced mice excreted greater than 13% of a 10 mg/kg dose as the sulfate conjugate. Urinary excretion of both 2-amino-1-methyl-6-(4'-hydroxy)-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (4'-hydroxy-PhIP) and a glucuronide conjugate of 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenyl-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (N-hydroxy-PhIP) was also higher (4-fold) in uninduced versus induced mice. The decreased urinary excretion of P450-derived metabolites via induction contrasted with increased metabolite formation by hepatic microsomal preparations. 4'-Hydroxy-PhIP and N-hydroxy-PhIP were produced in amounts nearly 7- and 3-fold higher respectively by induced versus uninduced microsomal incubations at 50 uM (3)H-PhIP. At concentrations less than 10 uM, PhIP was almost exclusively converted by the induced preparations to an unidentified metabolite that was not retained by the C18 column. This metabolite, which also was formed in incubations with either 4'-hydroxy-PhIP or N-hydroxy-PhIP, was produced by microsomes from uninduced animals at a much slower rate. Covalent binding to microsomal protein in incubations with (3)H-PhIP was concentration-dependent and 2- to 4-fold higher in induced than uninduced preparations. Covalent binding in liver and kidney of induced mice administered (14)C-PhIP was dose dependent. At 10 mg/kg PhIP, adducts were produced at 1.7-fold higher levels in livers of induced versus uninduced mice, but renal binding was higher in uninduced animals. These studies indicate the importance of cytochrome P450 and other xenobiotic enzymes in the metabolism, disposition and activation of PhIP.",

It is now known that metabolic activation leading to the formation of DNA adducts is critical for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of these compounds. All of the AIAs studied adduct to the guanine base, the major adduct being formed at the C8 position. Two AIAs, IQ and MeIQx, also form minor adducts at the N2 position of guanine. A growing body of literature has reported on the mutation spectra induced by AIA-guanine adducts.

This PhIP-induced pituitary cell proliferation and synthesis and secretion of prolactin can be attenuated by an estrogen receptor (ER) inhibitor, implying that PhIP effects on lactotroph responses are ERalpha mediated. In view of the strong association between estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and breast cancer, the PhIP repertoire of hormone-like activities provides further mechanistic support for the tissue-specific carcinogenicity of the chemical. Furthermore, the recent epidemiology studies that report an association between consumption of cooked red meat and premenopausal and postmenopausal human breast cancer are consonant with these observations.",

In addition to its genotoxic properties, recent studies have shown that PhIP can activate estrogen receptor-mediated signaling pathways at doses that are similar to those that may be present in the body following consumption of a cooked meat meal ... /This/ study ... examined whether such doses of PhIP can affect estrogen receptor-independent signal transduction via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway to influence proliferation and migration in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A and the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. At doses shown to have a proliferative effect on MCF10A cells (10-11 to 10-7 mol/L), PhIP induced a rapid, transient increase in phosphorylation of both MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2 and ERKs. Inhibition of this pathway significantly reduced the PhIP-induced proliferation of MCF10A cells and the migration of PC-3 cells. The data presented here show that levels of PhIP that approximate to human dietary exposure stimulate cellular signaling pathways and result in increased growth and migration, processes linked to the promotion and progression of neoplastic disease. These findings provide strong evidence that PhIP acts as a tumor initiator and promoter and that dietary exposure to this compound could contribute to carcinogenesis in humans."

Similarly, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine (PhIP)-induced colon tumors in the rat have increased beta-catenin and elevated Bcl-2. To examine the possible direct transcriptional regulation of rat Bcl-2 by beta-catenin/Tcf, /the authors/cloned and characterized the corresponding promoter region and found 70.1% similarity with its human counterpart, BCL2. Bcl-2 promoter activity was increased in response to LiCl and exogenous beta-catenin, including oncogenic mutants of beta-catenin found in PhIP-induced colon tumors. Protein/DNA arrays identified E2F1, but not beta-catenin/Tcf, as interacting most strongly with the rat Bcl-2 promoter. Exogenous E2F1 increased the promoter activity of rat Bcl-2, except in mutants lacking the E2F1 sites. As expected, beta-catenin induced its downstream target c-Myc, as well as E2F1 and Bcl-2, and this was blocked by siRNA to c-Myc or E2F1. These findings suggest an indirect pathway for Bcl-2 over-expression in PhIP-induced colon tumors involving beta-catenin, c-Myc and E2F1.",

It is formed naturally during the cooking of muscle-derived foods (meat and fish) as by-products of the Maillard (or browning) reaction. It is postulated that the amino-imidazo part of /heterocyclic amines/ (HCAs) is formed from creatine, while the remaining parts of the compound are likely formed from Strecker degradation products, such as pyridines or pyrazines, which are formed in the Maillard reaction between hexose sugars and amino acids. Formation of HCAs in food reportedly is affected by temperature, processing time, acidity, precursor concentrations, and types of amino acid present. In general, higher temperatures and longer cooking times increase the amount of HCAs produced. HCA formation also increases with cooking methods that use direct or efficient transfer of heat from the source to the food; frying or grilling of muscle meats produces more HCAs than do indirect-heat methods such as stewing, steaming, or poaching.[DHHS/National Toxicology Program; Eleventh Report on Carcinogens: 2-Amino-1-Methyl-6-Phenylimidazo",

GC-MS showed that naringenin dose dependently reduced the level of phenylacetaldehyde, a key intermediate on the pathway to the formation of PhIP. Subsequent LC-MS analyses of samples from a wide range of model systems consisting of PhIP precursors, including phenylalanine, glucose, and creatinine, suggested that naringenin scavenged phenylacetaldehyde via adduct formation. An isotope-labeling study showed that the postulated adducts contain fragment(s) of phenylalanine origin. Direct reaction employing phenylacetaldehyde and naringenin further confirmed the capability of naringenin to form adducts with phenylacetaldehyde, thus reducing its availability for PhIP formation. Two of the adducts were subsequently isolated and purified. Their structure was elucidated by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy as 8-C-(E-phenylethenyl)naringenin (1) and 6- C-( E-phenylethenyl)naringenin (2), respectively, suggesting that C-6 and C-8 are two of the active sites of naringenin in adduct formation. These two adducts were also identified from thermally processed beef models, highlighting phenylacetaldehyde trapping as a key mechanism of naringenin to inhibit PhIP formation.",

Effects of combined treatment with sodium nitrite (NaNO(2)) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) ... were assessed with regard to mammary tumor induction in female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Animals at 6 wk of age were given intragastric doses of 100 mg/kg bw of PhIP twice a week for 4 wk, during which period 0 or 0.2% NaNO(2) was administered in the drinking water. Control rats received 0.2% NaNO(2) alone for the 4 wk or non-supplemented water during the entire 48 wk experimental period, without carcinogen treatment. The first tumor in the PhIP+NaNO(2) group appeared significantly later than with PhIP alone, and during the experimental period, the incidence, multiplicity and volume of mammary tumors in this group tended towards decreased, although values did not significantly differ at the terminal sacrifice. These results indicate that NaNO(2) does not enhance PhIP-induced rat mammary carcinogenesis, rather possessing some potential for inhibition.",

Co-administration of 1.45 umol PhIP/kg bw and 30 umol quercetin/kg bw significantly increased the blood AUC(0-8 hr) of PhIP in rats to 131+/-14% of the AUC (0-8 hr) for rats dosed with PhIP alone. Significantly increased blood PhIP levels were detected at 15, 30, 45 and 180 min. At 4 and 8 hr post-dosing a difference in the PhIP levels in the blood between the two treatment groups was no longer observed. In vitro and in silico modeling of PhIP transport using Caco-2 cells and a previously described kinetic model for PhIP transport revealed that the relative increase in PhIP transport caused by quercetin is dependent on the concentration of the two compounds. When substituting the PhIP and quercetin concentrations used in the in vivo experiment in the kinetic model, an effect of quercetin on PhIP transport was predicted that matches the actual effect of 131% observed in vivo. It is concluded that quercetin increases the bioavailability of the pro-carcinogen PhIP in rats pointing at a potential adverse effect of this supposed beneficial food ingredient.",

PhIP-DNA adducts were detected in 53 N, 34 A, and 39 T samples. Mean values (+/-SD) of the absorbency for PhIP staining were 0.22+/-0.04, 0.24+/-0.04, and 0.24+/-0.03 for N, A, and T samples, respectively (p = 0.004). Using the median absorbency (0.21) of the samples from normal controls as the cut-off, 71% of A and 77% of T tissues, compared with 48% of N tissues, were distributed in the higher range (p = 0.009). The odds ratio of pancreatic cancer was 3.4 (95% confidence interval 1.5-7.5, p = 0.002) for individuals with a higher level of PhIP-DNA adducts. This is the first report of the detection of PhIP-DNA adducts in human pancreatic tissue samples obtained from patients with unknown exposure to HCA. Although limited by the small sample size, these preliminary results suggest that PhIP exposure may contribute to human pancreatic cancer development."

To investigate the hypothesis that PhIP exposure increases PC risk, an ongoing prospective clinic-based study compared PC screening outcomes with survey-based estimates of dietary PhIP intake among 40-70-year-old African-American men with no prior PC ... They completed food-frequency and meat-cooking/consumption questionnaires and had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and digital-rectal exam. Results for 392 men indicated a 17 (+/-17) ng/kg day mean (+/-1 sd) daily intake of PhIP, about twice that of white US men of similar age. PhIP intake was attributable mostly to chicken (61%) and positively associated (R(2) = 0.32, P < 0.0001) with saturated fat intake. An odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 31 (3.1-690) for highly elevated PSA > or = 20 ng/mL was observed in the highest 15% vs lowest 50% of estimated daily PhIP intake (> or = 30 vs < or = 10 ng/kg day) among men 50+ years old (P = 0.0002 for trend) and remained significant after adjustment for self-reported family history of (brother or father) PC, saturated fat intake and total energy intake. PSA measures were higher in African-American men with positive family history (P = 0.007 all men, P < 0.0001 highest PSA quartile). These preliminary results are consistent with a positive association between PhIP intake and highly elevated PSA, supporting the hypothesis that dietary intervention may help reduce PC risk.",

Beginning 2 wk after a single diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection (200 mg/kg, ip), rats received MeA alpha C or PhIP in the diet at various doses for 6 wk. All rats were subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PH) 1 wk after the test agents were added to the diet and were killed 8 wk after DEN initiation. MeA alpha C (100, 200, 400, and 800 ppm) significantly increased numbers and areas of GST-P+ foci over control levels in all dose groups with a clear dose-response. In contrast, PhIP (50, 100, 20,0 and 400 ppm) only equivocally increased foci development in the highest dose group and rather was associated with decrease in the lower dose groups. DNA adduct formation assessed by (32)P-postlabeling demonstrated a dose-dependent increase with both chemicals, the levels being much higher with MeA alpha C. Thus, two highly mutagenic heterocyclic amines that are produced in broiled foodstuffs exerted different influence on GST-P+ foci development and DNA adduct formation; these findings are consistent with liver carcinogenicity in rats and/or mice.",

The mechanisms leading to this difference /were investigated/ by measuring the level of PhIP-DNA adducts, the enhancement of cell proliferation and aberrant crypt focus (ACF) formation in colon mucosa. PhIP was administered in the diet at a level of 0.04% to both male and female F344 rats for 1-8 wk. The level of DNA adducts in the colon mucosa was measured using the (32)P-postlabeling method. Four major PhIP-DNA adducts were detected in fairly constant proportions in all the animals examined. The level of PhIP-DNA adducts in male and female rats was the same, indicating no direct correlation between adduct levels and carcinogenesis. Labeling indices (LIs) were determined by measuring BrdU incorporation in rats after feeding with a PhIP diet for 4, 8, and 12 wk. After 8 wk administration the LI had increased 1.5-fold in the colon of the male rats, but no increase was observed in the female rats. ACF formation was examined after feeding with a PhIP diet for 14 weeks. The number of aberrant crypt foci was 6.6 +/- 1.5 per rat in males and 1.9 +/- 0.5 per rat in females. Thus differences in colon tumor development in male and female rats takes place at an early stage(s). The results suggest that, in addition to DNA adduct formation, enhanced proliferation contributes to the formation of ACFs, which are premalignant lesions of the colon.",

The induction of foci of aberrant crypts in the colon, was used to explore the interaction between dietary fat and calcium. Male F344 rats 6 weeks of age were placed on diets containing 5 or 20% corn oil, and 0.04 or 0.32% calcium ion, as calcium lactate. Each dietary group was fed 400 ppm 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhlP), and negative controls received the diets alone. A positive control group was given 2 mg N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU) intrarectally four times in a 2-week period. All rats were killed after 9 weeks. The intestinal tract was rinsed with Krebs-Ringer buffer. After staining a 6-cm segment of the descending colon and rectum with 0.2% methylene blue, foci of aberrant crypts were evaluated microscopically. With PhlP as a carcinogen, the rats on a high-fat, low-calcium level had more foci of aberrant crypts than animals on a low-fat level. With the higher calcium level, there were fewer foci and aberrant crypts, but the effect of fat was still significant. With NMU and a low-calcium level, the effect of fat level was evident. However, with the higher calcium intake, there were considerably more foci of aberrant crypts than on the low-calcium level, and the effect of the dietary fat level was not obvious.",

Its limited production and use for research purposes may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.1X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 2.0X10+4. The pKa of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine is estimated as 5.4, indicating that this compound will partially exist in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-13 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 14 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Limited occupational exposure to 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine via ingestion of cooked foods. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

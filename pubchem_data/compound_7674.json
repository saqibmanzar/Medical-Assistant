ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toluene induced cells of Pseudomonas putida F39/D transformed anisole to a compound tentatively identified as cis-1,2-dihydroxy-3-methoxycyclohexa-3,5-diene, 2-methoxyphenol, catechol, and trace amounts of phenol while phenetole was converted primarily to cis-1,2-dihydroxy-3-ethoxycyclohexa-3,5-diene and 2-ethoxyphenol. Induced cells of Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816/11 and Beijerinckia sp. B8/36 transformed anisole to phenol, and phenetole to phenol and ethenyloxybenzene. Toluene induced cells of P. putida BG1 converted anisole to phenol but did not oxidize phenetole. In contrast, toluene induced cells of P. mendocina KRl, which oxidize toluene via monooxygenation at the para position, transformed anisole to 4-methoxyphenol, and phenetole to 2-, 3-and 4-ethoxyphenol. The involvement of toluene and naphthalene dioxygenases in the reactions catalyzed by strains F39/D and NCIB 9816/11, respectively, was confirmed with recombinant E. coli strains expressing the cloned dioxygenase genes. The results show that the oxygenases from different Pseudomonas strains oxidize anisole and phenetole to different hydroxylated products.",

Phenetole has been identified in lake water. If released to soil, phenetole will have low mobility. Volatilization of phenetole may be important from moist and dry soil surfaces. Biodegradation of phenetole is expected to be an important fate process in soil and water according to two biodegradation studies. If released to water, phenetole may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Phenetole would volatilize from water surfaces with estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake of 5 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 48 suggests that bioconcentration of phenetole may be moderate, not high. If released to the atmosphere, phenetole will exist in the vapor phase. Vapor-phase phenetole is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 14 hours. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

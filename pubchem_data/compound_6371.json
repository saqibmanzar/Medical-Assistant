When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The nasopharyngeal fraction of total respiratory tract carbon-14 was higher in rabbits and guinea pigs (0.46 - 0.50) than in the other species (0.22 - 0.36). Tracheal carbon-14 was always about 3% of total respiratory tract carbon-14. Liver carbon-14 was about 1% of lung concentrations. Tissue binding of phosgene was shown by a large percentage of carbon-14 in trichloroacetic acid precipitates of tissue and by the presence of carbon-14 in lungs (20% of initial) 3 days post exposure.",

Kidney homogenates of sensitive male DBA/2J mice metabolized chloroform to phosgene more rapidly than did the less sensitive C57BL/6J mice.

Treatment of female mice with testosterone, however, reversed this trend. Cytochrome P450 in the microsomal and mitochondrial fraction of the kidney appeared to catalyze the metabolism of chloroform to phosgene.",

This activity potentially results from at least two separate chemical reactions: acylation and hydrolysis. Acylation, the more important and rapid mechanism, results from the reaction of phosgene with nucleophilic moieties, such as the amino, hydroxyl, and sulfhydryl groups of tissue macromolecules. Acylation causes destruction of proteins and lipids, irreversible alterations of membrane structures, and disruption of enzyme and other cell functions. Exposure to phosgene depletes lung nucleophiles, particularly glutathione, and restoration of glutathione seems to protect against phosgene-induced injury. For several days after acute phosgene exposure, tissue levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase, increase as part of the lungs' response to injury. In addition to acylation, phosgene is hydrolyzed to HCl ... The formation of HCl occurs on moist membranes and may cause irritation and tissue damage. Because of the limited water solubility of phosgene, it is unlikely that large quantities of HCl could result from the exposure of biological tissues. However, small amounts do form and may contact moist membranes of the eye, nasopharynx, and respiratory tract. Hydrolysis to HCl is the probable cause of immediate inflammation and discomfort after phosgene exposure at concentrations greater than 3 ppm (>12 mg/cu m). Pulmonary cellular glycolysis and oxygen uptake following phosgene exposure are depressed and, thus, leads to a corresponding decrease in the levels of intracellular adenosine triphosphate and cyclic adenosine monophosphate. This is associated with increased water uptake by epithelial, interstitial, and endothelial cells. The semipermeability of the blood-air barrier becomes gradually compromised as a result of fluid entering the interstitial and alveolar spaces. Later, the blood-air barrier disrupts, opening channels for the flooding of alveoli. Compression of pulmonary microvasculature leads to the opening of arteriovenous shunt. The onset of pulmonary edema correlates temporally with the decrease in adenosine triphosphate levels. Interventions that increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, such as treatment with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., aminophylline), beta-adrenergic agonists (e.g., isoproterenol), or cyclic adenosine monophosphate analogs, markedly reduce pulmonary edema formation in animals exposed to phosgene.",

It was used during WWI by the German army, and has since become part of the chemical arsenal of many countries including the United States. Small amounts of phosgene (CG) exist naturally in the atmosphere from the breakdown of chlorinated compounds. Phosgene is used in the preparation and manufacture of many organic chemicals especially in the dye, pharmaceutical, herbicide, insecticide, metal ore extraction, synthetic foam, resin, polymer, and chlorinating agent industries. Phosgene (CG) may also be released from household paint removers and degreasers when they are used in the presence of heat. Phosgene (CG) is shipped as a liquefied compressed gas in steel cylinders. At low concentrations, phosgene (CG) smells like newly mown hay or green corn. At high concentrations, phosgene (CG) has a strong, suffocating, unpleasant odor. However, the odor is only detectable for a short amount of time when phosgene (CG) is initially released and should not be depended on as a reliable indicator of overexposure.",

In its first application, phosgene was the most heavily used chemical-warfare agent during World War I . Its utility as a reactive chemical intermediate is of relatively recent origin. It is now an important and widely used intermediate; the majority of its production is captive, e.g., in the manufacture of other chemicals within the same plant. The principal use of phosgene is in the polyurethane industry, which consumes over 85% of the world's phosgene output. ...",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this moldy smelling, colorless gas may occur from its use in the manufacture of toluene diisocyanate (TDI), methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), dyestuffs, polymeric isocyanates, and polycarbonate resins. It is also important to note that certain chlorinated solvents (eg, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and methylene chloride) can decompose to phosgene in the presence of fire, heaters, or welding operations. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, shortness of breath, chest pain, severe pulmonary edema (sometimes delayed up to 24 hr), and death. Both the OSHA PEL is set at a TWA of 0.1 ppm. Ventilation systems should be used to prevent hazardous levels of phosgene from accumulating. In activities or situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus, and full (encapsulating) protective clothing designed specifically to protect against phosgene. If contact should occur, immediately flush the affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. While phosgene does not ignite easily, it can burn, and cylinders may explode in the heat of a fire. For fires involving phosgene, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, standard or alcohol foams or water. Fight the fire from a maximum distance and dike runoff from fire control water. Phosgene may be shipped via rail (cargo only), road, and water, in containers bearing the label \"Poison gas\". Phosgene should be stored in cool, dry, well-ventilated areas, secured, and away from sources of ignition and physical damage. If small leaks of phosgene occur, first isolate the area for 600 feet in all directions (large spills are isolated in all directions for 1200 ft). Stop the flow of gas if it can be done without risk, using water spray to reduce vapor. Sodium hydroxide or anhydrous ammonia have been used to neutralize phosgene. Keep liquid runoff from entering water sources and sewers. Also, gas leaks may be allowed to flow into a mixed solution of caustic soda and slaked lime. Waste phosgene is a potential candidate for rotary kiln or fluidized bed forms of incineration. Before implementing land disposal of waste phosgene, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

As a result, the British soaked their H-Helmet in the Russian solution and added an outlet valve to reduce the carbon dioxide buildup inside the mask. The British Army called the new device the \"PH-Helmet.\" ... Although the PH-Helmet successfully blocked phosgene, it had serious drawbacks: it was hot, stuffy, and emitted an unpleasant odor; it also offered little protection against dense concentrations of lachrymatory agents. To counteract both phosgene and the lachrymating agents, the British in early 1916 took an entirely different approach to protective masks by developing a two-piece device called the \"Large Box\" or \"Tar Box Respirator.\" ... The first significant French protective device, the M-2 mask, was similar in design to the British H-Helmet, except it did not cover the entire head, but took the form of a \"snout\" similar to a feedbag for a horse...",

The phosgene exposure caused coughing, throat irritation, vertigo, emesis and epigastric pain. After 3-4 hr first symptoms of lung edema formation were observed. Patients showed lung rales, cyanosis, bradypnea and frothy sputum. Three patients died 4-6 hr postexposure. All of the severely poisoned patients showed lowered blood pressure and severe tachycardia. Patients surviving for 6-36 hr showed hemoconcentration, increased blood viscosity and hematin in the serum. One patient who survived for 11 days sometimes showed impaired consciousness and delirium. Histopathological lung examinations showed bronchi and respiratory bronchioles filled with desquamated epithelial cells, leukocytes and mucus, some alveoli filled with serous transudate, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates and capillary damage.",

Of these attacks, 10 were carried out with chemical weapons (four with sarin, four with VX, one with phosgene, and one with hydrogen cyanide) and seven attempted attacks were carried out with biological agents (four with anthrax and three with botulinum toxin, although in both cases the microbial strains were apparently nonvirulent). In addition to these cases, Aum is alleged to have killed 20 of its dissident members with VX and has been linked more tenuously to more than 19 other CBW attacks and attempted attacks...",

The primary route of exposure is by inhalation, the gas penetrates into the tissues of the respiratory tract and so only minimal amounts of phosgene are distributed in the body. The very short half-life (0.026 seconds) in aqueous solutions precludes a significant retention of phosgene in the body. ... The hydrolytic products of phosgene, i.e., hydrochloric acid and carbon dioxide, are disposed of by the body through normal physiological processes. Phosgene exerts its toxicity through acylation of proteins, as well as through the production of hydrochloric acid. The amino, hydroxyl and sulfhydryl groups in the protein appear to be the target for acylation leading to marked inhibition of several enzymes related to energy metabolism and a breakdown of the blood:air barrier. In all species studied, the lung is the major target organ. ... In all species the characteristic pathological feature is the delayed clinical manifestation of pulmonary edema, which is dose-dependent. Pathological changes in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli at low concentrations are typical of a pulmonary irritant, whereas at higher exposures pulmonary edema occurs, leading to interference with gas exchange and death. ... Phosgene exposure can result in eye and skin irritation. ... The target organ in humans, as in experimental animals, is the lung. After exposure to phosgene levels between 120 and 1200 mg/cu m-min, three distinct clinical clinicopathological phases have been reported. The initial phase consists of pain in the eyes and throat and tightness in the chest, often with shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing; hypotension, bradycardia and rarely sinus arrhythmias can occur. The second or latent phase, which is often asymptomatic, can last as long as 24 hr depending upon the level and duration of exposure. In the third phase, pulmonary edema may develop, leading to death in some cases. Populations exposed to phosgene after industrial accidents have reported a wide variety of symptoms, including headache, nausea, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, pharyngeal pain, chest tightness and pain, intense pain in the eye and severe lacrimation. ... In view of the lack of exposure data ... the conclusions regarding the chronic effects of phosgene that can be drawn are limited.",

Diller separated patients into three triage groups according to their initial symptoms: light exposure, serious exposure, & early pulmonary edema. The light exposure group can be identified as those who smelled phosgene but who had no initial symptoms. He recommends monitoring these patients for at least 8 hr, obtaining a chest radiogram 8 hr following exposure. Discharge would then be reasonable if the physical exam & chest radiogram were normal @ that time. The serious exposure group is identified by the presence of initial ocular or pharyngeal irritation. These patients will probably require oxygen therapy. They should be monitored closely for the development of pulmonary edema. The early pulmonary edema group is identified by dyspnea upon presentation & needs to be transported emergently to an intensive care setting. Although the initial management is complicated by a somewhat prolonged latency period, supportive measures, such as oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, & frequent suctioning, should be used as needed. Hypotension & pulmonary edema might be best managed with central venous monitoring. Steroids have been used empirically to reduce inflammation. Aminocaproic acid therapy has been advocated because it has been shown to reduce pulmonary edema in rats with moderate phosgene poisoning; however, there is no evidence that this is beneficial in humans & currently is not recommended as std therapy.",

The most important things to do for such a casualty are to ensure he is free from contamination (he is out of the smoke or wearing his mask) and is kept completely at rest. Complete rest is extremely important. There were instances in World War I in which phosgene casualties who were breathing comfortably at rest collapsed and died after walking a few yards. Even a little exertion can greatly intensify the effects of these agents. A casualty who is short of breath requires assisted ventilation with oxygen, or oxygen alone. A dyspneic casualty must be evacuated as quickly as possible to a medical facility that can provide intensive pulmonary care. A casualty who becomes dyspneic within the first few hours after exposure will probably not survive, even with intensive care.",

Skin contact can result in lesions similar to those from frostbite or burns. Following exposure to high concentrations of phosgene, a person may develop fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) within 2 to 6 hours. Exposure to phosgene may cause delayed effects that may not be apparent for up to 48 hours after exposure, even if the person feels better or appears well following removal from exposure. Therefore, people who have been exposed to phosgene should be monitored for 48 hours afterward. Delayed effects that can appear for up to 48 hours include the following: Difficulty breathing; Coughing up white to pink-tinged fluid (a sign of pulmonary edema); Low blood pressure; Heart failure.",

Its additional uses in dye manufacture, plastics, acid chlorination processes, as a phosgenation reagent, its uses in metallurgy to separate ores by chlorination of metal oxides, and its use as a chemical warfare gas may also result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. Phosgene is produced in the earth's atmosphere from the degradation of a variety of chlorinated compounds including tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, chloroform, methylchloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1420 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates phosgene will exist solely in the gas phase in the atmosphere. Gas-phase phosgene will be slowly degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 44 years. Phosgene does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, phosgene is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2.2. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Phosgene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, phosgene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Rapid hydrolysis suggests that bioconcentration will not be an important environmental fate process. Hydrolysis of a 1% solution of phosgene in water is complete within 20 seconds at 0 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to phosgene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where phosgene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to phosgene via inhalation of ambient air. Its use as a chemical war gas makes military personnel susceptible to exposure via inhalation. (SRC)",

Its additional uses in dye manufacture(1,2), plastics(3), acid chlorination processes(4,5), as a phosgenation reagent(4), its uses in metallurgy to separate ores by chlorination of metal oxides(6), and its use as a chemical warfare gas(2) may also result in its release to the environment through various waste streams(SRC). Because of its hazard, phosgene is used captively(5) and therefore emissions resulting from industrial use would be localized. Phosgene may be formed at high temperature from the oxidation of chlorinated solvents and is released during the combustion of refuse, coal, and plastics(5,7,8). It is also produced in the photooxidation of chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and tetrachlorobiphenyl(7,9) and is released when electric arc welding is performed in air containing trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and methyl chloroform(10).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(4). Phosgene has been reported to hydrolyze rapidly in seawater(5). Hydrolysis of a 1% solution of phosgene in water is complete within 20 seconds at 0 \u00b0C(6). Measured aqueous phase hydrolysis rate constants for phosgene have ranged from 0.29 to 100 sec-1(7). The rapid hydrolysis suggests that bioconcentration will not be an important environmental fate process(SRC). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2007).",

Gas-phase phosgene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 44 years(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.0X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Phosgene does not absorb UV radiation at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore would not be subject to direct photolysis by sunlight in the troposphere. Phosgene's hydrolytic half-life in the atmosphere, extrapolating from high temperature data, is 113 yr at sea level, assuming 10 torr of water vapor(5).",

Phosgene is expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the presence of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Phosgene has been reported to hydrolyze rapidly in seawater(4). Hydrolysis of a 1% solution of phosgene in water is complete within 20 seconds at 0 \u00b0C(5). Measured aqueous phase hydrolysis rate constants for phosgene have ranged from 0.29 to 100 sec-1(6). Phosgene does not absorb UV radiation at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and therefore would not be subject to direct photolysis by sunlight in the troposphere.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In 1976-78, phosgene concentrations ranging from 0.05-0.19 ug/cu m with a mean concentration of 0.08 ug/cu m were found. In 1983, the range and mean concentrations were 0.29-0.78 ug/cu m and 0.45 ug/cu m(4).

The concn of phosgene formed during electric arc welding in the presence of 2-30 ppm of tetrachloroethylene was 0.20 to 1.7 ppm, a value which is much higher than that which is emitted during welding in the presence of trichloroethylene or methyl chloroform(2). Sampling was done at a distance of 30 cm and at an angle of 45 deg above the welding arc. In another case, a phosgene concn of 1.2 ppm was found in the vicinity of welders who complained of noxious odors(3). Personal air samples ranged from 0-0.02 ppm and fixed samplers showed concns of 0-0.12 ppm over the 2 mo study except for 5 higher values, reportedly due to leaks(3). A survey of an isocyanate manufacturing plant resulted in phosgene levels ranging from 0-3.25 ppm(3). 31 of the 91 samples were negative and most of the samples were below 0.1 ppm(3). A later study of an isocyanate manufacturing plant found 91% of the air samples within the maximum permissible concn(3). Workroom air samples in a pesticide production plant in Russia showed phosgene concn commonly ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 ppm(3). Most of the phosgene was released during the disassembly and repair of pumps(3).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This process, which employs nitric acid as the nitrating agent, is based on a free radical reaction, in which the active species is the NO2 radical. This procedure produces a nitroalkane mixture rich in nitropropanes. The process is used by Angus Chemical Company for bulk production of nitromethane, nitroethane, 1-nitropropane, and 2-nitropropane. The reaction is carried out at 350 - 450 \u00b0C. At this temperature all participants in the reaction are gaseous. The reaction is fast but not too fast, so that good temperature control is still assured. The pressure is adjusted to 0.8 - 1.2 MPa, so that the reaction product leaving the reactor can be condensed without liquefying the hydrocarbon. ... Individual nitroalkanes are then obtained as pure products by fractional column distillation.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

HUMAN STUDIES: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and intermittent diarrhea and headaches occurred in men exposed at 20 to 45 ppm of 1-NP during a dipping processes. Additionally, human exposure to 1-NP concentrations exceeding 100 ppm reportedly causes eye irritation in humans. ANIMAL STUDIES: Exposures at 5,000 ppm of 1-NP for 3 hr killed rabbits and guinea pigs. However, concentration of 10,000 ppm for 1 hr was not lethal. Signs of 1-NP exposure included conjunctival irritation, lacrimation, slow respiration with some rales, incoordination, ataxia, and weakness. Rats treated with 1-NP at 1 mmol/kg bw three times per week for 16 weeks had only slightly reduced body weight, and after 26 weeks (termination of treatment), they regained their body weight. One benign liver tumor was observed in these rats. Hepatotoxic symptoms were also observed. There have been numerous studies on the mutagenic activity of 1-NP in Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test). 1-NP was not mutagenic in multiple strains of S. typhimurium with or without the addition of various microsomal metabolic activating systems. The effects of DNA repair synthesis were also studied in numerous mammalian cell lines derived from humans, mice, hamsters, and rats, but 1-NP was not active. An additional study examined liver cell lines that possess cytochrome P450 metabolic capability versus V79 cells that lack this capability. 1-NP was completely inactive in the liver cell lines but did induce mutations and micronuclei in V79 cells.",

Two additional groups (5/sex/group) received the vehicle alone or 100 mg/kg/day of 1-nitropropane and were maintained for observation an additional 14 days post-treatment. One mortality was reported among the high-dose males on day 27, after developing severe clinical signs of hunched posture, lethargy, and ataxis. Animals receiving 100 mg/kg/day were seen to have increased salivation with red/brown staining around the mouth after treatment on day 15, and two females from this group developed a hunched posture on day 28 (prior to final dosing). Decreased bodyweight gain and food intake were noted for high-dose males, but these parameters were comparable to controls in females from this group and animals from other treatment groups. Necropsy performed on the early mortality revealed dark kidneys, thickening of the forestomach, and sloughing of the glandular epithelium. The organ weight data revealed that 100 mg/kg animals had statistically significant increases in absolute and relative brain weights with no corresponding microscopic changes. No effects were seen in animals from the 10 or 30 mg/kg groups, nor from the additional 100 mg/kg/day group, held for observation and recovery. The NOEL for the conditions of this study was determined to be 30 mg/kg/day.",

The test material was applied as a solution (15.28 mg (14)C-1-nitropropane in 300 uL alcohol) then covered with an occlusive patch. The patch was removed after 12 hours and the skin was wiped with soap/acetone swabs. Swabs and patches were extracted with acetone and alcohol, then the swabs combusted to (14)CO2 and water. Both the extracts and combustion products were assayed for radioactivity. Blood samples, urine, and feces were collected at various time intervals for 72 hours following treatment, while the test site and 2 small areas of adjacent untreated skin (approximately 1.13 sq cm) were excised after 72 hours and examined histologically. All samples were analyzed for radioactivity. The 2 monkeys (PH0140 and PH0142) showed no signs of toxicity, and food and water consumption were normal. Within 72 hours, 0.204% and 0.405% (PH0140 and PH0142, respectively) of the applied dose was recovered from urine and feces, with an average of 94.8% of that for both animals being excreted in the urine. The skin from the application sites as well as adjacent skin samples contained 0.043% and 0.102% of the total dose. The swabs and patches accounted for 0.115% and 0.064% of the total dose while negligible amounts of radioactivity were detected in blood samples from either monkey. It was reported that 99.583% and 99.389% (PH0140 and PH0142, respectively) of the dose remained unrecovered due to the high volatility of the test material as well as the carrier.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 10.1 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-nitropropane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-nitropropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 37 days. 1-Nitropropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-nitropropane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 37. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.70X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. The pKa of 1-nitropropane is 8.98, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. 1-Nitropropane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using the Closed Bottle test, 45% degradation in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 1-nitropropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 hours and 7 days, respectively. A BCF of 1.3 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1-nitropropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-nitropropane is produced or used. The general population is exposed to 1-nitropropane via inhalation from smoking cigarettes. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 1-nitropropane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 37 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.40X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). 1-Nitropropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

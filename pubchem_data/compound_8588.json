When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The rats were then observed for an additional 26-29 wk, and mice for an additional 16-17 wk. Controls consisted of groups of 50 untreated rats of each sex and 50 untreated mice of each sex; separate controls were used for the groups of animals administered the different doses. All surviving rats were /sacrificed/ at 104-110 wk; all surviving mice were /sacrificed/ at 94-97 wk. ...

Other tumors induced in the rats were carcinomas or papillomas of the integumentary system in males, carcinomas of the Zymbal's gland of the ear in males and females, and adenocarcinomas of the uterus.

It sets up criteria for the classification of chemicals for physical-chemical, health, and environmental hazards of chemical substances and mixtures and sets up standardized hazard information to facilitate global trade of chemicals.  Please note that obsolete codes are added in this classification for completeness purposes, as they are still in use. Any obsolete codes are annotated as such.",

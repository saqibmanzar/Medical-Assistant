PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Formation and distribution of DNA adducts after chronic administration of fluoranthene in the diet was also studied. Fluoranthene-derived radioactivity was widely distributed throughout the animal after a single dose, and excreta contained the greatest amounts of radioactivity at all dose levels. Fluoranthene binding to globin was proportional to dose over the range of 2 nmol/kg to 177 umol/kg, and the adducted protein was cleared at the same rate as unmodified hemoglobin, indicating that the adducts are stable in vivo. In contrast, fluoranthene-DNA adducts were not present at detectable levels in liver or kidney 24 hr after one dose; low levels of adducts were found only in the lung at the highest dose level. Chronic administration of fluoranthene in the diet, however, resulted in DNA adduct formation in most tissues examined, including liver, kidney, lung, small intestine, heart, spleen and lymphocytes; adducts were not detectable in testes DNA. The major fluoranthene-DNA adduct found in rat tissues was identified by its chromatographic similarity to the major fluoranthene adduct formed in vitro using microsomally-activated fluoranthene and calf thymus DNA, previously identified as a reaction product of anti-2,3-dihydroxy-1,10b-epoxy-1,2,3-trihydro-fluoranthene with N2-deoxyguanosine. The unusual stability of this diol epoxide at physiological pH may allow transport of this ultimate DNA-binding metabolite to virtually all tissues. These results demonstrate the applicability of the HPLC-(32)P-postlabelling procedure to detect and quantify fluoranthene-DNA adducts formed in vivo, and suggest that analysis of these adducts in accessible tissues such as lymphocytes may be a means of assessing chronic, high level exposure to fluoranthene. Our results also indicate that hemoglobin adducts of fluoranthene could be useful dosimeters for detecting short-term or chronic exposure to this compound if a suitable method for their detection were developed.",

Concentrations of phenanthrene (Phe), anthracene (Ant) and benz[a]anthracene (BaA) were significantly higher in maternal blood of the DE group than those of the control group. Concentration of Phe in fetuses of the DE group was significantly higher than those of the control group. Concentrations of fluorene, Ant, fluoranthene (Flu), pyrene (Pyr), BaA and chrysene (Chr) tended to be higher in fetuses of the DE group. The levels of Ant, Flu, Pyr and Chr in breast milk from the DE group were significantly higher than those of the control group. These results indicate that PAHs taken into mother rat by the inhalation of DE are transferred into fetuses via placenta and into breast milk. ...",

C. elegans metabolized FA to trans-2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrofluoranthene (trans-2,3-dihydrodiol), 8- and 9-hydroxyfluoranthene trans-2,3-dihydrodiol, 3-fluoranthene-beta-glucopyranoside, and 3-(8-hydroxyfluoranthene)-beta-glucopyranoside. These metabolites were separated by thin-layer and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, UV, and mass spectral techniques. The major pathway involved hydroxylation to form a glucoside conjugate of 3-hydroxyfluoranthene and a glucoside conjugate of 3,8-dihydroxyfluoranthene which together accounted for 52% of the total ethyl acetate-soluble metabolites. C. elegans initially metabolized FA in the 2,3 position to form fluoranthene trans-2,3-dihydrodiol, which has previously been shown to be a biologically active compound in mammalian and bacterial genotoxicity tests. However, C. elegans formed predominantly glucoside conjugates of the phenolic derivatives of FA, which suggests that this fungus has the potential to detoxify FA.",

This leads to a larger intake and retention of lipophilic toxic chemicals in the body with an increase in risks to human health. The objective of this study was to characterize the effect of dietary fat on disposition and metabolism of fluoranthene (FLA), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compound. FLA was administered to F-344 rats in monounsaturated (peanut oil), polyunsaturated (corn oil) and saturated (coconut oil) fats at doses of 50 and 100 ug/kg via oral gavage. Blood, small intestine, liver, lung, testis, adipose tissue, urine and feces were collected at various time points' post-FLA exposure. Samples were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for FLA parent compound and metabolites. DNA was isolated from the tissues and subjected to (32)P-post labeling to measure FLA-DNA adducts. The concentrations of unchanged FLA (FLA parent compound) and its metabolites showed an increase for the saturated fat treatment group compared with mono- and polyunsaturated fat groups. The FLA-DNA adduct concentrations were high in tissues of rats that received FLA through saturated fat. The toxicokinetic parameters, concentrations of FLA metabolites and FLA-DNA adduct showed a dose-dependent increase, and this increase was statistically significant (P<.05) for saturated fat. These findings clearly demonstrate that the high residence time of FLA parent compound in saturated fat allows extensive metabolism, contributing reactive metabolites of FLA that bind with DNA and causing marked damage in a long-term exposure scenario.",

PAHs usually occur naturally, but they can be manufactured as individual compounds for research purposes; however, not as the mixtures found in combustion products. ... Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar.

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, dermal contact), exposure to this pale yellow, crystalline substance may occur from its presence in coal tar products used in coatings for pipes and storage tanks, in roofing materials, and asphalt. Effects from exposure (based on analogy to phenol) may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, nausea, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, liver injury, pulmonary edema, and respiratory arrest. In addition, NIOSH recommends that fluoranthene be regulated as an occupational carcinogen. In activities and situations where over-exposure via coal tar products may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus, amd personal protective clothing to prevent skin contact. All such equipment and clothing should be removed in change rooms at the end of the workday, and maintained in a clean condition. Alsom workers should wash thoroughly at the end of the workday. While fluoranthene's fire hazard is only slight when exposed to heat and flame, it may be decomposed by heat, emitting acrid smoke and fumes. Spills of hot coal tar products may be covered with sand. Fluoranthene is a good candidate for disposal by rotary kiln or fluidized bed forms of incineration. Before implementing land disposal of fluoranthene, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Fluoranthene was mutagenic to cultured human Iymphoblastoid cells in the presence of an exogenous metabolic system. It is confirmed human carcinogen. ANIMAL STUDIES: A 24 week lung adenoma bioassay using newborn mice was employed to determine the tumorigenicity of fluoranthene. A 6.5-fold elevation of lung tumor incidence (58%) and a 12-fold increase in numbers (1.08 tumors/mouse) was observed in animals treated with the highest dose (3.5 mg/mouse), but no increase in tumor incidence was induced by 700 micrograms/mouse. In other experiment, fluoranthene induced lung and liver tumors 6-9 months after intraperitoneal injection of 0.7, 1.75 and 3.5 mg into preweanling mice. Although fluoranthene is mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian in vitro cell systems following metabolic activation, information on in vivo mutagenicity is lacking and studies on tumor initiating activity in mice are equivocal. Fluoranthene can produce behavioral toxicity in rats. Fluoranthene could also compromise B lymphopoiesis. A developmental study was performed in which fluoranthene was administered once via intraperitoneal injection to pregnant C57/B6 mice on gestational day 6, 7, 8 or 9. An increased rate of embryo resorption was observed. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: The acute and chronic toxicity of fluoranthene was determined for a diverse group of freshwater and saltwater species under both standard laboratory fluorescent light and ultraviolet (UV) light test conditions. Acute tests with 21 species demonstrated that fluoranthene was not lethal within its water solubility limit to most species tested under fluorescent light, but was lethal well below this limit to nearly all of the species tested under UV light. Overall, UV light increased acute fluoranthene toxicity approximately one to three orders of magnitude.",

While some PAHs are potent by nature, others undergo interactions such as additivity, synergism, antagonism or potentiation to manifest their toxicity. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether exposure to benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a PAH compound influences the cytotoxicity and metabolism of fluoranthene (FLA; another PAH compound) using HT-29 cells. Cells cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium were treated with 1, 5, 10, 25 uM BaP and FLA (0.01% dimethylsulfoxide as vehicle) individually and in combination over the course of 0-96h. At the end of exposure, cells were stained with propidium iodide and the changes in cell cycle were analyzed using FACS analysis. Apoptosis was determined by caspase-3 assay. Post-incubation, samples were extracted and analyzed for FLA metabolites by reverse-phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. Cells exposed to BaP+FLA showed a marginal decrease in growth as compared to FLA alone and vehicle controls. Also, a decline in the percentage of cells in the S and G2 phases compared to G1 phase of cell cycle was noted when cells were treated with BaP and FLA together, compared to individual FLA treatment. The rate of FLA metabolism was more when cells were exposed to FLA in combination with BaP, compared to FLA alone. The enhanced biotransformation of FLA as a result of concomitant exposure to BaP may have implications for colon cancer risks arising from human dietary exposure to PAH mixtures through consumption of barbecued meat.",

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) mediates the toxicity of some PAHs. Exposure to a simple PAH mixture during embryo development consisting of an AHR agonist (benzo(a)pyrene-BaP) with fluoranthene (FL), an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 1(CYP1)--a gene induced by AHR activation--results in cardiac deformities. Exposure to BaP or FL alone at similar concentrations alters heart rates, but does not induce morphological deformities. Furthermore, AHR2 knockdown prevents the toxicity of BaP+FL mixture. Here, we used a zebrafish microarray analysis to identify heart-specific transcriptomic changes during early development that might underlie cardiotoxicity of BaP+FL. We used AHR2 morphant embryos to determine the role of this receptor in mediating toxicity. Control and knockdown embryos at 36 hr post-fertilization were exposed to DMSO, 100 ug/L BaP, 500 ug/L FL, or 100 ug/L BaP+500 ug/L FL, and heart tissues for RNA were extracted at 2, 6, 12, and 18 hr-post-exposure (hpe), prior to the appearance of cardiac deformities. Data show AHR2-dependent BaP+FL effects on expression of genes involved in protein biosynthesis and neuronal development in addition to signaling molecules and their associated molecular pathways. Ca(2+)-cycling and muscle contraction genes were the most significantly differentially expressed category of transcripts when comparing BaP+FL-treated AHR2 morphant and control embryos. These differences were most prominent at 2 and 6 hpe. Therefore, we postulate that BaP+FL may affect cellular Ca(2+) levels and subsequently cardiac muscle function, potentially underlying BaP+FL cardiotoxicity.",

In the presence of fluoranthene the level of B[a]]P-DNA binding was increased at each of the time intervals examined (4, 8, 24 and 48 hr) with enhancements ranging from 76% at 4 hr to 36% at 48 hr. The ratio of anti-7,8,-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (anti-BPDE)-DNA adducts/syn-BPDE-DNA adducts was also increased in the presence of fluoranthene. This increase was greatest at 8 hr (44%) but by 48 h the ratio was identical in the presence and absence of fluoranthene. The observed increase in anti-BPDE-DNA adducts/syn-BPDE-DNA adducts did not parallel increases in B[a]P-DNA binding suggesting that alteration of the anti-BPDE/syn-BPDE ratio is not a major contributing factor to the cocarcinogenic activity of fluoranthene. The influence of fluoranthene on the metabolism of B[a]P in vivo in mouse skin was also investigated. Fluoranthene was found to have little or no effect on the formation of ethyl acetate extractable metabolites of B[a]P in mouse skin. Specifically, there was no increase in the amount of B[a]P-7,8-diol in the presence of fluoranthene. Fluoranthene also had little or no effect on the levels of beta-glucuronide or sulfate conjugates of B[a]P metabolites formed in vivo in mouse skin. These studies suggest that the effect of fluoranthene is being expressed at some point after B[a]P has been activated to an ultimate carcinogen.",

Strong AHR agonists, such as certain polychlorinated biphenyls and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), cause severe cardiac teratogenesis in fish embryos. Moderately strong AHR agonists, such as benzo[a]pyrene and beta-naphthoflavone, have been shown to cause similar cardiotoxic effects when coupled with a cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) inhibitor, such as fluoranthene (FL). We sought to determine if weak AHR agonists, when combined with a CYP1A inhibitor (FL) or CYP1A morpholino gene knockdown, are capable of causing cardiac deformities similar to moderately strong AHR agonists. The weak AHR agonists included the following: carbaryl, phenanthrene, 2-methylindole, 3-methylindole, indigo, and indirubin. Danio rerio (zebrafish) embryos were first exposed to weak AHR agonists at equimolar concentrations. The agonists were assessed for their relative potency as inducers of CYP1 enzyme activity, measured by the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay, and cardiac deformities. Carbaryl, 2-methylindole, and 3-methylindole induced the highest CYP1A activity in zebrafish. Experiments were then conducted to determine the individual cardiotoxicity of each compound. Next, zebrafish were coexposed to each agonist (at concentrations below those determined to be cardiotoxic) and FL in combination to assess if CYP1A inhibition could induce cardiac deformities. Carbaryl, 2-methylindole, 3-methylindole, and phenanthrene significantly increased pericardial edema relative to controls when combined with FL. To further evaluate the interaction of the weak AHR agonists and CYP1A inhibition, a morpholino was used to knockdown CYP1A expression, and embryos were then exposed to each agonist individually. In embryos exposed to 2-methylindole, CYP1A knockdown caused a similar level of pericardial edema to that caused by exposure to 2-methylindole and FL. The results showed a complex pattern of cardiotoxic response to weak agonist inhibitor exposure and morpholino-knockdown. However, CYP1A knockdown in phenanthrene and 3-methylindole only moderately increased pericardial edema relative to coexposure to FL. AHR2 expression was also knocked down using a morpholino to determine its role in mediating the observed cardiac teratogenesis. Knockdown of AHR2 did not rescue the pericardial edema as previously observed with strong AHR agonists. While some of the cardiotoxicity observed may be attributed to the combination of weak AHR agonism and CYP1A inhibition, other weak AHR agonists appear to be causing cardiotoxicity through an AHR2-independent mechanism. The data show that CYP1A is protective of the cardiac toxicity associated with weak AHR agonists and that knockdown can generate pericardial edema, but these findings are also suggestive of differing mechanisms of cardiac toxicity among known AHR agonists.",

They are reported to alter trophoblast proliferation in placenta, in addition to disturbing its endocrine functions, which may be able to increase the risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women. The present study was planned to assess possible involvement of PAHs exposure of pregnant women (measured as placental PAHs concentrations) with preterm delivery cases among women of Lucknow city (India). We performed a case-control study and a total of 60 mothers (n=31 full term and n=29 preterm deliveries) were recruited at a local nursing home of Lucknow, for the period of August 2005-February 2006. Subsequent to parturition, placental tissues from each participant were immediately collected and kept at -20 degrees C until PAHs analyses. Placental tissue PAHs concentrations were determined by HPLC, using a fluorescence detector. Mean+/-SD placental level (61.91+/-12.43 ppb) of benzo(b)fluoranthene, a carcinogenic PAH, was found significantly elevated (p<0.05) among women with preterm delivery when compared with the level (23.84+/-7.01) in women having full-term deliveries. In the same way, non-carcinogenic fluoranthene level (325.91+/-45.14 ppb) was also detected to be higher in the preterm delivery group compared to 208.6+/-21.93 ppb level from the full-term delivery group of women. Additionally naphthalene, acenaphthylene, phenanthrene, anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene levels in placental tissue were also found to be higher in the preterm delivery group of women but the difference did not reach statistically significant levels. This foremost study from India with modest samples size and limited statistical power does not show a substantial involvement of PAHs with preterm delivery, but higher concentrations of placental PAHs detected among preterm delivery group of women could show some possible association with these environmental toxicants. Further study with large sample size, controlled for confounders and great statistical power, is reasonable to elucidate the association of PAHs exposure with preterm delivery of women in India.",

In the present study, fluorescein diacetate uptake and the Comet assay were used to assess the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of fluoranthene in HaCaT (human adult low calcium high temperature) cells in the presence or absence of ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation. Exposure of cells to 0.1, 0.25, 0.75, 2, and 5 uM fluoranthene alone for 30 min or to 6.1 +/- 0.07 J/sq cm UVA alone did not cause cytotoxicity or cellular DNA damage. However, concomitant exposure to both caused a nonlinear dose-response in cytotoxicity to HaCat cells. The same exposure conditions also resulted in a dose-responsive DNA damage in HaCaT cells. Because DNA damage mainly was detected at relatively high levels of cytotoxicity, we cannot rule out the possibility that it occurred as a consequence of cellular toxicity mechanisms.",

Several methylated fluoranthenes, although less prevalent than FA, have also been detected as environmental pollutants. While FA is inactive as a tumorigenic agent on mouse skin, it does induce lung and liver tumors in newborn mice. Among the five isomers of methylfluoranthene, only 2-methylfluoranthene (2-MeFA) and 3-methylfluoranthene (3-MeFA) are active as tumor initiators on mouse skin. A comparative bioassay was performed to determine the relative tumorigenic activity of FA, 2-MeFA and 3-MeFA in newborn CD-1 mice. All three compounds were assayed at doses of 3.46 and 17.3 mumol. The bioassay was terminated when mice were 1 year old. At a dose of 17.3 mumol, FA and 2-MeFA induced a similar incidence of lung tumors (65-96%) in both male and female mice. However, tumor multiplicity in the lung was different between FA and 2-MeFA. At a dose of 17.3 mumol, the multiplicity of lung tumors observed for mice administered 2-MeFA ranged from 3.04 to 3.94 tumors per mouse. In contrast, animals treated with FA developed only an average of 1.12-2.45 tumors per mouse. 3-MeFA did not induce a statistically significant incidence of lung tumors in either male or female mice. All three compounds when administered to newborn mice did induce a significant incidence of liver tumors among male mice. The relative tumorigenic potency observed was FA > or = 2-MeFa >> 3-MeFA. Only 2-MeFA at a dose of 17.3 mumol was tumorigenic in the liver of female mice. These bioassay results are contrasted with prior studies on the in vitro genotoxic activity and metabolic activation pathways of FA, 2-MeFA and 3-MeFA.",

Small branches were incubated in different concentrations of fluoranthene followed by exposure to ecologically relevant levels of natural solar radiation, with and without UVR. Exposure to the highest concentration of fluoranthene (60 ug/L) resulted in decreased photochemical efficiency of corals exposed concomitantly to UVR but not in corals exposed to 60 ug/L fluoranthene without UVR. After 6 days, most coral samples that were exposed to fluoranthene and UVR bleached or died (78%) on the upper side of the branches. At 60 ug/L fluoranthene with UVR, 11 out of 12 samples died and the remaining sample bleached, much greater than the number of samples that bleached in manipulation or solvent controls. On the under side of the same samples, where the coral polyps are naturally protected from UVR, 11 out of 12 samples remained healthy and intact. The high UVR doses that shallow water dwelling corals receive combined with the results of this study show that photoinduced toxicity of PAHs is a stress factor that needs to be studied in more detail in coral reef ecosystems.",

Exposure to fluoranthene and simulated solar ultraviolet radiation for 48 hr caused a significant effect on locomotor behavior at 60 ug fluoranthene. At 96 hr, however, hyperactivity was noted in the 40-ug fluoranthene/L exposure. The skin of bullfrog larvae was sensitive to the phototoxic effects of fluoranthene. Following exposure to sublethal levels of fluoranthene (10 ug fluoranthene/L) there were signs of necrosis as well as structural alterations in the skin when examined using light microscopy. Based on these results, the photoinduced toxicity of fluoranthene, and hence other phototoxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pose a potential hazard to ranid larvae well within the water solubility limits of the compound.",

Embryos were exposed in a laboratory setting from an early developmental stage through hatching under artificial UV light, and newly hatched larvae were exposed outdoors in varying sunlight intensity levels. Outdoor exposures indicated greater sensitivity in the toxic response than did laboratory exposures. In the laboratory, mortality and malformation of X. laevis were the most sensitive indicators of exposure. Xenopus laevis was also the most sensitive species tested to the effects of UV light alone. Hatching success of R. pipiens was monitored outdoors and was not a useful predictive endpoint in the determination of photoinduced toxicity; however, newly hatched larvae were sensitive to the effects of photoinduced toxicity. Amybstoma maculatum and X. laevis larvae were affected by low (ug/L) concentrations of fluoranthene in sunlight. These findings suggest that low levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons could be acting synergistically with environmental factors such as UV light to place young amphibians at risk.",

In this study we examined the genotoxicity of Flu to Capitella sp. I using the comet assay. ... Patterns of DNA damage /were assessed/ as a function of uptake route and as a function of exposure and depuration time and related levels of DNA damage to published information on Flu-metabolite formation. Exposure to approximately 30 ug Flu/g dry-weight sediment or 50 ug Flu/L seawater resulted in significant DNA damage. The degree of DNA damage was time dependent during both exposure and depuration, and although exposure route had no effect on the maximum degree of DNA damage occurring, it did influence the time course of damage. Levels of damage declined despite continued exposure to Flu, providing evidence for the induction of one or more DNA repair mechanisms. Comparison with Flu-metabolite profiles suggests that DNA damage is associated with the production of aqueous metabolites. The transitory nature of the DNA damage and repair process may contribute important insights into the mechanisms of toxicant effects at the molecular level but limits the usefulness of such endpoints as biomarkers of exposure or effect in ecotoxicological studies.",

                                                    "String": "Fluoranthene occurs in fossil fuels. Its release to the environment is wide spread since it is a ubiquitous product of incomplete combustion. It is released to the atmosphere in emissions from the combustion of oil, gasoline, coal, wood and refuse. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.22X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates fluoranthene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase fluoranthene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hours. Particulate-phase fluoranthene will be physically removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Fluoranthene absorbs UV light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. However, particulate phase fluoranthrene can be stable to photo-oxidation which will permit its long range global transport. Fluoranthene is found both in the free and adsorbed state in both the aqueous and atmospheric compartments and photodegradation is usually different in the sorbed state. If released to soil, fluoranthene is expected to have no mobility based upon a Koc range of 29,500-295,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.45X10-6 atm-cu m/mole; however, adsorption is expected to attenuate this process. Fluoranthene is not expected volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The degradation half-life for fluoranthene applied to Kidman sandy loam and McLaurin sandy loam was determined to be 377 days and 268 days, respectively, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, fluoranthene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based on the Koc. In shake flask studies, an initial fluoranthene concentration of 16.2 ug/mL was reduced to 7.6 ug/mL following 2 weeks incubation in contaminated groundwater from a US Superfund site, indicating that biodegradation may be a gradual environmental fate process under certain condition. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based on its Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 and 46 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond was 17 years when adsorption was considered. Measured BCF values of 380-6,110 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. The estimated photolysis half-life in sunlit surface waters was 21 hours. Occupational exposure to fluoranthene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where fluoranthene is generated. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to fluoranthrene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and smoking tobacco products. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.45X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 days and 46 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond was 17 years when adsorption was considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), BCF values of 380(7) to 6,110(8,9) suggest that the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(10). Half-lives for the direct photochemical decomposition of fluoranthene in freshwater ranged from 21.0 hours near the surface of freshwater (simulated latitude, 40 deg N, mid-day, mid-summer) to 200 hours at a depth of 5 m and partitioned to bottom sediment(11). Fluoranthene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). In shake flask studies, an initial fluoranthene concentration of 16.2 ug/mL was reduced to 7.6 ug/mL following 2 weeks incubation in contaminated groundwater from a US Superfund site(12) indicates that biodegradation may be a gradual environmental fate process under certain conditions(SRC).",

Vapor-phase fluoranthene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 8 hours(SRC) calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Particulate-phase fluoranthene may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). The atmospheric lifetime of vapor-phase fluoranthene due to reaction with nitrate radicals has been calculated as approximately 85 days(4). Fluoranthene absorbs UV light at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). The photolytic half-life of fluoranthene adsorbed to silica, alumina, fly ash, and carbon black substrates were measured as 74, 23, 44, and >1,000 hours, respectively, following irradiation with a 400 watt mercury lamp(6). Fluoranthene is found both in the free and adsorbed state in both the aqueous and atmospheric compartments and photodegradation is usually different in the sorbed state(7).",

In a pilot wastewater treatment plant, no fluoranthene was lost due to biodegradation(3). The presence of the anionic surfactant SDS was found to enhance the biodegradation of fluoranthene(4). Mixed results were reported in a static biodegradability test employing a domestic wastewater inoculum where 100% and 0% of the fluoranthene was degraded in four successive weekly subcultures at concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/L, respectively(5).

Microbial degradation was more rapid in upper surfaces than in lower layers of sediment and greatest where the sediment grain size was largest(2). When percolated through a soil column in a mixture of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), fluoranthene degraded with a half-life of 44 days(1,3). When 7 applications of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon-containing oily sludge was amended to soil over a two year period and then monitored for an additional year and a half, the fluoranthene residue in the soil at the end of the 2 year ammendation period was decreased by 39% in the following year and a half(6). In the sludge ammendation experiment, 4.7% of the applied fluoranthene remained after 3 1/2 years(4).",

The half-life of fluoranthene in Kidman sandy loam soil was determined to be 26 days (oil refinery waste on soil), 440 days (synthetic mixture on soil), 74 days (1% creosote on soil), and 377 days (single constituents)(2). The half-life of fluoranthene in a wood preserving sludge soil was determined to be 91 days, from an initial concentration of 1200 mg/kg and a final concentration of 30 mg/kg after 287 days(3). The half-life of fluoranthene in a sludge-amended soil and in a spiked soil was reported to be 110 and 16 days, respectively(4). The degradation half-life for fluoranthene applied to Kidman sandy loam and McLaurin sandy loam was determined to be 377 days and 268 days, respectively(5). A study in which polyaromatic hydrocarbon contaminated sludge was applied to 4 soil samples collected in Lancaster, England resulted in biodegradation half-lives of 110, 184, 143, and 110 days for fluoranthene(6). A long term field study of the application of sewage sludge to soil at Luddington and Lee Valley, UK, resulted in average biodegradation half-lives of 7.8 and 3.1 years, respectively, for fluoranthene(7).",

Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons also photodecompose in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone, other oxidants, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides while singlet oxygen is considered to be the major oxidant species in water(2). Fluoranthene is found both in the free and adsorbed state in both the aqueous and atmospheric compartments and photodegradation is usually different in the sorbed state. No significant degradation was observed when fluoranthene vapor adsorbed on coal fly ash from the electrostatic precipitator of a power plant was irradiated for 3.3 hr using a xexon lamp(3). When filters containing pure fluoranthene were exposed to air and synthetic smog (1 hr exposure equivalent of 100 hr exposure to natural smog), 20 and 24% of the cmpd decomposed in air in 48 hr in darkness or light, respectively. 59% was lost in 1 hr when exposed to smog and light(4). When filters containing fluoranthene sorbed on combustion particules were exposed, 4% of the compound was lost in 48 hrs in air and light while 59% was lost in 1 hr exposed to synthetic smog and light(4). Therefore, it would appear that sorbed fluoranthene is less reactive than the free vapor in air but equally reactive in photochemical smog(4). It should be noted that sorption on certain types of surfaces (eg silica gel) greatly enhances photodecomposition(2). When particulate matter from air was analyzed immediately and after being stored in a sealed envelope, it was found that 37% and 92% of the fluoranthene was lost in storage after 3 wks and 1 yr, respectively(2).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

In a 21 day bioconcentration test in a flow through tank, the log BCF in rainbow trout was 2.58 (BCF = 380)(2). A 28 day experiment in a flow through tank detected a log BCF of 3.60 (BCF = 3,981) after 7 days in fathead minnows; depuration occurred in 2 days(3). According to a classification scheme(4), the BCF values in sunfish, rainbow trout and fathead minnows suggest that the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(5). The BCF for fluoranthene in the clam Crassostrea virginica was 10,000 from 8 days exposure to 0.004 ppm fluoranthene via the overlying water column(6). Bioconcentration factors (ratio between tissue and sediment concentrations) of 5.7 and 12.0 were measured in Polychaete sp. and Capitella capitata(7). The BCF of fluoranthene in crayfish was determined to range between 1,520-3,510(1). A mean BCF of 76,696 was measured in the fresh-water amphipod Pontoporeia hoyi(8). When oysters were suspended in oil treated enclosures contaminated with fluoranthene dissolved in Prudhoe crude oil, the log BCF was 4.09 after 2 days exposure; after the oysters were transferred to clean water, depuration half-life was 5 days(9).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The mean concentration of fluoranthene detected in the drinking water in Ahmedabad, India was reported as 420.71 ng/L(2). Fluoranthene has been detected in Ottawa drinking water (Jan-Feb 1978) at concentrations of 0.55 and 1.9 ng/L(3). Fluoranthene was detected in finished water of 18 USA cities, was not detected in 11 cities (detection limit 0.1-0 ng/L), was detected at a concentration of 1-8.9 ng/L in 7 cities, and was detected at a concentration of 94.5 ng/L in Wheeling, WV(4). Finished water samples from Derwent, England yielded a fluoranthene concentration of 0.8 ng/L(4). Filtration, activated carbon treatment and chlorination remove considerable amounts of fluoranthene from drinking water. However distribution systems with asphalt or coal tar linings can contribute fluoranthene to the tap water. In one extreme case in Portland Oregon, the raw water had 4 ng/L and the distributed water 640 ng/L fluoranthene(4). Fluoranthene was detected in Nordic (Norway, Finalnd, Sweden) tap water at a concentration range of <0.58 to 24 ng/L(5). Fluoranthene was detected at >0.1 ug/L in finished water from 5 of 10 utilities in the Ohio River Basin(6). Fluoranthene was detected at mean concentrations of 7.2 to 112.9 ng/L in drinking water from 3 metropolitan areas of Taiwan(7).",

The open burning of rubber tires yielded 259 mg/kg chunk tire and 458 mg/kg shred tire of fluoranthene in the tire emissions(3). The concentration of fluoranthene in an effluent channel from a coking plant was determined to be 31.0 ug/g dry weight in sediment and 2.8 ug/L in the water effluent(4). Fluoranthene was detected in the wastewater effluent of two aluminum plants in Norway at concentrations of 600 ng/L and 212 ng/L(5).",

Fluoranthene was identified in tire wear particles, brake lining particles, and road dust particles at concentrations of 11.1, 0.69, and 6.9 ug/g of particle sample, respectively(2). Aerosol samples were collected systematically throughout a complete annual cycle (1982) at four urban sites in southern California. Ambient annual concentrations of fluoranthene ranged from 0.07 to 0.15 ng/cu-m(3). Fluoranthene was found in fine particulate abrasion products from green leaves at a concentration of 1.2 ug/g and from dead leaves at a concentration of 0.47 ug/g; samples collected were from trees characteristic of the Los Angeles, CA area(4). Fine particle emission rates for fluoranthene from a natural gas-fired water heater and a natural gas-fired space heater were determined. A HEPA-filtered dilution air sample emission rate for fluoranthene was determined to be 0.19 pg/kJ; the emission rate for fluoranthene through the first filter was determined to be 685.3 pg/kJ; the emission rate for fluoranthene through the backup filter was determined to be 251.7 pg/kJ(5). The concentration of fluoranthene in three engine fuels was determined to average 3.07 mg/L; the concentration of fluoranthene from particulate emission from a fuel-injected Otto engine was determined to average 2.05 ug/km(6). average emission rates of fluoranthene for diesel powered automobiles in Sweden were measured as 2.5 ug/km (particulate-phase) and 18 ug/km (vapor-phase), while the average emissions for unleaded gasoline powered automobiles were 17 ug/km (particulate-phase) and 5.6 ug/km (vapor-phase)(7). Fluoranthene was detected in diesel particulate at a concentration of 50 ug/g(8). Fluoranthene was identified in particulate matter from a spark-ignited engine and a diesel engine as having concentrations of 320 and 44 ug/g, respectively(9). It was detected in the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel at 93 ng/cu m(10).",

Sediment concentrations from two remote Adirondack, NY lakes were as follows: Sagamore (depth cm/ppb): 0-4/460, 4-8/400, 8-80/3-81; Woods: sediment 0-4/1200, 4-8/320, 8-80/11-25(7). The compound was detected in Georges Bank surface sediment (various sites and seasons) at 1-130 ppb, including pyrene(8). Fluoranthene qas reported in an unspecified industrial river in USA from below chemical plant at 1-60 ppm in sediment although it was not detected in the river water(9).",

Two hundred and thirteen sediment samples from 58 sediment cores were collected throughout the Newark Bay Estuary, New Jersey during November/December 1991, December 1992, and March 1993; fluoranthene concentrations ranged from 0.27 to 530 mg/kg(3). Fluoranthene was detected in sediment samples collected from six stations in Hamilton Harbour, Ontario, Canada between April and September 1986(4). Sediment samples (12) of various parts of Lake Lagoda, Russia collected in June 1993 were found to contain fluoranthene ranging in concentrations from 1.3 to 140 ng/g(5).

Fluoranthene concentrations in airborne particles sampled at four sites in an urban and industrialized area in the Netherlands ranged from 0.93 to 3.26(2). Fluoranthene was detected in (the particulate and vapor phases) air samples collected from Kosnica, Croatia in Feb and Aug of 1990 at mean concentrations of 150.0 and 20.6 ng/cu m, respectively(3). In a long-term air monitoring study of four urban United Kingdom areas sampled throughout 1991, the concentration of fluoranthene ranged from 12.5 to 33.5 ng/cu m(4). The average fluoranthene concentration in Birmingham, UK was 12.36 ng/cu m in the winter months and 2.11 ng/cu m during the summer months(5). Seasonal sampling at an urban site in Birmingham, England contained 12.4 ng/cu m fluoranthene in winter and 2.11 ng/cu m in summer; seasonal sampling at a rural site in South Kensington, England contained 0.41 ng/cu m fluoranthene in summer(6). Seventy samples of airborne particulates were sampled from two sites in Thessaloniki, Greece during a 1 year period starting in July 1987; the average fluoranthene concentration was determined to be 4.0 and 3.3 ng/cu m, respectively(7). Aerosol samples collected at six sites in Hong Kong during the winter months of 1993 were found to contain fluoranthene concentrations ranging from 136 to 2757 pg/cu m(8). The mean level of fluoranthene in air samples collected from Fairbanks, Alaska was 1.5 ng/cu m(9). Levels of fluoranthene ranged from 1.4 to 4.7 ng/cu m in the ambient air of Hagfors, Sweeden (10). Fluoranthene was detected in ambient air at 8 locations of the US in 2016 according to data contained in the EPA Air Quality System (AQS) database (11). The arithmetic means ranged from 0.44 to 1.86 ng/cu m at these 8 locations(11).",

A field study in which the indoor air of eight homes in Columbus, OH was monitored during the winter of 1986/1987 detected fluoranthene concentrations ranging from 3.0 to 23 ug/cu m(2). The level of fluoranthene in charcoal smoke alone and in smoke from charcoal grilling was determined to be 16 ug/kg and 25 ug/kg, respectively(3). The average concentration of fluoranthene in ten different homes in Columbus, OH ranged from 10.93 to 27.47 ng/cu m(4). The concentration of fluoranthene from open fire and unvented coal combustion in rural homes of Xuan Wei County, China, was determined to be 7.0 ug/cu m and 60.3 ug/m, respectively(5). The concentration of fluoranthene from unvented kerosene heater emissions in mobile homes was determined to be 1.6 ng/cu m with the heater off and 1.1 ng/m with the heater on(6). The level of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from smoking kilns in Danish smokehouses was determined; the max fluoranthene concentration observed in 10 smokehouses was determined to be 460 ug/cu m(7). The level of fluoranthene in the homes of Ahmedabad, India using cattle dung, cattle dung/wood, and wood as cooking fuel was determined to be 267, 317, and 63 ng/cu m, respectively(8). Indoor air samples of fluoranthene measured in Fairbanks, Alaska had a mean level of 0.7 ng/ cu m (9). Fluoranthene levels of Swedish homes that used wood heating appliances ranged from 0.5 to 6.7 ng/cu m, while levels in homes that did not use wood heating ranged from 0.44 to 3.7 ng/cu m(10).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this colorless liquid may occur from its use as a solvent, as a frothing agent in ore flotation, in lubricants, plasticizers, oils, and paints, and as a chemical intermediate for diamyldithiophosphates, 2-methyl-1-butylamine, esters, and ethers.  Effects from exposure may include irritation of the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes, headache, dizziness, giddiness, nausea, cardiac arrhythmias, or pulmonary edema. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus. If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water.  This substance must be moderately heated before ignition will occur.  If this substance should be involved in a fire, use water to cool the material to below its flash point.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Volatile emissions from poultry manure contain 2-methyl-1-butanol. The use of 2-methyl-1-butanol as a solvent can release it to the atmosphere by evaporation. If released to air, it will degrade by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of 47 hr). Physical removal from air via wet deposition is possible since it is relatively soluble in water. If released to soil or water, 2-methyl-1-butanol is expected to biodegrade. Leaching in soil is possible based upon its high water solubility; however, concurrent biodegradation should lessen the importance of leaching. Volatilization half-lives from a model environmental river (1 meter deep) and model pond have been estimated to be 61 hr and 28 days, respectively. The general population is exposed to 2-methyl-1-butanol through inhalation of aromas and ingestion of various foods, particularly fruits and fermented beverages. (SRC)",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This value of Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from environmental waters is slow, but may be significant from shallow rivers(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep flowing 1 m/sec with a wind velocity of 3 m/sec) can be estimated to be about 61 hr(2,SRC). Volatilization half-life from an model environmental pond can be estimated to be about 28 days(3,SRC).",

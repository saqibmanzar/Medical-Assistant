When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The M2 protein of influenza A functions as an ion channel and is important in at least 2 aspects of virus replication, disassembly of the infecting virus particle and regulation of the ionic environment of the transport pathway. By interfering with the ion channel function of the M2 protein, rimantadine inhibits 2 stages in the replicative cycle of influenza A. Early in the virus reproductive cycle, rimantadine inhibits uncoating of the virus particle, presumably by inhibiting the acid-mediated dissociation of the virion nucleic acid and proteins, which prevents nuclear transport of viral genome material. Rimantadine also prevents viral maturation in some strains of influenza A (e.g., H7 strains) by promoting pH-induced conformational changes in influenza A hemagglutinin during its intracellular transport late in the replicative cycle. Adsorption of the virus to and penetration into cells do not appear to be affected by rimantadine. In addition, rimantadine does not interfere with the synthesis of viral components (e.g., RNA-directed RNA polymerase activity).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

MPB (3 x 10 mg/kg on the first day) reduced the plasma bilirubin level in mature newborns on day four by 33% in comparison to those on placebo. The results justify further investigations in premature babies, who frequently suffer from disturbances which may facilitate the development of bilirubin encephalopathy.",

The total daily amt of phenobarbital then is administered as a single dose or in 3 or 4 divided doses, not to exceed 600 mg/day. If signs of withdrawal occur on the first day of treatment, a loading dose of 100 to 200 mg of phenobarbital may be administered intramuscularly in addition to the oral dose. After stabilization on phenobarbital, the total daily dose is decreased by 30 mg/day as long as withdrawal is proceeding smoothly. This regimen may be modified by initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage level and decreasing the daily dosage by 10% if tolerated by the patient. 3) For infants physically dependent on barbiturates, initially a dose of 3 to 10 mg of phenobarbital/kg bw/day may be given. After withdrawal symptoms (hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, tremors, hyperreflexia) are relieved, the dosage of phenobarbital should be gradually decreased and completely withdrawn over a 2-wk period. 4) Also, barbiturate withdrawal may be accomplished with benzodiazepines, such as diazepam. /Barbiturates/",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

There appears to be very little difference in duration of hypnotic action among barbiturates used orally as hypnotics. Therefore, most authorities now believe that barbiturates should be classified according to their intended pharmacologic action (ie, sedative-hypnotic barbiturates and anesthetic barbiturates [methohexital, thiamylal (no longer commercially available in the US), thiopental]), rather than as long-acting (mephobarbital, metharbital, and phenobarbital), intermediate-acting (amobarbital and butabarbital), short-acting (aprobarbital, pentobarbital, and secobarbital), and ultrashort-acting (methohexital, thiopental). /Barbiturates General Statement/",

It has not been definitely determined whether mephobarbital contributes to the anticonvulsant effect or whether the metabolite, phenobarbital, is the only active agent during mephobarbital therapy. Phenobarbital may be excreted in the urine unchanged, as the p-hydroxyphenobarbital metabolite, or as glucuronide or sulfate conjugates. Alkalinization of the urine and/or increasing the urine flow substantially increases the rate of excretion of unchanged phenobarbital.",

All of the volunteers were phenotypically extensive metabolizers of the drug. The R- and S-enantiomers of MPB were analyzed in plasma by an enantioselective HPLC method, and the enantiomers of the 4-hydroxy-MPB metabolite in urine by a similar procedure. The (R)-MPB was extensively hydroxylated, with an average of 49.56% of that enantiomer being recovered in urine as (R)-4-hydroxy-MPB. Only 7.16% of the (S)-MPB was converted to the corresponding hydroxy metabolite. The extensive hydroxylation of (R)-MPB resulted in rapid elimination of this enantiomer, with a terminal plasma half-life of 7.52 +/- 1.70 (SD) hr. The (S)-MPB, the only recognized metabolites of which were (S)-4-hydroxy-MPB and phenobarbital (PB), was eliminated very slowly [t1/2, 69.78 +/- 14.77 (SD) hr]. The oral clearance of (R)-MPB (0.470 +/- 0.184 (SD) liters/hr/kg) was much higher than that of (S)-MPB [0.017 +/- 0.001 (SD) liters/hr/kg]. The extreme differences in metabolic fate and pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of MPB are interesting. Most of the circulating PB seemed to be derived from (S)-MPB. ...",

It has not been determined which of the various actions of barbiturates at cellular and synaptic levels are responsible for their sedative and hypnotic effects. /Barbiturates General Statement/"

There have been reports of women receiving anticonvulsants (eg, phenobarbital) who became pregnant while receiving oral contraceptives. Phenobarbital may enhance the metabolism of both the estrogenic and progestinic components of oral contraceptives, presumably by induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. Because of the risk of contraceptive failure during concomitant use of oral contraceptives and phenobarbital (or mephobarbital), it has been suggested that alternate methods of contraception be considered in patients receiving phenobarbital. /Barbiturates General Statement/",

Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly. Standard treatment for shock should be administered if necessary. Management of hypotension may include administration of iv fluids, elevation of the lower extremities, and/or use of vasopressor or inotropic agents. For seizures, iv diazepam and phenytoin may be used; in case of refractory seizures, general anesthesia and paralysis induced by a neuromuscular blocking agent may be necessary. Activated charcoal is an effective barbiturate adsorbant when administered within 30 minutes following ingestion of the drugs. Gastric lavage or gastric aspiration is not recommended unless there is evidence that the drug has been ingested recently (within 4 hours); care should be taken to prevent pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Multiple-dose, nasogastric administration of activated charcoal has been used effectively to treat phenobarbital overdose; activated charcoal enhances elimination of the drug and shortens the duration of coma. The patient's vital signs, fluid intake, blood gases, and serum electrolytes should be monitored closely. Analeptic drugs should not be administered because they may produce paroxysmal cerebral activity which may result in generalized seizures. In addition, it has been demonstrated that analeptics are incapable of stimulating respiration and exerting an arousal effect in patients with severe barbiturate poisoning and profound CNS depression. If renal function is normal, forced diuresis may be of benefit. In addition, alkalinization of the urine increases renal excretion of phenobarbital, aprobarbital, and mephobarbital which is metabolized to phenobarbital. Peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis may be useful in severe barbiturate intoxication and/or if the patient is anuric or in shock. /Barbiturates General Statement/",

Pupils usually are slightly constricted but may be dilated in severe poisoning. Patients with severe overdosage often experience typical shock syndrome; apnea, circulatory collapse with loss of peripheral vascular tone, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, and death may occur. Complications such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or renal failure may also prove fatal. Other complications which may occur are congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and urinary tract infections. Some patients have bullous cutaneous lesions which heal slowly. Sweat gland necrosis may also occur. /Barbiturates General Statement/"

The respective morpholonoalkylic derivatives not only did not shortened the /CNS depression/  sleep, but even slightly prolonged. it. The liver weight of the rats, treated with barbiturates, was increased with 25-30% while that of the rats treated with morpholinoalkylic derivatives did not differ from the liver weight of the control animals. The protein content in liver homogenates did not show statistically significant differences in the single groups. The protein content of the microsomal liver fraciton was increased in the animals, treated with barbiturates and glutetimide, while in the rats, treated with morphoalkylic derivatives the protein content did not differ from that of the controls, but it was even reduced after treatment with a derivative of glutetimide.

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Groups of five male MOL:WIST rats were given single ip injections, ranging from 85 to 3000 um/kg of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), 1,2,3-tribromopropane (TBP), 1,3-dichloro-2-bromopropane (DB2CP), or 1-bromo-2,3-dichloropropane (B2,3DCP), 1,3-dibromopropane, 1,2-dibromopropane, 1,2,3-trichloropropane or 1-bromo-3-chloropropane. The most potent in causing organ damage in both kidney and testes were DBCP and TBP. DB2CP was less organ toxic than DBCP or TBP, but induced more organ damage than B2,3DCP and DC2BP. The ability of the halogenated propanes to induce DNA damage in vivo correlated well with their ability to induce organ damage. However, DNA damage occurred at lower doses and after a shorter period of exposure. DNA damage may be an initial event in the development of organ necrosis by halogenated propanes in general. Testicular DNA damage induced by the halogenated propanes in vivo correlated well with the DNA damage observed in isolated testicular cells in vitro, showing that toxicity was due to in situ activation. The findings established a good relationship between in vivo organ necrogenic effects and DNA damage for a series of halogenated propanes. Both the type, the number, and the position of the halogens affected the toxic potential. The most toxic of the halogenated propanes contained three halogens with at least two vicinal bromines.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Data was collected from personnel records and death certificates. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated for comparison against rates for American white males. In all, 2,806 male workers were identified as living, 578 workers were identified as deceased. Almost half of the cohort had worked less than 6 mo. The average term of employment was 3 yr 9 mo. Overall, the standardized mortality ratio for workers was lower than that of American white males. Deaths from diabetes mellitus occurred more frequently in these workers, with rates more than twice the number expected. Overall cancer death rates were comparable among the workers and the comparison population. Stomach cancer rates were lower among workers than expected; otherwise, differences in site specific cancer deaths were not statistically significant. The workers showed lower than expected death rates for diseases of the circulatory and digestive systems and pneumonia. There was no incr trend in mortality with length of employment. /Results indicate/ that this study has identified a number of potential health problems and should be continued with a longer observation period to establish mortality trends.",

No significant overall or cause specific mortality excess was noted among those potentially exposed to either TRIS or DDT. No cancer death was noted among the rare earth employees. Mortality from diabetes mellitus was significantly elevated among the maintenance workers hired in the early 1940's. A significant mortality excess due to diseases of the circulatory system was observed among workers potentially exposed to DBCP and or rare earth process. Mortality from testicular cancer was significantly higher in those exposed to organic bromides. The common potential exposure of the testicular cancer decedents was methyl bromide.

If released to the atmosphere, 1-bromo-3-chloropropane will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on an extrapolated vapor pressure of 6.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 1-bromo-3-chloropropane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 18 days. An estimated Koc value of 63 suggests that 1-bromo-3-chloropropane will have high mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces may be significant given the vapor pressure of this compound. Based on limited data, this compound is expected to be resistant to aerobic biodegradation in soil and water; 1-bromo-3-chloropropane, inoculated with effluent from a biological waste treatment plant, reached 3% of the theoretical BOD in 5 days. In water, 1-bromo-3-chloropropane is not expected to adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its Koc value. This compound should volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 hours and 6 days, respectively. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms should be low based on an estimated BCF value of 27. The general population may be exposed to 1-bromo-3-chloropropane via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with vapors and products containing 1-bromo-3-chloropropane. Occupational exposure may be through inhalation and dermal contact at workplaces where 1-bromo-3-chloropropane is produced or used. (SRC)",

Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 hours and 6 days, respectively(1,SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 8 hours(2,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 6 days(2,SRC). 1-Bromo-3-chloropropane's values for vapor pressure, 6.4 mm Hg(3,SRC) and Henry's Law constant(1,SRC) indicate that volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).",

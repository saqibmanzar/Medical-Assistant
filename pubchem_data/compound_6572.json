PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Cyanosis (blue tint to the skin and mucous membranes) may be present following exposure to lactonitrile. Salivation, nausea, and vomiting may also occur. Tachypnea (rapid respiratory rate) may be followed by respiratory depression. Lung hemorrhage and pulmonary edema may occur. Headache, vertigo (dizziness), agitation, and giddiness may be followed by combative behavior, convulsions, paralysis, protruding eyeballs, dilated and unreactive pupils, and coma. Lactonitrile is irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. Lacrimation (tearing) and a burning sensation of the mouth and throat are common.",

Massive cyanide overdoses have survived with only good supportive care. Immediate attention should be directed toward assisted ventilation, administration of 100% oxygen, insertion of intravenous lines, and institution of cardiac monitoring. Obtain an arterial blood gas immediately and correct any severe metabolic acidosis (pH below 7.15). Oxygen (100%) should be used routinely in moderate or severely symptomatic patients even in the presence of a normal pO2, since 100% O2 increases O2 delivery, may reactivate cyanide-inhibited mitochondrial enzymes, and potentiates the effect of thiosulfate. Avoid mouth to mouth resuscitation during CPR in order to prevent self poisoning. /Cyanides/",

As a temporizing measure, the patient inhales the vapors until the sodium nitrite is ready. Because of the variability in methemoglobin production and the potential for cardiovascular collapse, this step may be omitted if sodium nitrite is readily available and the patient is not in extremis. Adequate ventilation and oxygenation are more important than administration of amyl nitrite. One perle (0.2 ml) is crushed and inhaled for 30 seconds every minute until iv nitrite is given. Sodium nitrite (3% solution), as 10 ml of a 3% solution (eg, 300 mg), is administered iv slowly over 4 minutes to produce a 20% methemoglobin level in adults. Children should receive 0.33 ml of the 3% solution per kilogram initially at an infusion rate of 2.5 ml/min, up to a maximum of 10 ml. Administer sodium nitrite doses to children on the basis of body weight, since fatal methemoglobinemia has occurred in children. /Cyanides/",

A 55 year old male employed at a chemical facility suffered dermal and respiratory exposure while attempting to repair a pump leaking propionitrile. Although he was wearing gloves, he did not have any other protective equipment. He rapidly lost consciousness and was taken to the infirmary. Upon arrival at the infirmary, he was comatose and unresponsive. He was administered oxygen at the rate of 5 l/min and transferred to the intensive care unit of a hospital. Clinical studies showed evidence of respiratory alkalosis and mild metabolic acidosis. The patient received 4 g hydroxycobalamin and 8 g sodium thiosulfate intravenously over 30 minutes. The symptoms completely cleared up over the next hr. Blood cyanide and thiocyanate concentrations were monitored. Before receiving the hydroxycobalamin and thiosulfate treatment, his blood cyanide concn was 5.71 ug/ml. The thiocyanate concn was negligible. After the cyanide/thiosulfate infusion was completed, the blood cyanide concn had decreased to 0.93 ug/ml and the thiocyanate had increased to 21.1 ug/ml. The thiocyanate concentrations returned to the baseline value 5 hr after treatment. ... Propionitrile can release cyanide and produce serious poisoning after skin or inhalation exposure. The combination of sodium thiosulfate and hydroxycobalamin is an effective antidote. /Propionitrile/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.119 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-hydroxypropanenitrile will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-hydroxypropanenitrile will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 days. A Henry's Law constant of 9.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole suggests 2-hydroxypropanenitrile is expected to volatilize from moist soil and water surfaces. However, 2-hydroxypropanenitrile reacts rapidly with water and dissociates to acetaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide and adsorption, volatilization, bioconcentration and biodegradation are not expected to be important fate processes. Occupational exposure to 2-hydroxypropanenitrile may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-hydroxypropanenitrile is produced or used. There are no data available to suggest that the general population is exposed to 2-hydroxypropanenitrile. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(SRC) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are calculated to be 3 days and 26 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of -0.94(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. However, a hydrolysis half-life of 9 minutes for the structurally related 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propanenitrile(8), suggests that 2-hydroxypropanenitrile will hydrolyze rapidly in the environment and volatilization, bioconcentration, and biodegradation will not be important fate processes(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

One screening study has demonstrated that 2-hydroxypropanenitrile was readily degraded in Ohio River water in the US(2), although this process could have been hydrolysis. Using Ohio River water as inoculum (with no special acclimation) and an aerobic test system, theoretical BODs of 50% and 70% were measured for 2-hydroxypropanenitrile after 2 and 5 day inoculation periods, respectively, at concns of 0.4-15 mg/l(2); re-dosing the system resulted in a 60% theoretical BOD(2). An activated sludge system that was acclimated to 2-hydroxypropanenitrile experienced a 87-98% BOD removal over a 4 week operation period while receiving influent 2-hydroxypropanenitrile levels that averaged 88 mg/l(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on the Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 3 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 26 days(SRC). The Henry's Law constant(1,SRC) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 2-Hydroxypropanenitrile is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.12 mm Hg(3). 2-Hydroxypropanenitrile hydrolyzes in water(4) which suggests that volatilization from moist soils and water surfaces will not be the dominant environmental fate process(SRC).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Based on the results of the acute dermal toxicity study with rats the LD50 is > 2000 mg/kg bw. From studies with rabbits no LD50 could be derived, the lowest Lethal Dose Level (LDLo) was 950 mg/kg bw. The acute oral toxicity in rats ranges from 625 to 950 mg/kg bw. 1,2-Dichloro-4- nitrobenzene causes the formation of methemoglobin. ...  1,2-Dichloro-4-nitrobenzene gave no skin irritation effects when tested for 4 hours under semiocclusive conditions ... and showed slightly irritating effects, which disappeared within 72 hours under occlusive conditions ... 1,2-Dichloro-4-nitrobenzene is slightly irritating to the eyes /but/ ...  was not found to induce dermal sensitization ... . In addition, 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene was not found to induce dermal sensitization in humans in a limited study. The main targets identified in animal studies after repeated oral administration as well as after inhalation exposure are the hematological system and in addition the kidneys after oral application and the liver after inhalation. From a 28- day oral study ...  a NOAEL of 4 mg/kg bw/day was derived. The NOAEL following subchronic inhalation exposure study of limited validity (limited documentation) was 0.4 mg/cu m (4 hours per day). Changes in hematological parameters (e.g. methemoglobinaemia, Heinz bodies) are the main target in the only available report on exposure of workers. As these findings relate to mixed exposures they cannot be clearly attributed to 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene, but would be plausible, because they were also observed in animal experiments. In the recent open literature reports of human poisoning could not be identified. 1,2-Dichloro-4-nitrobenzene exhibits mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium  but not in the HPRT test in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. 1,2-Dichloro-4-nitrobenzene induced chromosomal aberrations in V79 cells with metabolic activation only at the highest concentration, which was cytotoxic. In insects (Drosophila melanogaster) 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene revealed no mutagenic activity in the SLRL-test after application over 3 days with slight increased toxicity, but revealed mutagenic activity following a single ip injection of a clearly toxic dose. 1,2-Dichloro-4-nitrobenzene showed no clastogenic activity in vivo in a chromosomal aberrations test with rats. Overall in non-toxic doses, there was no evidence for genotoxicity in vivo under the conditions tested. Studies dealing specifically with toxicity to reproduction were not identified. The subacute study with 1,2-dichloro-4- nitrobenzene yielded no damage of the reproductive organs in rats despite clear systemic toxicity up to the maximum tolerated dose of 100 mg/kg bw. 1,2-Dichloro-4-nitrobenzene commercial grade (85% 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene and 15% 1,2-dichloro-3- nitrobenzene) caused effects on development at maternally toxic doses probably due to methemoglobinemia in dams and fetuses. A significant dose-response trend for variations (dilated ureters) was seen in the fetuses of the >= 30 mg/kg bw/day-groups and significant reduced body weight gain of dams at dose levels of 30 mg/kg bw/day on gd 6-10 with an even stronger effect at 100 mg/kg bw/day. Thus, 10 mg/kg bw/day was determined as the NOAEL for maternal and developmental toxicity. Environment: ... Concerning the acute toxicity of 1.2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene towards aquatic species reliable experimental results of tests with fish, Daphnia, and algae are available. The acute toxicity determined for fish (Leuciscus idus) was of 3.1 mg/L (48 hr LC50) ...  and Daphnia (Daphnia magna) of 3 mg/L (24 hr-EC50) ... . In the growth inhibition test with algae (Scenedesmus obliquus) the value 5.8 mg/L was achieved after 48 hr (48 hr-ErC50)... . For the algae Chlorella fusca a value of 0.32 mg/L was found after 24 hr (24 hr-ErC50). In a chronic (21 d) study with Daphnia magna a NOEC of 0.025 mg/L was determined for the most sensitive endpoint reproduction rate. An ErC10 > 0.1 mg/L was reported for the algae Scenedesmus subspicatus after 48 hours. For terrestrial organisms the lowest measured 6d-EC50 was 27 mg/L for the plant Phaseolus aureus. Applying an assessment factor of 50 to the lowest available chronic value of 25 ug/L (21d reproduction in D. magna), a PNECaqua of 0.5 ug/lL is obtained.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.03X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 320 days. 3,4-Dichloronitrobenzene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene is expected to have moderate mobility based upon Koc values of 390 to 393 using silt loams. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.07X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Lack of biodegradation of 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene incubated in an aquifer slurry over an unspecified time frame suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. However, under anaerobic conditions using a river sediment, a half-life of 2.4 days has been reported. If released into water, 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 and 51 days, respectively. Measured BCF values of 104 to 130 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene via ingestion of some seafood. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.07X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 days and 51 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF values ranging from 104 to 130(7,8) suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). Lack of biodegradation of 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene incubated in an aquifer slurry over an unspecified time frame(9) suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). However, under anaerobic conditions using a river sediment, a half-life of 2.4 days has been reported(10).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

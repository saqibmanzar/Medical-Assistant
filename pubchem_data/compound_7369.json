PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this colorless, oily liquid may occur from its manufacture and use as a catalyst, an intermediate in the production of phenols,amides, insecticides, miticides, and acaricides, and as a reagent for Friedel-Crafts sulfonation.  Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, and liver damage. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus, and chemical protective clothing which has been specifically recommended by the shipper or manufacturer. If contact should occur, immediately irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. While benzenesulfonyl chloride does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of poisonous gases.  Runoff from fire control water may cause pollution. For fires involvin g benzenesulfonyl chloride, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or regular foam.  Small spills of this substance may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. Large spills should first be diked far ahead of the spill. Benzenesulfonyl chloride is a potential candidate for liquid injection or rotary kilnforms of incineration.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If benzenesulfonyl chloride is released to soil, it will be expected to rapidly hydrolyze if the soil is moist, based upon the rapid hydrolysis observed in aqueous solution. Since it rapidly hydrolyzes, adsorption to and volatilization from moist soil are not expected to be significant processes. Based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 0.068 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C, volatilization from dry near-surface soil or other surfaces may be significant processes. If released to water, it will be expected to rapidly hydrolyze with a half-life of 5.1 min at 21 \u00b0C. Since it rapidly hydrolyzes, bioconcentration, volatilization, and adsorption to sediment and suspended solids are not expected to be significant processes. No data were located concerning biodegradation, but benzenesulfonyl chloride probably chemically hydrolyzes significantly faster than it biodegrades. Direct photolysis is not expected to be an important removal process in surface waters. If released to the atmosphere, it will be expected to exist almost entirely in the vapor phase based upon its estimated vapor pressure. It will be susceptible to photooxidation via vapor phase reaction with photochemically hydroxyl radicals. An atmospheric half-life of 7.9 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm has been estimated for this process based upon an estimated rate constant. Hydrolysis of benzenesulfonyl chloride in moist air may be an important removal process based upon its rapid hydrolysis in aqueous solution. Direct photolysis is not expected to be an important removal process in the atmosphere. Exposure to benzenesulfonyl chloride will be primarily occupational via inhalation and possibly dermal contact.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

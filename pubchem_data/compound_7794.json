When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of CT (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) inhibited (p < 0.05) the carrageenan-induced leukocyte migration to the peritoneal cavity. Additionally, the carrageenan- and arachidonic acid-induced rat hind paw edema was significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) by i.p. administration of 100 and 200 mg/kg of the compound. When the redox activity was evaluated, CT (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced hepatic lipoperoxidation (p < 0.001), as well as oxidation of plasmatic (p < 0.05) and hepatic (p < 0.01) proteins. The results of the present study support the hypothesis that CT possesses anti-inflammatory and redox protective activities. It is suggested that its effects are associated with the inhibition of the enzymes in the arachidonic acid pathway, which prevent cell migration by inhibiting leukotriene production, edema formation and the increase of reactive oxygen species in tissues.

All the six terpenoids tested, showed excellent activity and were equally effective against isolates of Candida sps., tested in this study. Linalool and citral were the most effective ones, inhibiting all the isolates at ?0.064% (v/v). Five among the six terpenoids tested were fungicidal. Time dependent kill curve assay showed that MFCs of linalool and eugenol were highly toxic to C. albicans, killing 99.9% inoculum within seven min of exposure, while that of citronellal, linalyl acetate and citral required 15min, 1h and 2h, respectively. FIC index values (Linalool - 0.140, benzyl benzoate - 0.156, eugenol - 0.265, citral - 0.281 and 0.312 for linalyl acetate and citronellal) and isobologram obtained by checker board assay showed that all the six terpenoids tested exhibit excellent synergistic activity with fluconazole against a fluconazole resistant strain of C. albicans. Terpenoids tested arrested C. albicans cells at different phases of the cell cycle i.e. linalool and LA at G1, citral and citronellal at S phase and benzyl benzoate at G2-M phase and induced apoptosis. Linalool, citral, citronellal and benzyl benzoate caused more than 50% inhibition of germ tube induction at 0.008%, while eugenol and LA required 0.032 and 0.016% (v/v) concentrations, respectively. MICs of all the terpenoids for the C. albicans growth were non toxic to HeLa cells. Terpenoids tested exhibited excellent activity against C. albicans yeast and hyphal form growth at the concentrations that are non toxic to HeLa cells. Terpenoids tested in this study may find use in antifungal chemotherapy, not only as antifungal agents but also as synergistic agents along with conventional drugs like fluconazole.",

It is used as a flavoring agent and insect repellant. It has been tested as a medication. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: A maximization test was carried out on 25 volunteers. The material was tested at a concentration of 4% in petrolatum and produced no sensitization reactions. Three cases of eczematous contact-type hypersensitivity to oils of citronella have been recorded. In two instances detailed patch-test studies were made with the ingredients of oil of citronella and some related substances. The essential allergen in oil of citronella was reported to be citronellal. ANIMAL STUDIES: Citronellal applied full strength to intact or abraded rabbit skin for 24 hr under occlusion was moderately irritating. Citronellal injected into white leghorn embryos caused dose-dependent teratogenesis. Morphological malformation occurred mainly in the craniofacial area. Citronellal produced antinociceptive effects in mice and was a strong skin sensitizer in guinea pigs. Mutagenicity was evaluated by the Salmonella/microsome assay (TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102 tester strains), without and with metabolic activation. Citronellal was not mutagenic in this test. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Citronellal inhibited embryonic development of yellow fever mosquito A aegypti eggs deposited on water. Citronellal causes a severe phytotoxicity on weeds.",

The present study investigated the effect of citronellal on inflammatory nociception induced by different stimuli and examined the involvement of the NO-cGMP-ATP-sensitive K+ channel pathway. This study used male Swiss mice (n=6 per group) that were treated intraperitoneally with citronellal(25, 50 or 100 mg/kg) 0.5 hr after the subplantar injection of 20 uL of carrageenan (CG; 30 ug/paw), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a; 100 pg/paw), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 100 ng/paw) or dopamine (DA; 30 ug/paw). The mechanical nociception was evaluated at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 hr after the injection of the agents, using a digital analgesimeter (von Frey). The effects of citronellal were also evaluated in the presence of L-NAME (30 mg/kg) or glibenclamide (5 mg/kg). At all times, citronellal in all doses inhibited the development of mechanical nociception induced by CG (p<0.001 and p<0.01) and TNF-a (p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05). The citronellal was able to increase the pain threshold in the DA test (p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05) and in the PGE2 test at all times (p<0.001 and p<0.05). L-NAME and glibenclamide reversed the antinociceptive effects of the citronellal at higher doses in the PGE2 test. These data suggest that citronellal attenuated mechanical nociception, mediated in part by the NO-cGMP-ATP-sensitive K+ channel pathway.",

Previously, we reported on the inhibitory effects of an extract and monoterpenoids (e.g., (R)-(+)-citronellal) contained in citrus herbs on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) using P-gp-overexpressed LLC-PK1 cells. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of (R)-(+)-citronellal on P-gp-mediated transport in the intestinal absorption process in vitro and in vivo. Transcellular transport of [(3)H]digoxin across Caco-2 cell monolayers was measured in the presence or absence of (R)-(+)-citronellal. (R)-(+)-citronellal reduced the basolateral-to-apical transport and efflux ratio for [(3)H]digoxin significantly. Serum concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin after intravenous and oral administration were analyzed in rats pretreated with oral (R)-(+)-citronellal. The bioavailability of digoxin after oral administration decreased significantly to 75.8% of that after intravenous administration at the same dose. (R)-(+)-citronellal increased the bioavailability of oral digoxin to 99.9% but had no effects on total body clearance, volume of distribution, or elimination rate. These findings suggest that (R)-(+)-citronellal can increase the bioavailability of oral digoxin based on the blockade of P-gp-mediated efflux of digoxin from intestinal epithelia to the lumen in the absorption process.",

In this study, the effect of various citrus-herb extracts on P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated transport was examined in vitro to investigate a possible interaction with P-gp substrates. Component monoterpenoids of the essential oil in Zanthoxyli fructus was screened to find novel P-gp inhibitors. LLC-GA5-COL150 cells transfected with human MDR1 cDNA encoding P-gp were used. Cellular accumulation of [(3)H]digoxin was measured in the presence or absence of P-gp inhibitors or test samples. Aurantii fructus, Evodiae fructus, Aurantii fructus immaturus, Aurantii nobilis pericarpium, Phellodendri cortex, and Zanthoxyli fructus were extracted with hot water (decocted) and then fractionated with ethyl acetate. The cell to medium ratio of [3H]digoxin accumulation increased significantly in the presence of the decoction of Evodiae fructus, Aurantii nobilis pericarpium, and Zanthoxyli fructus, and the ethyl acetate fraction of all citrus herbs used. The ethyl acetate fraction of Zanthoxyli fructus exhibited the strongest inhibition of P-gp among tested samples with an IC50 value of 166 ug/mL. Then its component monoterpenoids, geraniol, geranyl acetate, (R)-(+)-limonene, (R)-(+)-linalool, citronellal, (R)-(+)-citronellal, DL-citronellol, (S)-(-)-beta-citronellol, and cineole, were screened. (R)-(+)-citronellal and (S)-(-)-beta-citronellol inhibited P-gp with IC50 values of 167 uM and 504 uM, respectively. These findings suggest that Zanthoxyli fructus may interact with P-gp substrates and that some monoterpenoids with the relatively lower molecular weight of about 150 such as (R)-(+)-citronellal can be potent inhibitors of P-gp.",

We have established an in vitro approach for the detection of primary immune response. This model uses Langerhans-like dendritic cells (LLDC) derived from cord blood progenitors and autologous T lymphocytes, isolated from the same blood sample. Treatment of day 12-14 LLDC, with strong haptens trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNP), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or Bandrowski's base (BB), results in the proliferation of T lymphocytes, whereas weak allergens and irritants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) are ineffective. The use of immature (day 8) LLDC and the addition of a 48 hr stage of incubation after hapten contact, result in phenotypic maturation of LLDC in addition to lymphocyte activation in all the cultures with strong haptens. The 48 hr stage of incubation, results in sensitization and in some cases the induction of T cell proliferation to citronellal (1/8), coumarine (1/8) and to a prohapten p-phenylenediamine (pPDA; 2/8). The phenotype of DC after 48 hr of contact with a strong hapten, becomes that of mature DC (CD83(+), CD86(+) and HLA-DR(++)). With fragrance molecules, weak haptens and prohaptens, a comparable phenotype is observed only when T lymphocytes are activated. These data suggest that the unresponsiveness observed with weak haptens, may be the consequence on an incomplete maturation of LLDC.",

The ability of a range of contact allergens to induce in vitro primary sensitization of autologous T cells /has been evaluated/. T-cell proliferation induced by haptens using 2-day cultured human Langerhans cells as antigen-presenting cell was assessed by (3)H thymidine incorporation. Antigen specific stimulation was calculated as stimulation indexes. Strong allergens induced in vitro a primary T-cell response in all (trinitrophenyl, TNP: 13/13) or in the majority (fluorescein isothiocyanate, FITC: 7/10) of experiments. An irritant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), failed to generate a significant T-cell proliferation in any of the experiments (0/10). We obtained a significant lymphoproliferative response to weak sensitizers only in a limited number of experiments: (coumarin: 1/12, citronellal: 0/10, hydroxycitronellal: 2/8). p-Phenylenediamine (PPDA), a prohapten and highly sensitizing chemical in vivo, generated primary sensitization in vitro in only one of six experiments, while Bandrowski's base (BB), a metabolization product of PPDA induced a significant T-cell response in all six experiments. The present in vitro model allows discrimination between two groups of substances: strong contact sensitizers (TNP, FITC, BB) on the one hand and weak sensitizers (coumarin, citronellal and hydroxycitronellal) and irritants (SDS) on the other hand. It could be used as a screening in vitro assay to eliminate strong contact allergens before further predictive animal tests have to be performed.",

The present study investigated the effect of citronellal on inflammatory nociception induced by different stimuli and examined the involvement of the NO-cGMP-ATP-sensitive K+ channel pathway. This study used male Swiss mice (n=6 per group) that were treated intraperitoneally with citronellal(25, 50 or 100 mg/kg) 0.5 hr after the subplantar injection of 20 uL of carrageenan (CG; 30 ug/paw), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a; 100 pg/paw), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 100 ng/paw) or dopamine (DA; 30 ug/paw). The mechanical nociception was evaluated at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 hr after the injection of the agents, using a digital analgesimeter (von Frey). The effects of citronellal were also evaluated in the presence of L-NAME (30 mg/kg) or glibenclamide (5 mg/kg). At all times, citronellal in all doses inhibited the development of mechanical nociception induced by CG (p<0.001 and p<0.01) and TNF-a (p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05). The citronellal was able to increase the pain threshold in the DA test (p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05) and in the PGE2 test at all times (p<0.001 and p<0.05). L-NAME and glibenclamide reversed the antinociceptive effects of the citronellal at higher doses in the PGE2 test. These data suggest that citronellal attenuated mechanical nociception, mediated in part by the NO-cGMP-ATP-sensitive K+ channel pathway.",

Sciatic nerve recordings were made using the single sucrose gap technique in rats. The data obtained were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test for the behavioral analyses and by the Student t test for CAP evaluation. Pretreatment with CTL was effective in reducing nociceptive face-rubbing behavior in both phases of the formalin test, which was also naloxone-sensitive. CTL produced significantly antinociceptive effect at all doses in the capsaicin- and glutamate- tests. Rota-rod testing indicated that such results were unlikely to be provoked by motor abnormality. Recordings using the single sucrose gap technique revealed that CTL (10 mM) could reduce the excitability of the isolated sciatic nerve through a diminution of the compound action potential amplitude by about 42.4% from control recordings. These results suggest that CTL might represent an important tool for management and/or treatment of orofacial pain.",

However, the molecular pathways through which insects sense botanical repellents are unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila use two pathways for direct avoidance of citronellal. The olfactory coreceptor OR83b contributes to citronellal repulsion and is essential for citronellal-evoked action potentials. Mutations affecting the Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel TRPA1 result in a comparable defect in avoiding citronellal vapor. The TRPA1-dependent aversion to citronellal relies on a G protein (Gq)/phospholipase C (PLC) signaling cascade rather than direct detection of citronellal by TRPA1. Loss of TRPA1, Gq, or PLC causes an increase in the frequency of citronellal-evoked action potentials in olfactory receptor neurons. Absence of the Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (BK channel) Slowpoke results in a similar impairment in citronellal avoidance and an increase in the frequency of action potentials.",

Topically-applied eugenol, pulegone, citronellal, and alpha-terpineol produced neurotoxic symptoms, but were less toxic than malathion, dieldrin, or RH3421. Topical application of eugenol, pulegone, andcitronellal reduced spike amplitude in one of the two banks of blow fly dorsolongitudinal flight muscles within 6-8 min, but with citronellal, the amplitude of FMIs reverted to a normal pattern within 1 hr. In contrast to pulegone and citronellal, where impulse frequency remained relatively constant, eugenol caused a gradual increase, then a decline in the frequency of spikes in each muscle bank. Wing beating was blocked permanently within 6-7 min of administering pulegone or citronellal and within 16 mins with eugenol. alpha-Terpineol-treated blow flies could not beat their wings despite normal FMI patterns. The actions of these monoterpenoids on blow fly flight motor patterns are discussed and compared with those of dieldrin, malathion, RH3421, and a variety of other neuroactive substances we have previously investigated in this system. Eugenol, pulegone and citronellal readily penetrate blow fly cuticle and interfere with flight muscle and/or central nervous function. Although there were differences in the effects of these compounds, they mainly depressed flight-associated responses, and acted similarly to compounds that block sodium channels and facilitate GABA action.",

The mosquitoes surviving concentrations of geraniol, citral, eugenol, or anisaldehyde at 0.013, 0.025, 0.050, 0.100, and 0.250 ug/cu cm for 24 and 48 hr all showed different degrees of reduction in host-seeking ability. After 48 hr of exposure to 0.250 ug/cu cm geraniol, almost 100% of the mosquitoes lost their host-seeking ability. The next most potent spatial repellent, anisaldehyde, stopped host seeking by > 85.5%. Citronellal did not result in a significant reduction in the host-seeking ability at any concentration level after either 24 or 48 hr of treatment. We also found that reduction of host-seeking ability recovered after various times. The longest recovery time (144 hr) was observed for geraniol after 24 hr at 0.250 ug/cu cm. In the study, geraniol, eugenol, and citral all significantly affected the activation and orientation stages of the blood-feeding behavior. However, only anisaldehyde significantly interrupted the normal blood-feeding of mosquitoes in all stages of behavior. These initial laboratory results clearly showed that anisaldehyde and geraniol could be promising spatial repellents against A. albopictus that they could play a major role in new repellent technology.",

A significant effect on weed emergence and early seedling growth was observed in a dose-response based laboratory bioassay in a sand culture. Emergence of all test weeds was completely inhibited at 100 micro/g sand content of citronellal. Seeds of A. conyzoides and P. hysterophorus failed to emerge even at 50 microg/g content. Root length was inhibited more compared to shoot length. The failure of root growth was attributed to the effect of citronellal on the mitotic activity of growing root tips cells as ascertained by the onion root tip bioassay. At 2.5 mM treatment of citronellal, mitosis was completely suppressed and at higher concentrations cells showed various degrees of distortion and were even enucleated. The post-emergent application of citronellal also caused visible injury in the form of chlorosis and necrosis, leading to wilting and even death of test weeds. Among the test weeds, the effect was severe on C. album and P. hysterophorus. There was loss of chlorophyll pigment and reduction in cellular respiration uponcitronellal treatment indicating the impairment of photosynthetic and respiratory metabolism. Scanning electron microscopic studies in C. occidentalis leaves upon treatment of citronellal revealed disruption of cuticular wax, clogging of stomata and shrinkage of epidermal cells at many places. There was a rapid electrolyte leakage in the leaf tissue upon exposure tocitronellal during the initial few hours. In P. minor electrolyte leakage in response to 2 mM citronellal was closer to the maximum leakage that was obtained upon boiling the tissue. The rapid ion leakage is indicative of the severe effect of citronellalon the membrane structure and loss of membrane integrity. In all, the study concludes that citronellal causes a severe phytotoxicity on the weeds.",

It's use as a soap perfume and insect repellent will result in its direct release to the environment. Citronellal has been found in various tissues and essential oils of numerous plant species. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.25 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates citronellal will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase citronellal will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 hours. Citronellal contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, citronellal is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 650. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Even though the vapor pressure is low environmentally at standard temperature and pressure, there is a detectable odor; therefore, citronellal may volatilize from dry soil. Utilizing the Modified Sturm test, 83% biodegradation was achieved in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, citronellal is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 hours and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 160 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to citronellal may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where citronellal is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to citronellal via ingestion of food and inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing citronellal. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.62X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 hours and 6 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 160(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC).

Vapor-phase citronellal is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.2X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 40 minutes at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 8 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 6 days(SRC).

Even though the vapor pressure is low environmentally at standard temperature and pressure, estimated as 0.25 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3), there is a detectable odor; therefore, citronellal may volatilize from dry soil(SRC).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Pregnant rats were given CBS at a dosage of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 or 0.5 % in the diet from Day 0 to Day 20 of pregnancy. Daily intakes of CBS were 0.7 mg/kg for the 0.001% group, 7.1 mg/kg for the 0.01% group, 69.6 mg/kg for the 0.1% group and 288.8 mg/kg for the 0.5% group. Maternal body weight gain during pregnancy in the 0.1 and 0.5% groups was significantly lowered. Food consumption during pregnancy in the CBS treated groups, except for the 0.5% group, did not differ from that in the control group. Neither death nor clinical signs of toxicity were noted in the pregnant females of any group. Lowered weight in fetuses and the placentae were observed in the 0.5% group. There were no significant compound related effects on the incidence of pre- and post-implantation losses and the number and ratio of live fetuses. Morphological examinations of the fetuses revealed no evidence of teratogenesis. It could he concluded that CBS possesses no adverse effects on the prenatal development of~the offspring in rats at doses employed in the present study.",

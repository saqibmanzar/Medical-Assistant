For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this colorless, pungent-smelling liquid may occur from its use in the syntheses of chlorofluoroacetones, perfumes, antioxidants, drugs, insecticides, and vinyl compounds. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, nausea, bronchospasm, delayed pulmonary edema, and death. The ACGIH recommends a Ceiling limit of 1 ppm for this compounds. Adequate ventilation to control airborne levels is necessary. However, in activities or situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus, and full chemical protective clothing specifically recommended by the shipper or producer. If contact should occur, immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, and remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. While 1-chloro-2-propanone does not ignite easily, it may explode in the heat of a fire. Also, its thermal degradation may give rise to fumes of phosgene. Fires involving 1-chloro-2-propanone may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, standard or alcohol foam, and water spray or fog. Prolonged unstabilized storage of this substance may lead to an explosive decomposition product. 1-Chloro-2-propanone should be stored in cool, dark areas, away from sources of ignition and oxidizing materials. Small spills of 1-chloro-2-propanone may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. Large spills should be diked far ahead of the spill area to prevent 1-chloro-2-propanone from entering water sources and sewers. Before implementing land disposal of waste 1-chloro-2-propanone, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

This assay is based on changes in the melting and annealing behavior observed for damaged DNA. Exposure of calf thymus DNA to genotoxic industrial chemicals reduced the extent to which the DNA annealed as measured using a double strand DNA selective fluorescent indicator dye. Formaldehyde, acrolein, crotonaldehyde and bromoethane showed the most prominent effects, chloroacetone and allylamine exhibited lesser effects, and acrylonitrile showed no statistically significant assay response ...",

Its designation as a proposed tear gas for military and police use will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 12 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-chloro-2-propanone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-chloro-2-propanone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 44 days. 1-Chloro-2-propanone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-chloro-2-propanone is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.65X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Chloro-2-propanone may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, 1-chloro-2-propanone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 19 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 1-Chloro-2-propanone will hydrolyze, releasing hydrochloric acid which is related to its irritation as a lachrymator. Hydrolysis rate constants at 25, 30 and 37 \u00b0C are 8X10-6, 2X10-5 and 6X10-5 /hr, respectively. Occupational exposure to 1-chloro-2-propanone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-chloro-2-propanone is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-chloro-2-propanone via inhalation of ambient air and contact with products containing 1-chloro-2-propanone. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

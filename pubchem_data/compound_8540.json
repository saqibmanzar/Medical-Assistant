PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Special Hazards of Combustion Products: Can detonate or explode when heated under confinement (USCG, 1999). Aromatic nitro compounds, such as 2-CYCLOHEXYL-4,6-DINITROPHENOL, range from slight to strong oxidizing agents. If mixed with reducing agents, including hydrides, sulfides and nitrides, they may begin a vigorous reaction that culminates in a detonation. The aromatic nitro compounds may explode in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide even in the presence of water or organic solvents. The explosive tendencies of aromatic nitro compounds are increased by the presence of multiple nitro groups. Phenols do not behave as organic alcohols, as one might guess from the presence of a hydroxyl (-OH) group in their structure. Instead, they react as weak organic acids. Phenols and cresols are much weaker as acids than common carboxylic acids (phenol has pKa = 9.88). These materials are incompatible with strong reducing substances such as hydrides, nitrides, alkali metals, and sulfides. Flammable gas (H2) is often generated, and the heat of the reaction may ignite the gas. Heat is also generated by the acid-base reaction between phenols and bases.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.2X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4-dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4-dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 38 hours. Particulate-phase 2,4-dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. Nitrophenols absorb light at wavelengths greater than 290 nm, suggesting that photodegradation may be an important fate process although the kinetics of this reaction are unknown. If released to soil, 2,4-dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc value of 4,150. However, the pKa of 2,4-dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol is 4.52, which indicates that this compound will exist primarily as an anion in moist soil surfaces and anions are expected to have higher mobility in moist soils than the neutral species. Volatilization of 2,4-dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process since the anion will not volatilize and the neutral species has an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.5X10-8 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C. 2,4-Dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. If released into water, 2,4-dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc value. Volatilization of 2,4-dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon the estimated Henry's Law constant and since this compound should exist primarily as an anion in water. An estimated BCF value of 800 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Occupational exposure to 2,4-dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4-dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol is produced or used.

Volatilization of 2,4-dinitro-6-cyclohexylphenol from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) since the anion will not volatilize and the neutral species has an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.5X10-8 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) using a fragment constant estimation method(5).

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

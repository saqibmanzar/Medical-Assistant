It is a natural penicillin antibiotic that is administered intravenously or intramuscularly due to poor oral absorption.

Natural penicillins are considered the drugs of choice for several infections caused by susceptible gram positive aerobic organisms, such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, groups A, B, C and G streptococci, nonenterococcal group D streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and non-penicillinase producing staphylococcus. Aminoglycosides may be added for synergy against group B streptococcus (*S. agalactiae*), *S. viridans*, and *Enterococcus faecalis*. The natural penicillins may also be used as first or second line agents against susceptible gram positive aerobic bacilli such as *Bacillus anthracis*, *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*, and *Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae*. Natural penicillins have limited activity against gram negative organisms; however, they may be used in some cases to treat infections caused by *Neisseria meningitidis* and *Pasteurella*. They are not generally used to treat anaerobic infections. Resistance patterns, susceptibility and treatment guidelines vary across regions.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

Among the adverse reactions which had been reported in people consuming food containing benzylpenicillin residues, hypersensitivity reactions were the most common. The overall prevalence of allergy to penicillin was estimated to be 3 - 10%. There was no evidence of sensitization caused by benzylpenicillin residues in food. The Committee evaluated the available data on allergic reactions caused by penicillin residues. Only four cases were considered to be adequately documented to demonstrate that hypersensitivity reactions could be caused by ingestion of less than 40 \u00b5g of the drug. The Committee concluded that allergy was the determinating factor in the safety evaluation of residues of benzylpenicillin. In the absence of adequate data to establish a no-effect level, the Committee recommended that the daily intake from food be kept as low as practicable, and in any case below 30 \u00b5g of the parent drug. The risk associated with the occurrence of mild hypersensitivity reactions at this level was considered to be insignificant. Estimated maximum daily intake values for benzylpenicillin residues at the MRLs are 15 \u00b5g/p/d (muscle), 5 \u00b5g (liver), 3 \u00b5g/p/d (kidney), and 6 \u00b5g/p/d (milk), or 29 \u00b5g/p/d total.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

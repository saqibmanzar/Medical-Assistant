When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Using (14)C naphthalene and the fungus Cunninghamella elegans, the major free metabolites were trans-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydro-naphthalene, 4-hydroxy-l-tetralone and 1-naphthol. The sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugates of 1-naphthol were the major water soluble metabolites which were isolated by thin layer chromatography and ion pair high pressure liquid chromatography. Field Desorption Mass Spectrometry was used to identify the sulfate conjugate whereas the trimethylsilyl derivative of the glucuronic acid conjugate was characterized by Electron Impact Mass Spectrometry. Analogous metabolites were formed from biphenyl which was hydroxylated at the 4 position and then conjugated. /Naphthalene/",

Fresh shellfish tissue (< 100 g) was refluxed with 150 ml 95% ethanol for 1 hr. The solvent was separated and extracted with hexane, which was then dried and concentrated and added to a silicic acid column. The column was eluted with additional hexane to yield an alkane fraction and with 4% ether in hexane to yield a methyl-substituted fraction. The respective fractions were separated into their component hydrocarbons by gas chromatography. This procedure allowed recovery of > 70% of the alkanes and methylnaphthalenes added to tissue, and min detectable levels were 0.08-0.15 and 0.03-0.04 ug/g, respectively.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Methylated naphthalenes is found on List C. Case No: 3088; Pesticide type: insecticide, fungicide; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered. Therefore, we are characterizing the case as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): methylated naphthalenes; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered products ... cancelled.\" /Methylated naphthalenes/"

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer saftey standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Methylated naphthalenes is found on List C. Case No: 3088; Pesticide type: insecticide, fungicide; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered. Therefore, we are characterizing the case as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): methylated naphthalenes; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered products ... cancelled.\" /Methylated naphthalenes/"

Methylnaphthalenes are used as chemical intermediates, general solvents and in vitamin K production. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Methylnaphthalene is presumably less toxic than naphthalene. The only untoward effects reported in man are skin irritation and skin photosensitization. Individuals with erythrocytic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may be particularly susceptible to possible hemolytic effects. ANIMAL STUDIES: Induces the formation of cataracts and causes spleen and kidney damage. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis was induced in mice given twice weekly dermal applications on their backs of 119 mg/kg methylnaphthalene in acetone for 30 weeks. Control mice treated with acetone showed no signs of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The test material was specified as a mixture of 1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene, but the relative proportions of the two isomers in the mixture were not reported. Gross examination of the lungs of exposed animals revealed multiple, grayish white soft spots or nodules sharply demarcated from the pinkish-white surrounding normal tissue, without specific localization; such gross lesions were not found in control lungs. Light microscopy showed the alveoli to be filled with amorphous eosinophilic material, many mononucleated cells with abundant foamy cytoplasm, and many clefts corresponding to cholesterol crystals separating the intra-alveolar materials and the lining cells. Alveolar walls were thickened without prominent fibrosis. Electron microscopy revealed that alveolar spaces contained extracellular membranous material (myelinoid structures) and mononucleated giant cells (balloon cells) containing myelinoid structures, lipid droplets, and amorphous crystals. Terminal bronchioles were not markedly affected. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Radiolabeled methylnaphthalene was taken up from food and water by the blue crab Callinectes sapidus. Of the radioactivity assimilated, more than 50% was in the hepatopancreas, suggesting the site of hydrocarbon metabolism. No evidence found of hydrocarbon storage by any tissues.",

It is used in insecticide manufacturing; manufacture of phthalic anhydride; solvent in organic synthesis; asphalt and naptha constituent. It is also used as a test substance for the determination of the cetane number of diesel fuels. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: In contrast to naphthalene, the only reported effects of methylated naphthalene in man are skin irritation and skin photosensitization. Chromosome analyses were carried out in human lymphocytes treated in vitro with 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene in the presence and absence of the mammalian metabolic activation system. Without metabolic activation there was no indication of induction of any significant cytogenetic effect by either compound. With metabolic activation a weak clastogenic effect was apparent at 4 mM 2-methylnaphthalene only and sister chromatid exchange frequencies were significantly increased at each dose of 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, yet always less than twice the control level. The present observations do not indicate that 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene must be classified as potential genotoxic substances.ANIMAL STUDIES: Pure 1-methylnaphthalene increased the reticulocyte counts in the splenectomized dogs but not the intact dogs. Reticulocyte values remained elevated for 10 days after the fogging ceased. Practical grade 1-methylnaphthalene increased leukocyte counts in intact and splenectomized dogs and neutrophil counts in intact dogs, but pure 1-methylnaphthalene had no effect on these parameters. Methylated naphthalene derivatives resulted in concentration-dependent decrease in pain sensitivity in rats and depression of respiratory rate in mice. 1-Methylnaphthalene may be a weak lung carcinogen in male, but not female, mice. At a carcinogenic dose it dooes not induce overt toxicity for any organs and has no in vivo genotoxicity in the lungs. 1- and 2-Methylnaphthalene were tested quantitatively using S. thyphimurium TA98 and TA100 with and without metabolic activation; the concentration used were 3 umol/plate. 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene were not mutagenic. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: In toxicity study of petroleum oils on post-larvae of brown shrimp, grass shrimp, and sheepshead minnow, refined oils were more toxic than crude oils due to presence of naphthalene and alkylnaphthalene, including 1-methylnaphthalene. The different naphthalenes were toxic at levels between 0.08 and 5.1 ppm.",

Cancer bioassays of naphthalene in mice have demonstrated a slight increase in bronchiolar/alveolar adenomas in female mice, and in inflammation and metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity. Similar work in rats demonstrated a significant, and concentration-dependent increase in the incidence of respiratory epithelial adenomas and neuroblastomas in the nasal epithelium of both male and female rats. Although the studies on the acute toxicity of the methylnaphthalene derivatives are more limited, it appears that the species selective toxicity associated with naphthalene administration also is observed with methylnaphthalenes. Chronic administration of the methylnaphthalenes, however, failed to demonstrate the same oncogenic potential as that observed with naphthalene. The information available on the isopropylnaphthalene derivatives suggests that they are not cytotoxic. Like the methylnaphthalenes, 1-nitronaphthalene causes lesions in both Clara and ciliated cells. However, the species selective lung toxicity observed in the mouse with both naphthalene and the methylnaphthalenes is not seen with 1-nitronaphthalene. With 1-nitronaphthalene, the rat is far more susceptible to parenteral administration of the compound than mice. The wide-spread distribution of these compounds in the environment and the high potential for low level exposure to humans supports a need for further work on the mechanisms of toxicity in animal models with attention to whether these processes are applicable to humans. Although it is tempting to suppose that the toxicity and mechanisms of toxicity of the alkylnaphthalenes and nitronaphthalenes are similar to naphthalene, there is sufficient published literature to suggest that this may not be the case. Certainly the enzymes involved in the metabolic activation of each of these substrates are likely to differ. The available data showing extensive oxidation of the aromatic nucleus of naphthalene, nitronaphthalene and the methylnaphthalenes (with some oxidation of the methyl group) contrast with the isopropylnaphthalene derivatives, where the major metabolites involve side chain oxidation. Overall, these data support the view that ring epoxidation is a key step in the process involved in cytotoxicity. Whether the epoxide itself or a downstream metabolite mediates the toxic effects is still not clear even with naphthalene, the best studied of this group of compounds. Additional work is needed in several areas to further assess the potential human health consequences of exposure to these agents. These studies should involve the definition of the extent and severity of methylnaphthalene toxicity after single dose exposures with attention to both the nasal and respiratory epithelia. The cytochromes P450 responsible for the initial activation of these agents in rodents with subsequent complimentary studies in primate models should help determine whether key metabolic processes responsible for toxicity occur also in primates. Finally, the precise involvement of reactive metabolite formation and adduction of cellular proteins in toxicity will be important in not only assessing the potential for human toxicity, but also in developing an understanding of the genetic and environmental factors which could alter the toxicity of these agents.",

With S9 mix a weak clastogenic effect was apparent at 4 mM 2-methylnaphthalene only and sister chromatid exchange frequencies were significantly increased at each dose of 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, yet always less than twice the control level.

Fifteen control mice treated with acetone showed no signs of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The test material was specified as a mixture of 1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene, but the relative proportions of the two isomers in the mixture were not reported. Gross examination of the lungs of exposed animals revealed multiple, grayish white soft spots or nodules sharply demarcated from the pinkish-white surrounding normal tissue, without specific localization; such gross lesions were not found in control lungs. Light microscopy showed the alveoli to be filled with amorphous eosinophilic material, many mononucleated cells with abundant foamy cytoplasm, and many clefts corresponding to cholesterol crystals separating the intra-alveolar materials and the lining cells. Alveolar walls were thickened without prominent fibrosis. Electron microscopy revealed that alveolar spaces contained extracellular membranous material (myelinoid structures) and mononucleated giant cells (balloon cells) containing myelinoid structures, lipid droplets, and amorphous crystals. Terminal bronchioles were not markedly affected. Based on these findings, /it was/... hypothesized that initial damage to type I pneumocytes by methylnaphthalenes or metabolites was followed by compensatory hyperplasia and hypertrophy of type II pneumocytes and the eventual development of balloon cells that liberated numerous myelinoid structures when they ruptured.",

Cancer bioassays of naphthalene in mice have demonstrated a slight increase in bronchiolar/alveolar adenomas in female mice, and in inflammation and metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity. Similar work in rats demonstrated a significant, and concentration-dependent increase in the incidence of respiratory epithelial adenomas and neuroblastomas in the nasal epithelium of both male and female rats. Although the studies on the acute toxicity of the methylnaphthalene derivatives are more limited, it appears that the species selective toxicity associated with naphthalene administration also is observed with methylnaphthalenes. Chronic administration of the methylnaphthalenes, however, failed to demonstrate the same oncogenic potential as that observed with naphthalene. The information available on the isopropylnaphthalene derivatives suggests that they are not cytotoxic. Like the methylnaphthalenes, 1-nitronaphthalene causes lesions in both Clara and ciliated cells. However, the species selective lung toxicity observed in the mouse with both naphthalene and the methylnaphthalenes is not seen with 1-nitronaphthalene. With 1-nitronaphthalene, the rat is far more susceptible to parenteral administration of the compound than mice. The wide-spread distribution of these compounds in the environment and the high potential for low level exposure to humans supports a need for further work on the mechanisms of toxicity in animal models with attention to whether these processes are applicable to humans. Although it is tempting to suppose that the toxicity and mechanisms of toxicity of the alkylnaphthalenes and nitronaphthalenes are similar to naphthalene, there is sufficient published literature to suggest that this may not be the case. Certainly the enzymes involved in the metabolic activation of each of these substrates are likely to differ. The available data showing extensive oxidation of the aromatic nucleus of naphthalene, nitronaphthalene and the methylnaphthalenes (with some oxidation of the methyl group) contrast with the isopropylnaphthalene derivatives, where the major metabolites involve side chain oxidation. Overall, these data support the view that ring epoxidation is a key step in the process involved in cytotoxicity. Whether the epoxide itself or a downstream metabolite mediates the toxic effects is still not clear even with naphthalene, the best studied of this group of compounds. Additional work is needed in several areas to further assess the potential human health consequences of exposure to these agents. These studies should involve the definition of the extent and severity of methylnaphthalene toxicity after single dose exposures with attention to both the nasal and respiratory epithelia. The cytochromes P450 responsible for the initial activation of these agents in rodents with subsequent complimentary studies in primate models should help determine whether key metabolic processes responsible for toxicity occur also in primates. Finally, the precise involvement of reactive metabolite formation and adduction of cellular proteins in toxicity will be important in not only assessing the potential for human toxicity, but also in developing an understanding of the genetic and environmental factors which could alter the toxicity of these agents.",

Each compound was dispersed in the atmosphere in a refined kerosene base using a fogger. Exposures occurred on four consecutive mornings. Based on the information presented, it was not possible to determine the exposure concentration. Pure 1-methylnaphthalene increased the reticulocyte counts in the splenectomized dogs but not the intact dogs. Reticulocyte values remained elevated for 10 days after the fogging ceased. Practical grade 1-methylnaphthalene increased leukocyte counts in intact and splenectomized dogs and neutrophil counts in intact dogs, but pure 1-methylnaphthalene had no effect on these parameters. 2-Methylnaphthalene had no effect on any of the parameters monitored. Neither 1-methylnaphthalene nor 2-methylnaphthalene had an effect on hematocrit values, suggesting that these compounds do not cause hemolysis under the conditions of the study. Since the increased reticulocyte counts were seen only in splenectomized dogs, it is difficult to interpret whether or not this change signifies increased hematopoiesis in response to 1-methylnaphthalene exposure",

Rotarod performance and pain sensitivity behavior were tested in rats exposed to 1-methylnaphthalene at concentrations of 152-407 mg/cu m, and 2-methylnaphthalene at concentrations of 229-522 mg/cu m immediately after termination of a 4 hr exposure. The respiratory rate was measured in mice by the whole body pletysmographic method in 6 min duration exposure to various concentrations of 1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene. Exposure to both methylated naphthalene derivatives resulted in concentration-dependent decrease in pain sensitivity in rats and depression of respiratory rate in mice. At the concentrations applied no statistically significant disturbances in rotarod performance behavior were observed. The concentrations depressing the respiratory rate to 50% (RD50) were 129 mg/cu m and 67 mg/cu m, for 1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene, respectively. As based on RD50 values, the MAC values of 4 mg/cu m for 1-methylnaphthalene, and of 2 mg/cu m for 2-methylnaphthalene are suggested.",

It was reported that no histopathological lesions were detected in any organs in any of the groups. Growth retardation associated with decreased food intake in mice of both sexes in the two highest groups was the only adverse effect noted in this 13-wk study. Food intake data were not reported..., but the following estimates of administered daily doses were calculated assuming an average daily dose of 142 mg/kg for the 0.147% group, based on the reported intake for the 0.15% group in the 81-week study and proportional changes with the other dose groups: 0, 16, 47, 142, 425, and 1,259 mg/kg. Actual doses for the two highest dose groups likely were lower than these estimates, since mice in these groups consumed food at a lower rate.",

Male B6C3F1-mice were maintained on a diet containing 0.1-1% coal-tar for 15 days. The tar consisted primarily of 43.0 g/kg naphthalene, 24.0 g/kg 1-methylnaphthalene, 42.0 g/kg 2-methylnaphthalene, 19 g/kg phenanthrene, 7.8 g/kg pyrene, and 1.7 g/kg benzo(a)pyrene. Body weight gain and feed consumption were monitored. The mice were killed on day 20 and the lungs and forestomach were removed. The DNA was isolated and analyzed for adducts by a phosphorus-32 post labeling procedure. Mice receiving diets containing 0.5 and 1% coal-tar refused to eat for 2 and 4 days, respectively, and lost weight. They eventually tolerated the diets. Mice on the 0.5%, but not the 1% diet, regained lost body weight. Mice fed diets containing 0.1 and 0.2% coal-tar readily accepted the diets and showed normal body weight gain. A dose related increase in lung DNA adduct formation was observed. The concentrations of forestomach DNA adducts were increased, but the increases were not dose related. Forestomach DNA adduct concentrations were higher in animals fed the 0.1 and 0.2% diet. Mice were fed diets containing 0.25% of the coal-tar mixture or three other coal-tars differing in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) composition or a mixture of all four coal-tars for 15 days. Urinary excretion of 1-hydroxypyrene (1OHPy) and 3-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene (3OHBaP) was measured on day one and day 14. The mice were killed on day 16 and the forestomach, lungs, and spleen were removed and analyzed for DNA adducts. The concentration of adducts in the lung, forestomach, and spleen did not correlate with the total PAH content of the tar samples. Urinary excretion of 1OHPy correlated with the pyrene content of the samples. 3OHBaP was not detected in the urine samples.",

Methylnaphthalenes are released upon combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels. Methylnaphthalenes are a component of crude oil. If released to air, vapor pressures of 0.067 and 0.055 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C for 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, respectively, indicate that they will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase methylnaphthalenes will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrogen pentoxide; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 7.3-7.4 hours, 29-88 days and 9.6-12 days, respectively. Methylnaphthalenes contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methylnaphthalenes are expected to have slight to no mobility based upon Koc values of 2290-8500. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon Henry's Law constants of 5.14X10-4 and 5.18X10-4 atm-cu m/mole for 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, respectively. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Methylnaphthalenes are not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon the vapor pressures. Methylnaphthalenes should biodegrade rapidly in the environment where  micro-organisms have acclimated to polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and at a moderate rate in unacclimated soils and aquatic systems. If released into water, methylnaphthalenes are expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon these compound's Henry's Law constants. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.5 hours and 5.3 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. Direct photolysis of methylnaphthalenes in water had predicted half-lives of 22 and 54 hours. BCF values of 30-1800 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high, the compound may be metabolized by the organism, decreasing the BCF. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to methylnaphthalenes may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methylnaphthalenes are produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methylnaphthalenes via inhalation of ambient air and cigarette smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and use of smokeless tobacco products.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.067 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-methylnaphthalene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-methylnaphthalene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrogen pentoxide; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 7.3 hours, 88 days and 12 days, respectively. 1-Methylnaphthalene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-methylnaphthalene is expected to have slight to no mobility based upon log Koc values of 2.76-5.78. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.14X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 1-Methylnaphthalene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, <5% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil. However, 1-methylnaphthalene is expected to biodegrade rapidly in soil and water acclimated to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and at a slower rate in unacclimated environments. If released into water, 1-methylnaphthalene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. 1-Methylnaphthalene was completely removed within <7-14 days from acclimated groundwater aquifer grab samples. Unacclimated material from the aquifer degraded 1-methylnaphthalene at an average rate of 3.6% per week. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.5 hours and 5.3 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 23-41 days if adsorption is considered. BCF values of 30-810 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to high. However, the compound may be metabolized by the organism decreasing the BCF. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1-methylnaphthalene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-methylnaphthalene is produced or used.

Volatilization of methylnaphthalenes from moist soil surfaces is expected(SRC) given Henry's Law constants of 5.14X10-4 and 5.18X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4)  for 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, respectively. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). Methylnaphthalenes are not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon vapor pressures of 0.067 mm Hg(5) and 0.055 mm Hg(6) for 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, respectively. Grab samples of groundwater aquifer soil that had acclimated to creosote wastes containing methylnaphthalene were able to degrade methylnaphthalenes, present at 0.02 to 0.12 ppm, under aerobic conditions at 25 \u00b0C in less than a week(7). Unacclimated material from the same aquifer degraded methylnaphthalenes at an average rate of 3.5% per week(7); these studies show that methylnaphthalenes will biodegrade, but is more likely after acclimation(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon Henry's Law constants of 5.14X10-4 and 5.18X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(5) for 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, respectively. Using these Henry's Law constants and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.5 hours and 5.3 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 23 to 78 days if adsorption is considered(6). Methylnaphthalenes are not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values of 30-1800 in Coho salmon(8), Starry flounder(8) and carp(9), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high(SRC), the compound may be metabolized by the organism decreasing the BCF(SRC). The direct photolysis half-life for midday, midsummer sunlight at 40 deg N latitude was predicted to be 22 and 54 h for 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene in water solution, respectively(10). A marine water die-away study with sediment inoculum from Dunstaffnage Bay, Oban, Scotland showed a 92 and 88.5% loss of 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, respectively, contained in crude oil after 7 days at 20 \u00b0C(11).",

Vapor-phase methylnaphthalenes are degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 7 hours(SRC), calculated from rate constants of 5.3X10-11 and 5.23X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4). The respective rate constants for the vapor-phase reaction of 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene with ozone have been measured to be <1.3X10-19 and <4X10-19 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(5), which corresponds to atmospheric half-lives of about 88 and 29 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 molecules per cu cm(SRC). The rate constants for the vapor-phase reaction of methylnaphthalenes with nitrogen pentoxide have been measured to be 4.2X10-17 and 3.3X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C which corresponds to atmospheric half-lives of about 9.6 and 12 days, respectively, at an atmospheric concentration of 2X10+10 nitrogen pentoxide molecules per cu cm(5). Methylnaphthalenes contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Volatilization of 1-methylnaphthalene from moist soil surfaces is expected(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 5.14X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). 1-Methylnaphthalene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.067 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, <5% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks(6) indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC). 1-Methylnaphthalene should biodegrade rapidly in soils acclimated to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and at a slower rate in unacclimated soils(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.14X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.5 hours and 5.3 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 23-41 days if adsorption is considered(6). 1-Methylnaphthalene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values of 30-810 in Coho salmon(8), Starry flounder(8) and carp(9), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to high, the compound may be metabolized by the organism decreasing the BCF(SRC). The direct photolysis half-life for 1-methylnaphthalene in sunlit waters at midday, midsummer and 40 deg N latitude was predicted to be 22 hr(10). 1-Methylnaphthalene was completely removed within <7-14 days from acclimated groundwater aquifer grab samples(11-12). Unacclimated material from the aquifer degraded 1-methylnaphthalene at an average rate of 3.6% per week(12).",

Vapor-phase 1-methylnaphthalene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.3 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.3X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 1-methylnaphthalene with ozone has been reported as <1.3X10-19 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of >88 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(4). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 1-methylnaphthalene with nitrogen pentoxide has been measured to be 3.3X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C which corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 12 days at an atmospheric concentration of 2X10+10 nitrogen pentoxide molecules per cu cm(3). 1-Methylnaphthalene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

No loss of 1-methylnaphthalene was observed for a 5 day BOD test with sewage seed at 20 \u00b0C(2). When marine water was used as an inoculate, 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene at respective concentrations of 0.045 and 0.067 ppm disappeared within 10 days under aerobic conditions at 25 \u00b0C(3). Using the Japanese MITI I procedure, <5% degradation of methylnaphthalene occurred in 28 days; for the MITI II test with a freshwater inoculum, 49 and 72% of the 1- and 2-isomers were lost in 28 days under aerobic conditions at 25 \u00b0C(4). A marine water die-away study with sediment inoculum from Dunstaffnage Bay, Oban, Scotland showed a 92 and 88.5% loss of 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, respectively, contained in crude oil after 7 days at 20 \u00b0C(5). Methylnaphthalenes, present at 0.5 ppm carbon, was completely removed within 14 days from acclimated fresh-well water grab samples from Tuffenwies and Zurich, Switzerland, with a pH of 8.0, at 10 and 25 \u00b0C and microbial populations of 300-400 cells/mL(6).

An average loss of 5.6 and 6.5% per week was observed for autoclaved controls(7). Unacclimated material from the same aquifer degraded methylnaphthalenes at an average rate of 3.5% per week; however autoclaved controls lost methylnaphthalenes at an overall rate of about 11% per week(7). Methylnaphthalene, present in light Arabian crude oil, showed little biodegradation in sea water, but when nutrients were added biodegradation increased; with sea water, sediment and nutrients, 100% biodegradation was seen in <10 days(8).",

Unacclimated material from the same aquifer degraded 1-methylnaphthalene at an average rate of 3.6% per week; however autoclaved controls lost 1-methylnaphthalene at an overall rate of 10.9% per week(2). A marine water die-away study with sediment inoculum from Dunstaffnage Bay, Oban, Scotland showed a 92% loss of 1-methylnaphthalene contained in crude oil after 7 days at 20 \u00b0C(3). After standardization to controls, the measure of C14 CO2 evolution from radio-labeled 1-methylnaphthalene contained in crude oil was 0.8, 2.2 and 0.8% for marine water grab samples from Saanich Inlet, Canada incubated at 12 \u00b0C for 1, 2 and 3 days, respectively(4). 1-Methylnaphthalene contained in biodiesel B20 had a biodegradation half-life of 3.9 days when incubated with an inoculum of unacclimated rainwater from a detention pond(5). The biodegradation of 1-methylnaphthalene was enhanced when in the presents of other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(6). In a bioslurry containing soil from a gasworks site 44, 36, 15 and 15% of 1-methylnaphthalene remained after 3, 7, 24 and 29 days of incubation, respectively(7).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 5.5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 5.3 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 23-41 days if adsorption is considered(3). 1-Methylnaphthalene's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 1-Methylnaphthalene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.067 mm Hg(4).",

Surrounding groundwater at a former pine-tar manufacturing site in Gainesville, FL contained 1-methylnaphthalene at 0.9-130 ug/L(2) 1-Methylnaphthalene was detected at 0.79, 0.30 and 0.46 mg/L at ground water depths of 6, 12 and 18 m, respectively, in Pensacola, FL in the vicinity of a wood treatment facility(3). At a Conroe, TX creosote waste facility groundwater contained 1-methylnaphthalene at 2.3-180.7 ug/L(4). 1-Methylnaphthalene was identified in the ground water leachate from the Waterloo and Northbay landfills, Ontario, Canada at 0.1-13 ug/L(5). 1-Methylnaphthalene at a concentration of 0.043 mg/L was found in groundwater at 15.5 feet below land surface in Feb 1990 from a field site in Galloway Township, NJ where an underground storage tank leaked gasoline(6). At a former asphalt factory in Ringe, Denmark that operated from 1915 to 1954, 1-methylnaphthalene concentrations in groundwater were not detected, 5, and 20 ug/L at 0, 25, and 25 meters from the source(7). At Holte Sollerod Gasworks, Denmark that operated from 1907 to 1963, 1-methylnaphthalene concentrations were 554, 40 and 11 ug/L at 0, 5 and 10 meters from the source(7). At Frederica Gasworks, Denmark that operated from 1866 to 1966, 1-methylnaphthalene was detected at 84 ug/L at 25 m from the source, and not detected at the remaining wells; the limit of detection was 5 ug/L(7). Groundwater collected in Mar 1990 from a well (21 m depth) on the site of a Florida creosote plant contained 1-methylnaphthalene at 4.7 mg/L(8). 1-Methylnaphthalene concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 1.1 mg/L in groundwater from 10 of 16 wells sampled in Oct 1986 at a site in Seattle, Washington that was the location of a coal and oil gasification plant that ceased operation in 1956(9).",

Water was collected 1987 to 1989 from the head and mouth of the St. Clair River, which runs between Ontario Canada and Michigan; 1-methylnaphthalene concentrations were 0.20-4.02 ng/L at Point Edward (head) and 0.19-20.6 ng/L at Port Lambton (mouth) with respective mean concentrations of 0.84 and 1.27 ng/L(5). 1-Methylnaphthalene was detected in water samples collected Jun and Aug 1988 from four stations along the Rainy River on the Ontario, Canada and Minnesota boarder at concentrations of 1.5-161.8 ng/L and not detected in the suspended solids (detection limit 10.0 ng/g)(6). 1-Methylnaphthalene was found in the Rainy River where final effluent from two bleached kraft mills discharge directly into the river at 283.1-1111.0 ng/L and at <10-56 ng/g in the suspended solids(6). Surface water collected in Mar 1990 from a stream adjacent to a creosote works facility in Florida contained 1-methylnaphthalene at 0.0148 mg/L(7). 1-Methylnaphthalene was detected at <1.0-2.1 ng/L in the San Joaquin River, CA and its tributaries in 1992(8). 1-Methylnaphthalene was not detected in six cave rivers located in northeastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas, not detected in Little Osage Creek, AR, but was detected in an unnamed creek in Oklahoma at 26.3 ng/POCIS sample (polar organic chemical integrative sampler), samples were collected May to July 2006(9). 1-Methylnaphthalene was not detected (detection limit 0.5 ug/L) in 21 samples collected from rivers in Arkansas Mar, Apr and Aug 2004(10). 1-Methylnaphthalene was not detected in samples collected in 2001 from 23 stream locations upstream and downstream of 10 cities in Iowa(11).",

The third facility, in an industrial area, did not report a concentration of methylnaphthalene(2). Coal tar leachate was found to contain methylnaphthalenes(3-4). Methylnaphthalenes were also detected in the municipal wastewaters  from 4 major treatment plants in southern California(5). Methylnaphthalenes were found in Los Angeles County effluent at 20 ug/L(6). Methylnaphthalenes were also identified as a stack  emission(7) and a component of fly ash(8) from waste incinerators. Data from Aug 25 to Sept 7, 1979 showed for a speed of 80 km/hr on straight and level highway, gasoline powered vehicles emitted methylnaphthalenes at an average rate of 5.2 mg/km and diesel trucks emitted methylnaphthalenes at an average of 1.5 mg/km(9). Methylnaphthalene was emitted from the burning of scrap tires in a horizontal, laboratory scale reactor at 470 and 500 mg/kg at 650 and 750 \u00b0C, respectively, at 850, 950 and 1050 \u00b0C no methylnaphthalene was detected(10). Methylnaphthalenes were detected in the emissions of automobiles running on gasoline, diesel and JP-8 aviation fuel(11). Large amounts of methylnaphthalenes were emitted from an electric shaver(12).",

The dissolved air floatation effluent of a Class B oil refinery contained methylnaphthalenes at 259 ng/g(3). Effluents from refineries, petrochemical industry, metallurgic industry and municipal wastewater treatment plants in Norway contained methylnaphthalenes with a 62 to 68% frequency of appearance(4). Reactor tar from a coal gasification plant contained methylnaphthalenes at 29.6 mg/g(5). Effluent from a textile finishing operation also contained methylnaphthalenes(6). Methylnaphthalenes are produced during pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)(7). Methylnaphthalenes were found in the crude, purified, and flue gases of waste gasification and combustion of a pilot plant at concentrations of 21,500-77,000, 14,300-54,000, and 760-1,600 g/cu m, respectively(8). Methylnaphthalenes concentrations in the purified gas after addition of PVC and polyester were 1,200 and 11,900 g/cu m, respectively(8). Methylnaphthalenes concentrations in flue gas after fluid bed combustion of four coal species from South Africa, Poland, Spisbergen, and Ruhr area (Germany) were 800,000, 1,505,000, 1,100,000, and 2,200,000 ng/cu m, respectively(9).",

Gas phase 1-methylnaphthalene emission rates from fireplace combustion of pine, oak, and eucalyptus wood were 10.6, 6.39 and 4.31 mg/kg of wood burned(4). Data from Aug 25 to Sept 7 1979 showed for a speed of 80 km/hr on straight and level highway, gasoline powered vehicles and diesel trucks emitted 1-methylnaphthalene at an average rate of 1.8 and 1.3 mg/km, respectively(5). The 1-methylnaphthalene concentration in diesel powered medium duty truck emissions in the gas phase was 378 ug/km(6). The water concentration of 1-methylnaphthalene was shown to increase from 1 to 92 ng/L as a result of motorboat traffic in a canal of a fresh water lake(7). The emission rate of 1-methylnaphthalene emitted from the vehicle fleet in the Van Nuys Tunnel in Los Angeles on Sept 21, 1993 from 6 to 10 am, during morning traffic, was 25 mg/L(8). 1-Methylnaphthalene concentrations were found to range from 2.11 to 782 ng/filter in outboard marine engine particulate matter(9). Average emission rates of various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were measured under the Federal Testing Procedure (FTP) driving cycle, which represents urban driving, and the REP05 driving cycle, which includes conditions outside of the FTP(10). 1-Methylnaphthalene emission rates under the FTP cycle were 2.006, 0.962, and 3.157 mg/mi for tier 0 federal emissions package, tier 1 federal emissions package, and a high emitter category(10). For the REP05 cycle, emission rates were 0.211, 0.160, and 1.353 mg/mi for the same vehicle categories, respectively(10).",

The level of 1-methylnaphthalene in the digestive gland oil of lobsters ranged from 8.8 to 65.3 ng/g according to 4 different laboratories(2). 1-Methylnaphthalene concentrations in samples of the bivalve Corbicula fluminea from the San Joaquin River, CA and its tributaries in 1992 were <0.5 ng/g for all four sites sampled(3). 1-Methylnaphthalene was not detected (detection limit 10.0 ng/g) in five of the six composite fish samples of juvenile fish, yellow perch (Perca flavescens), logperch (Percina caprodes), and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieuui), collected from the Rainy River on the Ontario, Canada and Minnesota boarder in Aug 1988, upstream and downstream from two bleached kraft mills that discharged directly into this river(4). The 1-methylnaphthalene concentration in a logperch sample collected 5 km downstream from the mill discharges was 18.1 ng/g(4). 1-Methylnaphthalene was detected in the muscle samples of Solea solea (bottom-feeding fish), Diplodus vulgaris (pelagic fish), Donax truaulus (bivalve) and Peneaus japonicus (crustacean) at 6.32, 92.25, 4.67 and 0.67 ng/g wet weight, respectively; samples were collected from Abu Qir Bay in the Mediterranean Sea Feb 2004(5). 1-Methylnaphthalene concentrations in American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) were 81.6-191, 88.9-90.3, 59.9-79.0, 67.0-268 and 40.2-151 ng/g dry weight in samples collected from Atasta, Chica, Pargo, Chumpan and Chacahito locations of Terminos Lagoon, Mexico, respectively; samples were collected Feb to July 1991(6).",

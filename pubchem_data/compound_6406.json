Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Tachypnea (rapid respiratory rate) may be followed by respiratory depression. Lung hemorrhage and pulmonary edema may also occur. Headache, vertigo (dizziness), agitation, and giddiness may be followed by combative behavior, convulsions, paralysis, protruding eyeballs, dilated and unreactive pupils, and coma. Acetone cyanohydrin is irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. Lacrimation (tearing) and a burning sensation of the mouth and throat are common. Excessive salivation, nausea, and vomiting may also occur.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

If vomiting occurs, lean patient forward or place on left side (head-down position, if possible) to maintain an open airway and prevent aspiration. Keep patient quiet and maintain normal body temperature. Obtain medical attention. /Cyanide and related compounds/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.1 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates acetone cyanohydrin will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase acetone cyanohydrin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days. If released to soil, acetone cyanohydrin is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. However, acetone cyanohydrin dissociates readily in contact with water to form acetone and hydrogen cyanide; the hydrolysis rate is 4.47 1/hr (half-life of 9 minutes) observed in aqueous solution at pH 7.02 and 26 \u00b0C. Therefore, leaching of acetone cyanohydrin in moist soils or volatilization from moist soils are not expected to be important fate process due to hydrolysis. Acetone cyanohydrin is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A 53-64% theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test classifies acetone cyanohydrin as readily biodegradable, although the test may have been evaluating the acetone hydrolysis product. If released into water, hydrolysis is expected to be the dominant fate process. Due to hydrolysis, adsorption to sediment, volatilization, and bioconcentration are not expected to be important fate processes. Adsorption to suspended solids and sediment is not expected based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.23X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to acetone cyanohydrin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where acetone cyanohydrin is produced or used. (SRC)",

However, acetone cyanohydrin dissociates readily in contact with water to form acetone and hydrogen cyanide(3); the hydrolysis rate is 4.47 1/hr (half-life of 9 minutes) observed in aqueous solution at pH 7.02 and 26 \u00b0C(3). Therefore, leaching of acetone cyanohydrin in moist soils or volatilization from moist soils are not expected to be important fate processes due to hydrolysis(SRC). Acetone cyanohydrin is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.1 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4). A 53-64% theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(5) classifies acetone cyanohydrin as readily biodegradable(5), although the test may have been evaluating the acetone hydrolysis product(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.23X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 1.1 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4), and assigned value for water solubility of 1X10+6 mg/L (miscible)(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -0.03(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The dominant fate process in water is hydrolysis (dissociation), forming acetone and hydrogen cyanide, which has rate constant of 4.47 1/hr at pH 7.02 and 26.0 \u00b0C(7) which corresponds to a half-life of about 9 minutes(SRC). Due to hydrolysis, adsorption to sediment, volatilization, and bioconcentration are not expected to be important fate processes(SRC). A 53-64% theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(8) classifies acetone cyanohydrin as readily biodegradable(8), although the test may have been evaluating the acetone hydrolysis product(SRC).",

An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Acetone cyanohydrin, present at 100 mg/L, reached 53-64% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test which classified the compound as readily biodegradable(2). Acetone cyanohydrin dissociates in water (an equilibrium reaction), with half-life of 9 minutes at neutral pH, to form acetone and hydrogen cyanide(3); using the same Japanese MITI test, acetone has theoretical BOD of 98%(2) which might suggest the presence of hydrogen cyanide decreases the biodegradation rate with respect to acetone cyanohydrin in this test(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that acetone cyanohydrin is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water surfaces(3). In addition, a hydrolysis rate of 4.47 1/hr (half-life 9 minutes) at pH 7.02 at 26 \u00b0C(4) indicates that volatilization from water is unlikely to occur. Acetone cyanohydrin is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

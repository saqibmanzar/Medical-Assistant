When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In this open, multicenter, randomized, controlled study, eligible patients with periarthritis of the shoulder were randomized to receive either oxaprozin 1200 mg once daily (n = 49) or diclofenac 50 mg three times daily (n = 47). The treatment period was 15 +/- 1 days. The study was planned on a hypothesis of equivalence between the two study drugs. The primary study endpoint was the change from baseline at day 15 in the patient-assessed shoulder pain score. Secondary efficacy variables included investigator-assessed shoulder function, patient-assessed quality of life on the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) Acute Health Survey and both patients' and investigators' overall assessment of efficacy. At day 15, the mean changes in shoulder pain score from baseline in the oxaprozin and diclofenac groups were -5.85 +/- SD 4.62 and -5.54 +/- SD 4.41, respectively. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant, confirming the hypothesis of the study that oxaprozin is as effective as diclofenac. Investigator-assessed shoulder function improved in both groups but more so in the oxaprozin group (p = 0.028 at day 15). Quality of life as measured by SF-36 total score was also improved in both treatment groups, with a trend toward greater improvement in the oxaprozin group. Furthermore, a significantly more favorable effect on the SF-36 'mental health' item was observed in oxaprozin compared with diclofenac-treated patients at day 15 (p = 0.0202). As assessed by investigators, the overall efficacy of oxaprozin was superior to that for diclofenac at visit 3 (8 +/- 1 days) (p = 0.0067). Patients also assessed the overall efficacy of oxaprozin as superior to that of diclofenac at visits 3 (8 +/- 1 days) (p = 0.0235) and 4 (15 +/- 1 days) (p = 0.0272). Only six adverse events, all of which were mild or moderate in intensity and occurred in four diclofenac recipients, were observed in the study. As expected, once-daily oxaprozin proved to be as effective as diclofenac three times daily in reducing the primary efficacy variable of patient-assessed shoulder pain score in patients with periarthritis of the shoulder refractory to previous treatments with other NSAIDs. Oxaprozin was shown to be superior to diclofenac in improving shoulder function and was considered by investigators and patients to have greater overall efficacy than diclofenac. In addition, oxaprozin showed a trend toward superior results in improving patients' quality of life compared with diclofenac. A trend towards better tolerability results for oxaprozin compared with diclofenac was also noted.",

Furthermore, the aqueous bioavailability of the drug formulation in the uninflamed and inflamed eyes was evaluated. Oxaprozin eye drops significantly reduced the signs of ocular inflammation elicited by sodium arachidonate on conjunctiva and iris. Oxaprozin treatment significantly reduced the levels of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and protein concentration in aqueous samples obtained from the eyes treated with arachidonate. Present data suggest, for the first time, that oxaprozin may be employed topically to prevent ocular reactions where the arachidonic acid cascade is activated.",

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treated with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered. /Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/"

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Decreased clearance of the unbound drug was related predominantly to a decrease in the volume of distribution and not an increase in the half-life. This phenomenon is considered to have minimal impact on drug accumulation upon multiple dosing. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of total oxaprozin is approximately 11-17 L/70 kg. Oxaprozin is 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. At therapeutic drug concentrations, the plasma protein binding of oxaprozin is saturable, resulting in a higher proportion of the free drug as the total drug concentration is increased. With increases in single doses or following repetitive once-daily dosing, the apparent volume of distribution and clearance of total drug increased, while that of unbound drug decreased due to the effects of nonlinear protein binding. Oxaprozin penetrates into synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis patients with oxaprozin concentrations 2-fold and 3-fold greater than in plasma and synovial fluid, respectively. Oxaprozin is expected to be excreted in human milk based on its physical-chemical properties; however, the amount of oxaprozin excreted in breast milk has not been evaluated.",

The inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis constitutes the primary mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of these drugs. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that the anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs may be also partly due to their ability to scavenge ROS and RNS and to inhibit the respiratory burst of neutrophils triggered by various activator agents. Thus, the scavenging activity of these NSAIDs was evaluated against an array of ROS (O(2)(-), HO, HOCl, and ROO) and RNS (NO and ONOO(-)) using noncellular in vitro systems. The results obtained demonstrated that tolmetin, ketorolac, and oxaprozin were not active against O(2)(-), while acemetacin, indomethacin, and etodolac exhibited concentration-dependent effects. Oxaprozin was also the least active scavenger for HO, among all the tested NSAIDs shown to be active. The scavenging effect for HOCl was not observed for any of the tested NSAIDs. The ROO was effectively scavenged by etodolac, with the other tested NSAIDs being much less active. NO and ONOO(-) were scavenged by all the tested NSAIDs.",

Other than being a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, the drug is capable of inhibiting both anandamide hydrolase in neurons (median inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 85 umol/L), with consequent potent analgesic activity, and NF-kappaB activation in inflammatory cells (IC50 = 50 umol/L). Moreover, oxaprozin induces apoptosis of activated monocytes in a dose-dependent manner, with the effect being detectable at a concentration of 5 micromol/L and reaching the maximum activity at 50 umol/L. As monocyte-macrophages and NF-kappaB pathways are crucial for synthesis of proinflammatory and histotoxic mediators in inflamed joints, oxaprozin appears to be endowed with pharmacodynamic properties exceeding those presently assumed as markers of classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.",

Elevations in hepatic transaminase concentrations and now fulminant hepatic failure have been shown to occur with oxaprozin, as previously seen with other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Transaminitis is a known adverse effect of NSAID use, but is usually mild and reversible with discontinuation of drug. Transaminitis may be more likely to occur in the elderly, in patients receiving concurrent potentially hepatotoxic medications, and possibly with the newer long-acting NSAIDs.

This condition was first described in the 1960s and was initially related to the use of certain antibiotic drugs. In 1985, pseudoporphyria was first attributed to the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). ... six patients diagnosed with pseudoporphyria /are described/ ... The patients ranged in age from 27 to 59 years and had a female:male predominance of 2:1. The offending NSAID was DayPro (oxaprozin) for three of the patients, Relafen (nabumetone) for two of the patients, and Aleve (naproxen) for one patient. For each patient, histology and immunofluorescence was either consistent with the diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda or nonspecific, while serum, stool, and urine porphyrins did not support that diagnosis. Withdrawal of the offending agent provided relief from the clinical symptoms for each patient. None of our patients were rechallenged with the putative offending drug. However, prolonged avoidance has provided a sustained remission from symptoms in all six patients. Pseudoporphyria is a relatively rarely reported condition. Clinical suspicion with appropriate laboratory and histopathologic findings help to make this diagnosis, and exclude true porphyrias. Rechallenge with the offending drug to produce symptom relapse has been proposed to be helpful in confirming this diagnosis of exclusion. Since all 6 patients with drug-induced pseudoporphyria experienced resolution of their symptoms after discontinuing the offending agent, we propose that this clinical correlation alone is sufficient to confirm this diagnosis. ...",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

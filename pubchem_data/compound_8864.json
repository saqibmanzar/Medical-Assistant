When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Exposure to this colorless liquid may occur from its use as a solvent; as an intermediate in the manufacture of divinylbenzene; and in powderless etching. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and protective clothing.  If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. 1,3-Diethylbenzene may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames. Containers of this substance may expl ode in the heat of a fire.  Also, its heavier-than-air vapor may travel to a source of ignition and flash back, or may accumulate to explosive concentrations in confined spaces such as sewers. For fires involving 1,3-diethylbenzene, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or standard foam. Isolate the area for 1/2 mile in all directions if a tank, rail car, or tank truck is involved in the fire.  For small spills of 1,3-diethylbenzene, take up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and place into containers for later disposal. For large spills, use water spray to reduce vapor and dike far ahead of the spill for later disposal.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,3-diethylbenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,3-diethylbenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 day. 1,3-Diethylbenzene absorbs light in the environmental UV spectrum, and thus has the potential for direct photolysis. If released to soil, 1,3-diethylbenzene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1600. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.00883 atm-cu m m/mole. 1,3-Diethylbenzene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 1,3-diethylbenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.3 hr and 5 days, respectively. Groundwater and marine water grab sample tests suggests that 1,3-diethylbenzene will biodegrade completely in groundwater in 5 days and to a lesser extent in marine water, rate not specified. An estimated BCF of 520 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 1,3-diethylbenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,3-diethylbenzene is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 1,3-diethylbenzene via inhalation of ambient air, and dermal contact with this compound and other consumer products containing 1,3-diethylbenzene, such as gasoline.

Vapor-phase 1,3-diethylbenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 day(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 14.2X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C determined using a structure estimation method(3). 1,3-Diethylbenzene absorbs UV light at wavelengths of >290 nm(4) and thus has the potential to undergo direct photolysis in the environment.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that 1,3-diethylbenzene is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this estimated Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 1.3 hr(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). 1,3-Diethylbenzene's estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 1,3-diethylbenzene from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.2 mm Hg(1).",

Off-gas concns from the Skyway Waste treatment and Highland Creek plant in Ontario, Canada were consisted of 30 and 368 ug/cu m 1,3-diethylbenzene, respectively(3). 1,3-Diethylbenzene was contained in the Dissolved Air Flotation treatment effluent of a Class B oil refinery at a concn of 13 ng/g(4). 1,3-Diethylbenzene was found at unquantified amounts in the effluent sample of a water treatment plant(9). 1,3-Diethylbenzene was detected at a concn of 2.0 ug/cu m in a plume at a distance of 1 mile from its source, a General Motors facility located in Janesville, WI(5). 1,3-Diethylbenzene was detected in 5 of 21 industrial categories of wastewater effluents(6). Extract from the wastewater of paint and ink industry contained 1,3-diethylbenzene at an average concn of 15 mg/l; the extract from wastewater of a textile mill contained 1,3-diethylbenzene at an average concn of 238 mg/l; the extract from wastewater of automatic and other laundries contained 1,3-diethylbenzene at an average concn of 149 mg/l; the extract from wastewater of plastic manufacturing contained 1,3-diethylbenzene at an average concn of 46 mg/l; and the extract from wastewater of organic chemicals manufacturing contained 1,3-diethylbenzene at an average concn of 24 mg/l(5). Motorboats emitted 1,3-diethylbenzene to canal water with resultant concn ranging from 8 to 60 ng/l with an average of 41 ng/l for 8 samples(7). 1,3-Diethylbenzene was detected, but not quantified, as an introduced volatile organic compound in the water of a test stand basin after a four-stroke outboard motor filled with unleaded gasoline was left in operation for 10 minutes(8).",

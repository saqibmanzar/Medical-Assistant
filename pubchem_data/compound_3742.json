Nonetheless, it is prudent to avoid prolonged contact of blood with syringes containing ionic contrast media.  Serious, rarely fatal, thromboembolic events causing myocardial infarction and stroke have been reported during angiographic procedures with both ionic and nonionic contrast media. Therefore, meticulous intravascular administration technique is necessary, particularly during angiographic procedures, to minimize thromboembolic events. Numerous factors, including length of procedure, catheter and syringe material, underlying disease state and concomitant medications may contribute to the development of thromboembolic events. For these reasons, meticulous angiographic techniques are recommended including close attention to guidewire and catheter manipulation, use of manifold systems and/ or three-way stopcocks, frequent catheter flushing with heparinized saline solutions and minimizing the length of the procedure. The use of plastic syringes in place of glass syringes has been reported to decrease but not eliminate the likelihood of in vitro clotting.  Serious or fatal reactions have been associated with the administration of iodine containing radiopaque media. It is of utmost importance to be completely prepared to treat any contrast medium reaction.",

In such instances anuria has developed resulting in progressive uremia, renal failure and eventually death.

The risk in myelomatous patients is not a contraindication to the procedure; however, partial dehydration in the preparation of these patients for the examination is not recommended since this may predispose to precipitation of myeloma protein in the renal tubules. No form of therapy, including dialysis, has been successful in reversing the effect. Myeloma, which occurs most commonly in persons over 40, should be considered before instituting intravascular administration of contrast agents."

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

                        "Description": "In medicine, the term \"mechanism of action\" (also called MOA) is used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Ioxaglate is a molecule that consists of six iodine atoms and achieves water solubility by ionization; thus, it is a 3.0 ratio ionic agent.    By far the most successful and widely used contrast agents in use today are the iodinated contrast media, which were introduced into clinical practice in the 1950s. Approximately 75 million doses of iodinated contrast agents are administered worldwide each year.  The iodinated contrast agents fall into 4 groups. Each group has unique chemical, physical, and biologic properties. These various contrast agents are required to meet the demands of a broad variety of imaging modalities.   All agents share a similar function group\u2014a tri-iodinated benzene ring. Iodine plays an imperative role in the attenuation of x-ray signal. The atomic radius of a covalently bonded iodine atom is about 133 picometers, falling within the same range of the wavelengths of x-rays: 10 to 10,000 picometers. Therefore, x-rays are easily attenuated by the iodine atoms. In addition, iodine atoms covalently bonded to a benzene ring have 2 main advantages: (1) 3 large atoms located in such close proximity increase the effective molecular size, attenuating longer-wavelength x-rays, and (2) covalent bonding to a stable organic functional group (for example, benzene) decrease the risk of toxic adverse effects from free iodide molecules.   Ionization is an important characteristic to note in contrast media preparations. Compounds are classified as either ionic or nonionic. The ionic compounds dissociate in aqueous solution and therefore have a higher osmolality. The anion is the radiopaque portion of the molecule, however, both the anion and cation are osmotically active. Compared with nonionic media such as ioxaglic acid,  ionic contrast media have more adverse hemodynamic effects, especially in patients with heart disease. The nonionic media are water soluble but do not dissociate in solution. Nonionic agents possess lower osmolality because there are fewer particles in solution. The nonionic contrast agents are more hydrophilic than ionic agents, resulting in lower osmolality, reduced binding to plasma proteins, decreased tissue binding, and a decreased tendency to cross cell membranes.  The low-osmolality of ioxaglic acid reduces the risk of adverse events. The occurrence of adverse reactions is more common after the use of high-osmolarity agents: about 15% with a high-osmolarity agent versus 3% with a low-osmolarity agent.   The use of high-osmolarity agents has decreased significantly in recent years. Most adverse effects and adverse reactions to this group of drugs are multifactorial and are likely due to a combination of direct cellular toxicity, the ionic state (for example, ionic vs nonionic), or the osmolarity of the injected contrast drug.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

All of these reactions to ioxaglate were reversed by the pretreatment with gabexate mesilate (10 and 50 mg kg(-1), 5 min prior to injection) or nafamostat mesilate (3 and 10 mg kg(-1)), in which the inhibition was complete after injection of nafamostat mesilate (10 mg kg(-1)). Both gabexate mesilate and nafamostat mesilate inhibited the activity of purified human lung tryptase, although the latter compound was far more potent than the former. Ioxaglate enhanced the nafamostat-sensitive protease activity in the extracellular fluid of rat peritoneal mast cell suspensions. Tryptase enhanced the permeability of protein through the monolayer of cultured human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. Ioxaglate, when applied in combination with rat peritoneal mast cells, also produced the endothelial barrier dysfunction. These effects of tryptase and ioxaglate were reversed by nafamostat mesilate. Consistent with these findings, immunofluorescence morphological analysis revealed that tryptase or ioxaglate in combination with mast cells increased actin stress fiber formation while decreasing VE-cadherin immunoreactivity. Both of these actions of tryptase and ioxaglate were reversed by nafamostat mesilate. These findings suggest that tryptase liberated from mast cells plays a crucial role in the ioxaglate-induced pulmonary dysfunction. In this respect, nafamostat mesilate may become a useful agent for the cure or prevention of severe adverse reactions to radiographic contrast media.",

In a multicenter study, 20 patients with mild to severe reactions to iodinated contrast material and 20 control subjects without reactions were evaluated. Ionic contrast material was associated with 18 (90%) of 20 reactions. Concentrations of plasma histamine, tryptase, urinary methylhistamine, specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) against ioxitalamate or ioxaglate, and the anaphylatoxins C3a and C4a were measured with radioimmunoassays; complement C3 and C4 levels were measured with nephelometry. Histamine levels were increased in 14 patients; tryptase levels, in 16; and methylhistamine levels, in six. Histamine and tryptase values correlated with the severity of the reaction (P < 0.02 and P < 0.004, respectively). Significantly higher levels of specific IgE against ioxaglate (P < 0.005) and ioxitalamate (P = 0.045) were found in patients. No differences were found for complement fractions. Skin test results in two patients with life-threatening reactions were positive for the administered contrast material. /Investigators concluded that/ histamine release and mast cell triggering are related to severe reactions. An IgE-related mechanism is strongly suspected. ...",

Renal clearance studies were carried out 1 day before and 1 day after administration of Ioxaglate (173 +/- 37 mL) injected into each patient. None experienced any adverse reaction. Mean serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and urinary NAG excretion were unaltered by ioxaglate. No patient suffered a nephrotoxic reaction or acute oliguria that required dialysis as a result of the administration of contrast material. In the subset of seven patients receiving cyclosporine the same results were observed. In the subset of 10 patients with a GFR lower than 60 mL/min before injection of Ioxaglate were also observed no significant change in mean GFR, ERPF and urinary NAG excretion. Only two patients had a transient decrease of GFR of between 10 and 20%.

Normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats were administered with ionic low-osmolar ioxaglate, nonionic low-osmolar iopromide or normal saline injection. Apoptosis in kidney tubular cells was determined by the presence of positive terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP in situ nick end-labeling (TUNEL) stain. At 24 hours after administration, both ioxaglate and iopromide injections induced more apoptosis in diabetic (49.7% vs. 25.3% for ioxaglate; 37.7% vs. 25.3% for iopromide; both p<0.001) and normal (36.2% vs. 27.4%, p=0.002, for ioxaglate; 33.6% vs. 27.4%, p=0.029, for iopromide) kidney tubular cells than normal saline injections. Additionally, ioxaglate induced more apoptotic tubular cells in diabetic kidneys than in normal kidneys (p<0.001). Moreover, ioxaglate significantly induced more apoptotic cells than iopromide in diabetic kidneys, but not in normal kidneys (p<0.001, for diabetic rats; p=0.345, for normal rats). Ionic low-osmolar contrast media induced more apoptosis in tubular cells in diabetic kidneys than in normal kidneys. Notably, ionic contrast media induced more apoptosis than nonionic contrast media in diabetic kidneys.",

Nonionic (iohexol) and ionic (ioxaglate) contrast media were intravenously injected at 1.5 mL/min in rats. Pulmonary vascular permeability was evaluated by measuring the amount of Evans blue dye uptake as a quantitative marker of albumin extravasation in lung tissue. Intravenous injections of contrast media at doses of 4 and 6 g I/kg induced a dose-dependent increase in pulmonary vascular permeability. L-Arginine (an NO synthase substrate) and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) (an NO synthase inhibitor) prevented and aggravated, respectively, the increase in pulmonary vascular permeability induced by the contrast medium. An aggravating action of L-NNA was confirmed by morphological and histological observations, this action being blocked by L-arginine (300 mg/kg) but not by D-arginine. Isosorbide dinitrate (1-20 mg/kg), an NO donor, had a dose-dependent protective effect on ioxaglate-increased vascular permeability. /The investigators'/ experimental findings suggest that contrast media at high doses produce pulmonary edema by inhibiting endothelial NO production, and nitrovasodilators protect against this adverse effect in rats.",

In both models the degree of blood-brain barrier damage was assessed visually using Evans' Blue stain. Quantitative assessment of blood-brain barrier disruption was made by contrast enhancement as measured by CT of the dog brain, and by 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake by the brain in the rabbit model. No Evans' Blue staining was observed in any study using the canine/CT model. Slight staining was observed in two studies with ioxaglate using the rabbit/pertechnetate model. Statistical analysis of results from the canine/CT model did not detect any damage to the blood-brain barrier with either ioxaglate or saline control studies (P greater than 0.1). However, in the rabbit/pertechnetate model a slight increase in disruption of the blood-brain barrier was observed with ioxaglate compared with control studies, but this was only significant at the 0.1 level. The results suggest that the rabbit/pertechnetate model is a more sensitive measure of blood-brain barrier disruption than the canine/CT model. This study also demonstrates that blood-brain barrier disruption following intracarotid injection of ioxaglate is minimal.",

The anesthetized animals (n = 12) per test solution) each received 1.5 mL of contrast material, delivered at a rate of 3 mL/minute. Both contrast media caused major ECG changes, which were reversible within seconds after administration. No fibrillation occurred with ioxaglate, but ventricular fibrillation was seen in seven animals given iohexol. There was a significant difference in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation between the contrast media (P less than .01). Both test solutions induced transient, more or less marked bradycardia, but without significant differences. The intracoronary injections produced similar decreases in blood pressure for both contrast agents. Reactive hypertension was observed only in those animals in which an episode of fibrillation occurred with iohexol. ...",

Renal failure has been reported in patients with liver dysfunction who were given an oral cholecystographic agent followed by an intravascular iodinated radiopaque agent and also in patients with occult renal disease, notably diabetics and hypertensives. In these classes of patients there should be no fluid restriction and every attempt made to maintain normal hydration, prior to contrast medium administration, since dehydration is the single most important factor influencing further renal impairment."

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1,8X10-39 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ioxaglate will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase ioxaglate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Ioxaglate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ioxaglate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. The estimated pKa of ioxaglate is 0.99, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Ioxaglate may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Iodinated X-ray contrast agents are considered non-biodegradable by microorganisms. If released into water, ioxaglate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The estimated pKa indicates ioxaglate will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to ioxaglate may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ioxaglate is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ioxaglate via dermal contact with watercontaining this compound. Exposure to ioxaglate among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

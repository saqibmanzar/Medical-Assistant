When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 108 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-bromo-1-propyne will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-bromo-1-propyne will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 days. 3-Bromo-1-propyne does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-bromo-1-propyne is expected to have very high mobility based upon Koc values of 1.1 and 5.3. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.13X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 3-Bromo-1-propyne may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation in soil is not expected to compete with chemical degradation processes based on similar half-lives in sterile soil (0.37-11 days) and nonsterile soil (0.046-12 days). It has been proposed that the alkylation of soil organic matter is the primary degradation process for 3-bromo-1-propyne in soil. If released into water, 3-bromo-1-propyne is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. No biodegradation data for water systems were available. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 3-Bromo-1-propyne is expected to undergo hydrolysis based on measured half-lives of 64 and 47 days at 22 and 25 \u00b0C, respectively. Occupational exposure to 3-bromo-1-propyne may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-bromo-1-propyne is produced or used. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from a water solubility of 1.49X10+4 mg/L(2) and a regression-derived equation(5), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 3-Bromo-1-propyne is expected to undergo hydrolysis based on measured half-lives of 64 and 47 days at 22 and 25 \u00b0C, respectively(2,6).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

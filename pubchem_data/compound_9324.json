Chlormadinone acetate (CMA) is a potent progesterone receptor (PR) agonist, a partial androgen receptor (AR) antagonist and a weak glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist. Chlormadinone binds to PRs, which induces the expression of progesterone-responsive genes. In addition, chlormadinone blocks ARs in target organs and reduces the activity of skin 5 alpha-reductase; thus inhibiting androgen production and signaling. Through the negative feedback action on the hypothalamus-pituitary system, chlormadinone also suppresses gonadotropin secretion, which prevents ovarian and adrenal androgen production. Therefore, this agent decreases endometrial thickness, increases the viscosity of cervical mucus, inhibits ovulation and suppresses follicular growth and maturation.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Plasma was extracted with acetone:MeOH for total radioactivity; then extracted with water and ether for free steroid radioactivity; then with n-butanol for conjugated steroid radioactivity; and finally extracted with chloroform:MeOH and chromatographed on thin layer with ether:benzene for specific radioactivity due to chlormadinone acetate.

The metabolic clearance rate was 42.61 liters per day...

Single and multiple doses of CMA (2 mg) and ethinylestradiol (EE; 0.03 mg) were administered to healthy female volunteers for six menstrual cycles. Plasma concentrations of CMA and EE were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. In a separate study, healthy female volunteers were given a single 2-mg dose of radiolabeled CMA. Concentrations of radioactivity in fecal and urine samples were determined via liquid scintillation. Excretion of total radioactivity was calculated as percentage of administered dose. Eighteen women completed the repeated-dose study. Peak plasma concentrations for CMA and EE were reached within 1 and 2 hr after taking the study drug. Peak plasma concentrations of CMA were approximately 1600 pg/mL after single-dose administration and 2000 pg/mL after multiple dosing. CMA and EE showed linear pharmacokinetics throughout six cycles, with constant trough values of approximately 400-500 pg/mL for CMA and 20-40 pg/mL for EE. Mass balance factors were 1.2-1.4 for CMA and 1.6-1.7 for EE, and accumulation factors were 1.7-2 for CMA and 1.7-1.8 for EE. Mean t(1/2,z) of CMA was approximately 25 hr after single dosing and 36-39 hr at steady state. In the excretion balance study, mean dose of CMA recovered was 87.3+/-6.4%, with urinary and fecal excretion accounting for 45% and 42%, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of CMA and EE is linear after multiple dosing and remains stable during long-term administration, once steady state is reached. The t(1/2,z) of CMA was 36-39 hr after multiple dosing, which is considerably shorter than the 80 hr often quoted in the literature.",

The study was performed according to a single-center, randomised, single-dose, 2-way cross-over design with a wash-out phase of 28 days. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic profiling were taken up to 168 hr post-dose, and ethinylestradiol and chlormadinone acetate plasma concentrations were determined with a validated LC-MS/MS method. The observed mean maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of ethinylestradiol were 124.96 pg/mL (test) and 129.12 pg/mL (reference). In the case of chlormadinone acetate, Cmax averaged 6.9566 ng/mL (test) and 6.6663 ng/mL (reference). The geometric means of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of ethinylestradiol were 1292.35 pg/mL x hr (test) and 1380.49 pg/mL x hr (reference). For chlormadinone acetate, geometric means of AUC(0-infinity) were 53.322 ng/mL x hr (test) and 58.111 ng/mL x hr (reference). The median of tmax of ethinylestradiol was 1.5 hr for both test and reference and the median of tmax of chlormadinone acetate 1.0 hr (test) and 1.5 hr (reference). Plasma elimination half-lives (t1/2) of ethinylestradiol were 14.96 hr (test) and 15.41 hr (reference) and of chlormadinone acetate 56.63 hr (test) and 56.17 hr (reference), respectively. Both primary target parameters AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax were tested parametrically by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The point estimator and the 90% confidence intervals for the AUC(0-infinity) ratio (test/reference: 93.72% [86.62%-101.39%]) indicate high similarity of both formulations with respect to the extent of ethinylestradiol exposure. A high degree of similarity was also observed for Cmax of ethinylestradiol, as the point estimator and the 90% confidence interval for the Cmax ratio are 96.18% (90.82%-101.86%). Regarding the AUC(0-infinity) ratio of chlormadinone acetate, the point estimator is 91.60% and the 90% confidence interval 84.08%-99.79%. Furthermore, exchangeability of both formulations is also suggested by the point estimator and 90% confidence of Cmax of this active agent (104.72% [95.76%-114.53%]). Bioequivalence between test and reference formulation was demonstrated since for both ethinylestradiol and chlormadinone acetate all 90% confidence intervals of AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax fall into the generally accepted range of 80%-125%.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It has an anti-estrogenic effect and, in contrast to natural progesterone, shows moderate anti-androgenic properties. CMA acts by blocking androgen receptors in target organs and by reducing the activity of skin 5alpha-reductase. It suppresses gonadotropin secretion and thereby reduces ovarian and adrenal androgen production. CMA shows high contraceptive efficacy by inhibiting ovulation due to its ability to suppress or disrupt endogenous gonadotropin secretion and, by this, inhibits follicular growth and maturation. In addition, it suppresses endometrial thickness and increases the viscosity of cervical mucus. ...",

Chlormadinone acetate pre-treatment did not significantly reduce the proportion of rabbits ovulating in response to electrical stimulation. However, there was a significant reduction in the average number of ruptured follicles when compared with the animals in the control group. Chlormadinone acetate pre-treatment significantly reduced the proportion of animals ovulating in response to the intrapituitary infusion of median eminence extract as compared with the control series. However, there was no significant reduction in the average number of ruptured follicles (in those rabbits that ovulated) when compared with the control groups. Chlormadinone acetate pre-treatment produced no significant effect upon either the proportion of animals ovulating, or the average number of ruptured follicles, following i.v. injection of 50 ug LH.5. The conclusion drawn is that chlormadinone acetate blocks copulattion-induced ovulation in the rabbit by action at a site in the central nervous system located above the median eminence. The possible effects of chlormadinone acetate upon the secretion of FSH, the pituitary sensitivity to releasing factors and the ovarian sensitivity to LH are discussed.",

Controls received the vehicle, 1% gelatine in 0.9% saline... Dihydrotestosterone was injected at a dose of 150 ug twice daily for 14 days as a positive control. All animals were killed on the morning after the last day of treatment, and the ventral prostate and adrenals were removed and weighted; furthermore, the prostatic content of ornithine decarboxylase was measured, as it is consider to be a highly specific, sensitive of androgenic activity in the prostate. Dihydrotestosterone increased the ventral prostate weight to 43% above that of castrated controls. Chlormadinone acetate was less potent than dihydrotestosterone but caused significant increases in prostate weight, by about 22% at 3 mg and 36% at 10 mg per injection. Whereas dihydrotestosterone caused a 14-fold increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity in the prostate, chlormadinone acetate caused a 5.3-fold increase at 3 mg and an 11.8-fold increase at 10 mg. Chlormadinone acetate thus has weak but significant androgenic activity in the rat ventral prostate.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

Drug-induced pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare secondary form of PRCA, and is usually acute and fully reversible by the withdrawal of the causative drugs.

This case demonstrated that these drugs could be a cause of PRCA, and suggests that regular close monitoring for anemia is needed in prostate cancer patients treated with these drugs.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.2X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chlormadinone acetate will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase chlormadinone acetate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Chlormadinone acetate absorbs light at wavelengths of 283.5 and 286 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, chlormadinone acetate is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 7,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.6X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, chlormadinone acetate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 170 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process given estimated half-lives of 2.3 years and 84 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to chlormadinone acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chlormadinone acetate is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to chlormadinone acetate via dermal contact with contaminated water. Exposure to chlormadinone acetate among the general population will also occur to those administered the drug, a progestogen. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

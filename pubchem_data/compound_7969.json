When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The prodrug is stored as a protein-bound chromophore that contains an enediyne nucleus. A thiolate attack on the chromophore cyclizes the nucleus and produces radicals that abstract hydrogen from DNA. Because thiol is the only cofactor in the vital activation process, the structure of the thiol plays an important role in the activity of the drug. Here we systematically examine the effect of the electronic structure of some thiols on the efficiency of the drug, and compare particularly aromatic with aliphatic thiols. The values of drug-induced base release from DNA are remarkably different between thiophenol (3.6%) and benzyl mercaptan (12.5%), the activity of which is comparable with those of aliphatic thiols. Cleavage results determined by DNA electrophoresis are consistent with the results of base release; they show that the total number of DNA lesions is more than 3-fold lower for thiophenol than for aliphatic thiols or benzyl mercaptan. We conclude that among aromatic thiols, only those that have delocalized thiol sulfur electrons can substantially reduce the DNA cleavage activity. This result suggests that the effect of an aromatic ring arises from an inductive effect imposed on the thiol sulfur electron through pi-resonance rather than through effects such as aromatic stacking, steric hindrance, or hydrophobic interaction. Replacing thiophenol with substituted derivatives with electron-releasing or -withdrawing groups changes the drug activity and supports the important role of the electronic structure of the thiol sulfur in determining the drug activity.",

Reduction of corresponding disulfides by intracellular glutathione caused cyclic reduction/oxidation reactions, resulting in increased oxidative flux. Three levels of oxidative stress were observed in these experiments; the lowest level resulted from incubation with 0.25 mM thiophenol; the intermediate level with 0.50 mM thiophenol or 0.25 mM 4-aminothiophenol; the highest levels with 0.50 mM 4-aminothiophenol. Methemoglobin formation increased with increasing level of oxidative stress. Glycolysis and the hexose monophosphate shunt were inhibited at the intermediate and highest levels of stress, respectively. Above the highest level of stress non-intact hemoglobin was formed and cell lysis occurred. These metabolic responses were reflected in cellular levels of NADH, NADPH and reduced glutathione. At the lowest level of oxidative stress, both glycolysis and hexose monophosphate shunt were increased such that near-normal levels of NADH, NADPH and reduced glutathione were maintained and methemglobin formation was kept to a minimum. The response of red cells to 0.25 mM thiophenol appears to represent a level of oxidative stress to which the cell is capable of adaptive metabolic response. Glycolysis contributes approximately one quarter of the total reducing equivalents from glucose metabolism in response to the oxidative challenge by thiophenol.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this clear-to-white, garlic-smelling liquid may occur from its manufacture and use as a chemical intermediate for insecticides, acaricides, fungicides, pharmaceuticals, and polymers. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, headaches, eye changes, and methemoglobin formation. OSHA has set a time-weighted average (TWA) limit of 0.5 ppm, as a final rule to become effective December 31, 1992.  Local exhaust ventilation should be used to control thiophenol in workplace air. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and chemical protective clothing which is specifically recommended by the shipperor producer. If contact should occur, irrigate eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. Contaminated clothing and shoes should be removed and left at the site. Thiophenol may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames, and may form explosive concentrations in confined spaces such as sewers.  For fires involving thiophenol, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or regular foam.  Fight such fires from a maximum distance and dike fire control water for later disposal.  Thiophenol may be transported domestically via air, rail, road, and water, in containers bearing the label, \"Poison.\" For small spills of thiophenol, take up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and place into containers for later disposal.  Large spills should be diked far ahead for later disposal.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

It is primarily used as a mosquito larvicide and chemical intermediate for pesticides, pharmaceuticals and amber dyes.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Thiophenols causes conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin in human red blood cells and dose-dependent oxidative stress.  ANIMAL STUDIES: Application of a drop to rabbit eyes caused severe irritation, moderate redness, chemosis of the conjunctiva with discharge for 3-4 days. Corneas developed opacities which gradually increased during 2-3 wk, becoming opalescent and obscuring details of pupil and iris. However, in 2 months the eyes recovered. Thiophenol administration in rats during gestation increased postimplantation loss, decreased the live litter size, decreased fetal body weight/litter, and  increased the incidence of external malformations in the high dose group. In summary, maternal toxicity, observed as maternal mortality, a persistent decrease in body weight and weight gain, and decreased in food consumption during the treatment period occurred at the high dose level of 50 mg/kg/day. Rooting behavior was observed in all thiophenol groups during the dosing period indicating an aversion to the dosing formulation. Rooting behavior showed a dose-related increase and an earlier onset with increasing dose. The lowest observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) was 20 mg/kg/day for maternal toxicity based upon minor, transient decreases in maternal weight gain & food consumption on gestation day 6-9.  In another experiment in Sprague Dawley rats, F0 and F1 liver and kidney weights increased with increasing dose of thiophenol and were associated with centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy and renal tubule degeneration. Decreased (5-6%) sperm motility was observed in Sprague Dawley F0 rats administered 18 and 35 mg/kg. Inhibited spermiation was observed in all treated F1 males but not the F0 males. In developmental study in rabbits NOAEL for developmental toxicity was > or = 40 mg/kg/day; The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 10 mg/kg/day. Thiophenol, in Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA100 and TA98, showed relative mutagenic response with and without metabolic activation.",

Thiophenols caused conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin. Reduction of corresponding disulfides by intracellular glutathione caused cyclic reduction/oxidation reactions, resulting in increased oxidative flux. Three levels of oxidative stress were observed in these experiments; the lowest level resulted from incubation with 0.25 mM thiophenol; the intermediate level with 0.50 mM thiophenol or 0.25 mM 4-aminothiophenol; the highest levels with 0.50 mM 4-aminothiophenol. Methemoglobin formation increased with increasing level of oxidative stress. Glycolysis and the hexose monophosphate shunt were inhibited at the intermediate and highest levels of stress, respectively. Above the highest level of stress non-intact hemoglobin was formed and cell lysis occurred. These metabolic responses were reflected in cellular levels of NADH, NADPH and reduced glutathione. At the lowest level of oxidative stress, both glycolysis and hexose monophosphate shunt were increased such that near-normal levels of NADH, NADPH and reduced glutathione were maintained and methemglobin formation was kept to a minimum. The response of red cells to 0.25 mM thiophenol appears to represent a level of oxidative stress to which the cell is capable of adaptive metabolic response. Glycolysis contributes approximately one quarter of the total reducing equivalents from glucose metabolism in response to the oxidative challenge by thiophenol.",

Thiophenol was nominated for testing due to the relative lack of reproductive toxicity information; it is used as a chemical intermediate and mosquito larvicide. Thiophenol in corn oil was administered by oral gavage at doses of 9, 18, and 35 mg/kg/day to 20 animals/sex/group. Rats were individually housed for one week and then cohabitated for 16 weeks. During cohabitation, litters were euthanized after evaluation on postnatal day (PND) 1. Litters born after Week 17 were reared until PND 21 and selected weanlings were administered the same dose levels as their respective parents. On PND 81 +/- 10, F1 animals were cohabitated within groups for one week and necropsied following delivery of the litters. During 16 weeks of cohabitation, adjusted live pup weight was decreased by 4 and 6% in the 9 and 35 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. At the crossover mating trial to determine the affected sex, the pups born to 35 mg/kg females weighed 8-9% less; no effects were observed in litters from thiophenol-treated males. In the F1 mating trial, live F2 pup weight was decreased by 9 and 12% in the 18 and 35 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. Throughout the study, the body weights of the F0 and F1 35 mg/kg males were consistently decreased. F0 and F1 liver and kidney weights increased with increasing dose and were associated with centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy and renal tubule degeneration. Decreased (5-6%) sperm motility was observed in the 18 and 35 mg/kg F0 group. Inhibited spermiation was observed in all treated F1 males but not the F0 males. In conclusion, thiophenol is not a selective reproductive toxicant, because the effects on male (decreased sperm motility and inhibited spermiation) and female (decreased live pup weight during the crossover mating) endpoints occurred concomitant with, or at doses greater than, those that produced hepatic or renal effects.",

Based on acute oral LD50 of 46.2 mg/kg & the increased mortality in the 40 mg/kg/day females & the increased liver weights at 30 mg/kg/day noted during a previous RACB study with thiophenol, dose levels for the continuous breeding phase for this study were set at 9, 18, & 35 mg/kg. Male & female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to thiophenol in corn oil by oral gavage. During 16 wks of cohabitation, live pup weight adjusted for litter size was decreased by 4 & 6% in the 9 & 35 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. The number of live pups was slightly but not significantly decreased (7%) at 35 mg/kg. No differences were observed in the pregnancy index, cumulative days to litter, mean avg litters/pair, proportion of pups born alive, or sex ratio of pups. A crossover mating trial (Task 3) revealed the females as the affected sex. When naive males were mated with control or 35 mg/kg females, the mean live pup weight & adjusted live pup weight were reduced in the 35 mg/kg group by 8-9%. No other treatment-related effects were seen. When naive females were mated with control or 35 mg/kg males, reproductive parameters were comparable between dose groups. Throughout the study, the body weights of the F0 35 mg/kg males were 7-15% less than controls. F0 female body weights were not adversely effected by thiophenol. At necropsy, liver & kidney weights increased with increasing dose: liver weights (relative to body weight) of the 9, 18, & 35 mg/kg animals were increased by 20, 35, & 50% (males) & 11, 18, 36% (females), respectively. Relative kidney weights of the 9, 18, & 35 mg/kg animals were increased by 30, 53, & 104% (males) & 8, 5, 20% (females), respectively. There was a treatment-related incr in the incidence of enlarged & pitted kidneys in the F0 males at necropsy. Increased incidences of renal tubule degeneration (30%, 35%, & 40%, respectively) were observed in 9, 18, & 35 mg/kg F0 males & females. Centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed in the 18 & 35 mg/kg F0 males & 9, 18, & 35 mg/kg F0 females. Evaluation of epididymal computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) data revealed treatment-related decreases (5-6%) in percent motile sperm in the 18 & 35 mg/kg groups compared to controls. Other reproductive endpoints at necropsy were comparable among dose groups. In Task 4 (second generation evaluation), the pup weights of the 35 mg/kg F1 males & females were decreased by 13-16% during Postnatal Day (PND) 4 & 7 of lactation; however, no differences were observed on /postnatal day/ 1, 14 or 21. There was no treatment-related incr in pre-weaning mortality of the F1 animals. In the F1 mating trial, live F2 pup weight was decreased by 9 & 12% in the 18 & 35 mg/kg dose groups, respectively, when compared to controls. Other endpoints were unchanged. Body weights of the 35 mg/kg F1 males were 11-17% less than controls on Task Weeks 2 & 4, & at delivery & necropsy. At necropsy, the liver & kidneys were also enlarged in a treatment-related fashion for both sexes in the F1 animals: relative liver weights of the 9, 18, & 35 mg/kg animals were increased by 18, 37, & 62% (males) & 14, 17, 43% (females), respectively. Relative kidney weights of the 9, 18, & 35 mg/kg animals were increased by 52, 67, & 163% (males) & 12, 6, 26% (females), respectively. There was a treatment-related incr in the incidence of enlarged, pale, & soft kidneys in the F1 males at necropsy. As observed in the F0 animals, renal tubule degeneration was observed in 9, 18, & 35 mg/kg F1 males & 18 & 35 mg/kg F1 females. Centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed in the 9, 18, & 35 mg/kg F1 males & females. Microscopic evaluation of the left testis from F1 males revealed a treatment-related incr in inhibited spermiation of the stage VIII-X tubules. No F1 sperm endpoints were significantly changed. Results of this study show that thiophenol is not a selective reproductive toxicant, because the minor effects on development (decreased live pup weight during the crossover mating) occurred concomitant with, or at doses greater than, those doses that produce hepatic or renal effects. The no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was not established in this study as the 9 mg/kg animals displayed increased liver & kidney weights (absolute & relative) & treatment-related microscopic lesions. A max tolerated dose (MTD) was reached for the 35 mg/kg F0 & F1 generation animals, based on decreased body weights (males only), increased liver & kidney weights, & treatment-related renal & hepatic lesions.",

THIO ... was administered by gavage in corn oil to mated CD rats (25/group) on gestation days (gd) 6-15 at levels of 0, 20, 35, or 50 mg/kg/day. Animals were observed daily for clinical signs of toxicity. Body weight was recorded on the mornings of /gestation day/ 0, 3, 6-15, 18 & 20. Food & water weights were recorded for the animals in each group on /gestation day/ 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, & 20. All animals in the developmental toxicity study were killed on /gestation day/ 20 & examined for maternal body & organ weights, implant status, fetal weight, sex, & morphological development. Four animals in the high dose group died or were sacrificed in extremis. For animals surviving to scheduled necropsy on /gestation day/ 20, pregnancy rates were 100%, 100%, 96% & 100% in the control through high exposure groups, respectively. Clinical signs consisted primarily of rooting behavior after gavage admin of THIO. The incidence of rooting behavior increased with increasing dose, & also with time across the dosing period. Thus, rooting was first noted on /gestation day/ 11 (low dose), /gestation day/ 8 (mid dose) & /gestation day/ 6 (high dose), reaching a max incidence of 0% (control), 28% (low dose), 92% (mid dose) & 100% (high dose) by /gestation day/ 15. This behavior was not observed after the treatment period was concluded. Maternal body weight was significantly depressed in the high dose group from /gestation day/ 9 to termination on /gestation day/ 20. Maternal body weight change was depressed in all treatment groups for the period of /gestation day/ 6-9, & in the high dose group for /gestation day/ 9-12, during the treatment & total gestational periods, & for corrected maternal weight gain. Maternal food consumption (g/kg/day) was decreased in all treated groups for /gestation day/ 6-9, & in the high dose group on /gestation day/ 9-12, & the treatment period (/gestation day/ 6-15). Relative maternal food consumption increased in the high dose group during the post-treatment period (/gestation day/ 15-18, 18-20, & 15-20). Maternal water consumption (g/kg/day) was higher in the high dose group compared to the control group on /gestation day/ 6-9, 9-12, 12-15, 15-18, 18-20, during the treatment period (/gestation day/ 6-15), & the post-treatment period (/gestation day/ 15-20). Necropsy of the maternal animals revealed increased relative (% body weight) & adjusted (for maternal weight) liver weight in the high dose group, but no change in right kidney weight. Gravid uterine weight was decreased at the high dose. THIO admin during gestation increased postimplantation loss, decreased the live litter size, decreased fetal body weight/litter, & increased the incidence of external malformations in the high dose group. In summary, maternal toxicity, observed as maternal mortality, a persistent decr in body weight & weight gain, & decr in food consumption during the treatment period occurred at the high dose level of 50 mg/kg/day. Rooting behavior was observed in all THIO groups during the dosing period indicating an aversion to the dosing formulation. Rooting behavior showed a dose-related incr & an earlier onset with increasing dose. The lowest observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) was 20 mg/kg/day for maternal toxicity based upon minor, transient decreases in maternal weight gain & food consumption on /gestation day/ 6-9. The maternal NOAEL could not be determined based upon the doses evaluated in this study. Developmental toxicity, observed as increased postimplantation death, decreased litter size, decreased fetal body weight, & an incr in the incidence of external malformations occurred at the high dose. Reduced female fetal body weight was observed at 35 mg/kg/day, suggesting a NOAEL for developmental toxicity of 20 mg/kg/day.",

THIO ... was administered by gavage in corn oil to artificially inseminated New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits on gestation days (gd) 6-19 at levels of 0, 10, 30, or 40 mg/kg/day during the period of major organogenesis. A slightly higher dose (50 mg/kg/day) was excluded from the final study design due to excessive maternal toxicity. Maternal clinical signs, body weight, & food consumption were monitored at regular intervals from /gestation day/ 0-30. On /gestation day/ 30, fetuses were removed from the does & examined for evidence of THIO-induced developmental toxicity. Two does died during the study, one each in the 10 & 30 mg/kg/day groups. No consistent clinical signs were observed during the course of the study. Maternal relative food consumption during the end of the dosing period tended to be lower in the 30 & 40 mg/kg/day groups, but overall food consumption during & after the dosing period was comparable to controls in all THIO groups. Maternal body weight gain displayed transient decreases which were confined to /gestation day/ 12-15 within the dosing period & limited to the 30 & 40 mg/kg/day groups. Overall maternal body weight gain during the dosing period (/gestation day/ 6-19) tended to be lower in the THIO-treated does, but maternal body weights in the THIO groups were comparable to control values at all gestational ages. Necropsy of the maternal animals on GD 30 indicated no THIO-related effects on gravid uterine weight or absolute or relative (% body weight) liver or right kidney weights. The number of implantation sites/litter & the % preimplantation loss/litter was comparable in all groups. THIO admin did not adversely affect average live litter size, sex ratio, or avg fetal body weight/litter. Morphological evaluation of the fetuses showed no THIO-related increases in the incidence of malformations (external, visceral, or skeletal) or variations. In summary, 40 mg/kg/day THIO did not adversely affect the growth, viability, or morphological development of the offspring. Thus, the NOAEL for developmental toxicity in this study was > or = 40 mg/kg/day; the LOAEL could not be determined at the doses evaluated in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 10 mg/kg/day. Toxic effects at 30 & 40 mg/kg/day were minor & transient so that the evidence of toxicity was equivocal. However, a slightly higher dose (50 mg/kg/day) was found to be excessively toxic resulting in maternal morbidity & mortality. Thus, the dose-range evaluated in this study was appropriately selected, & evaluation of developmental toxicity at doses above 40 mg/kg/day was precluded by excessive maternal toxicity.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.93 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates thiophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase thiophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 34 hours. Thiophenol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, thiophenol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 230. The pKa of thiophenol is 6.62, indicating that this compound will exist partially in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral form from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.35X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization of the anionic form from moist soil is not expected because anions do not volatilize. The neutral form of thiophenol may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks. However, in water, using an activated sludge inocula, thiophenol reached 30-42% of its theoretical BOD in 6 days. These studies indicate that biodegradation may or may not be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, thiophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected for the anionic form, but is expected for the neutral form of thiophenol based upon the estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 20 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to thiophenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where thiophenol is produced or used. (SRC)",

The pKa of thiophenol is 6.62(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially as an anion in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Volatilization of the anion form of thiophenol from moist soil surfaces is not expected because anions do not volatilize(SRC). Volatilization of the neutral form of thiophenol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.35X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure, 1.93 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 835 mg/L(6). Thiophenol in its neutral form is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(5). Thiophenol, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(7). However, in water, using an activated sludge inocula, thiophenol reached 30-42% of its theoretical BOD in 6 days(8). These studies suggest that biodegradation in soil may or may not be an important fate process(SRC).",

A pKa of 6.62(3) indicates thiophenol will exist partially in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization of the anion form from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). Volatilization of the neutral form from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.35X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 1.93 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 835 mg/L(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for the neutral form for a model river and model lake are 6 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). Thiophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 20(SRC), from its log Kow of 2.52(8) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Thiophenol, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(9). However, in water, using an activated sludge inocula, thiophenol reached 30-42% of its theoretical BOD in 6 days(10). These studies suggest that biodegradation in aquatic systems may or may not be an important fate process(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

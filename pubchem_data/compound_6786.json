They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Those tested were dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, diisobutyl, dihexyl, di(2-ethylhexyl), diisodecyl, and benzyl butyl phthalate. Hair from a skin area (1.3 cm in diameter) on the back of male F344 rats was clipped, the 14(C)phthalate diester was applied in a dose of 157 mumol/kg, and the area of application was covered with a perforated cap. The rat was restrained and housed for 7 days in a metabolic cage that allowed separate collection of urine and feces. Urine and feces were collected every 24 hr, and the amount of (14)C excreted was taken as an index of the percutaneous absorption. At 24 hr, diethyl phthalate showed the greatest excretion (26%). As the length of the alkyl side chain increased, the amount of (14)C excreted in the first 24 hr decreased signficantly. The cumulative percentage dose excreted in 7 days was greatest for diethyl, dibutyl, and diisobutyl phthalate, about 50-60% of the applied (14)C; and intermediate (20-40%) for dimethyl, benzyl butyl, and dihexyl phthalate. Urine was the major route of excretion of all phthalate diesters except for diisodecyl phthalate. This compound was poorly absorbed and showed almost no urinary excretion. After 7 days, the percentage dose for each phthalate that remained in the body was minimal showed no specific tissue distribution. Most of the unexcreted dose remained in the area of application. These data show that the structure of the phthalate diester determines the degree of dermal absorption. Absorption maximized with diethyl phthalate and then decreased significantly as the alkyl side chain length increased.",

As the two bacteria grew on di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate , they excreted products that increased the solubility of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and diisoctyl, dihexyl, and diisodecyl but not butyl benzyl or di-n-butyl phthalates. The solubilizer was produced by Mycobacterium sp even when grown on a water soluble substrate such as acetate. Addition of the solubilizer to culture media enhanced the degradation of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and diisooctyl phthalate by Mycobacterium sp and Nocardia sp but not butyl benzyl phthalate. The extent of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate degradation by Mycobacterium sp in media amended with the solubilizer was reduced and the initiation of degradation was delayed if the solubilizer was first treated with protease. The effect of protease was not a result of its toxicity to Mycobacterium or use of the enzyme preparation for growth of the organism. The results thus show that microbial products increase the solubility of certain phthalates and enhance their degradation.",

The former induce liver enlargement and proliferation of hepatic peroxisomes, while the latter cause no peroxisome proliferation but cause fat accumulation in the liver. Both classes of phthalate esters are hypolipidaemic and cause thyroid changes associated with an increased rate of thyroglobulin turnover. As phthalate esters are used as mixtures, ... the effect of mixtures of the compounds /were examined/. Groups of five male Wistar albino rats were administered either control diet or diets containing either 10,000 ppm of DEHP, 10,000 ppm of DnHP or 10,000 ppm DEHP plus 10,000 ppm DnHP for 14 days. Rats receiving diets containing DEHP showed the expected increase in relative liver weight, in \"peroxisomal\" fatty acid oxidation and in CYP4A1. Serum triglyceride and serum cholesterol were also reduced, and the thyroid showed the histological changes mentioned above. Rats consuming diets containing DnHP showed no increase in relative liver weight and no induction of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation or CYP4A1. However, there was a marked accumulation of fat in the liver. The fall in serum cholesterol was similar to that in rats treated with DEHP, but the fall of serum triglyceride was more pronounced. Thyroidal changes were again observed. In general, changes in rats treated with a mixture of DEHP and DnHP were very similar to those found with rats treated with DEHP alone. The liver was enlarged, and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and CYP4A1 were both induced. The amount of fat in the liver was much less than in rats receiving DnHP alone. Thyroid changes were similar to those in rats receiving the individual compounds. The effect on serum cholesterol seemed additive, but the levels of serum triglyceride were intermediate between the groups receiving the single compounds.",

This study ... investigated the effects of eight phthalates on the calcium signaling of human nAChR by using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. All eight phthalates, with different potency, have inhibitory roles on the calcium signaling coupled with human nAChR, but not muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). For inhibition of human nAChR, the strongest to weakest potencies were observed as di-n-pentyl phthalate (DPP) --> butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) --> di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) --> dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) --> di-n-hexyl phthalate (DHP) --> di-(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP) --> di-n-propyl phthalate (DPrP) --> diethyl phthalate (DEP). The potencies of phthalates were associated with their structures such that the most effective ones had dialkyl group carbon numbers of C4 or C5, with shorter or longer numbers resulting in decreased potency. At as low as 0.1 uM, DPP, DBP, BBP, DCHP and DHP significantly inhibited the calcium signaling of human nAChR. The IC50 of phthalates on human nAChR, ranging from 0.32 to 7.96 uM, were 10-50 lower than those for bovine nAChR. ...",

The effects were compared to those produced by approximately equal concentrations of DnOP, another straight-chain phthalate, and DEHP, a branched-chain phthalate. A group of 12 male rats was fed a diet containing 20,000 ppm DnHP and a control group of 18 rats was fed the basal diet. Using actual food intake levels and rat body weights on the day of sacrifice, a DnHP dose of 1,824 mg/kg bw/day was calculated. Groups of 4 treated rats and 6 control rats were sacrificed and necropsied after 3, 10, or 21 days of treatment. ... DnHP treatment did not cause a change in body weight gain or food intake levels. DnHP treatment had no effect on testes weight or the gross appearance of testes, kidney, or pancreas. However, liver weight was significantly increased following 21 days of DnHP treatment, with histology and chemistry changes observed at all 3 assessment times. Centrilobular necrosis and loss of glycogen were first observed at 3 days and centrilobular fatty accumulation was observed at 10 days of treatment. The effects became more pronounced with increasing duration of treatment. Examination by electron microscopy revealed proliferation and dilation of smooth endoplasmic reticuli and shortening of the microvilli in bile canaliculi at 3 days, the presence of lipid droplets within hepatocytes at 10 days, and possibly a small increase in lysosomes and peroxisomes at 3 and 21 days, respectively. The activity of the peroxisomal proliferation marker, cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl CoA oxidase, was significantly increased at levels approximately 2-fold greater than controls in rats only after 10 days of treatment. There was no change in total catalase activity, but catalase activity in the particulate fraction was significantly increased at 10 and 21 days of treatment. A significant decrease in glucose-6-phosphate activity at 21 days of treatment was the only other effect on liver enzymes. Effects of DnOP, DnHP, and DEHP on thyroid were studied in rats. Each phthalate was associated with a decrease in serum thyroxine (T4) levels. ... Electron microscopic changes indicative of thyroid hyperactivity (increased lysosomal numbers and size, enlarged Golgi apparatus, and mitochondrial damage) were also observed. In a comparison of the three tested phthalates, the effects induced by DnHP were similar to DnOP, but different from DEHP. DEHP treatment resulted in a more pronounced increase in liver weight and in increased mitotic activity. Less fat accumulated following treatment with DEHP, and when observed, the accumulation occurred in the midzonal and periportal zones rather than in the centrilobular region. Biochemical evidence of peroxisome proliferation (cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl CoA oxidation) occurred earlier with DEHP treatment (after 3 days of treatment) and was approximately 7-fold higher than it was following DnHP or DnOP treatment. Although DEHP was a stronger inducer of peroxisome proliferation, DnHP and DnOP also induced peroxisome proliferation following longer treatment periods. ... Thyroid effects were similar for all three phthalates.",

Data on food & water consumptions, body weights, & clinical signs collected in the Task 1 dose-range-finding study, were used to set doses for the continuous breeding part of the study at 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, & 1.2% in feed. Food consumption was not altered by the presence of DHP. These concns yielded calculated consumption estimates of nearly equal to 0.38, 0.80, & 1.67 g DHP/kg/day. In the continuous breeding phase, there were no live pups at the high dose & 1 litter of 4 pups at the middle dose. At the low dose, there was a significant reduction in the mean number of litters/pair (3.4, vs. 4.9 for the controls). Also at the low dose, the number of live pups/litter was reduced from 12.3 (controls) to 3.4, the proportion born alive was reduced by 14%. Pup weight adjusted for litter size was unchanged. These effects occurred in the absence of an effect on post-partum dam body weights. These significant reproductive effects prompted the determination of the affected sex in the Task 3 crossover mating trial using the control & 1.2% DHP-treated mice. Each group had 17-20 pairs of mice. The mating index (proportion of pairs showing copulatory plugs) in groups with 2 control partners, with a DHP-treated male, or a DHP-treated female, was 90%, 56%, & 88%, showing that the treated females were cycling & could be receptive, & that mating capability was reduced in the group of treated males . However, no treated females bore any litters, & only 1 of 18 treated males sired a litter. Effectively, both sexes were infertile at this level of DHP exposure. After the litters from the crossover were examined & discarded, the F0 adults from the control & 1.2% DHP groups were killed & necropsied. Body weight in the high dose males was 10% less than controls, & absolute testis weight was 70% less. Body-weight-adjusted liver weights were increased by 34%, & adjusted weights of kidney, epididymis, & seminal vesicles were reduced by 9, 23, & 18%, respectively. Body weight of DHP-exposed F0 females was 6% less than controls, while adjusted weights of liver was increased by 32% & adjusted kidney weights were decreased by 6%. Not surprisingly, epididymal sperm concn was reduced by 93%, & motility was reduced by 80%. Morphologic abnormalities were unchanged. There were insufficient animals from any DHP-treated group to provide F1 mice for an evaluation of the second generation. These data clearly demonstrate that DHP is a reproductive toxicant in mice. The relative sensitivity of the liver & the reproductive system cannot be judged from these data, but the reproductive effects occured in the absence of large changes (at the top dose) or any changes (low & middle doses) in body weight.",

It was possible to derive 10-d LC50 (lethal concentration for 50% of the population) values only for the four lower molecular weight esters (DMP, DEP, DBP, and BBP), for which toxicity increased with increasing octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) and decreasing water solubility. ... No significant survival reductions were observed when the three species were exposed to either DHP or DEHP at concentrations approximating their water solubilities.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo effect of ... diethyl phthalate (DEP), dihexyl phthalate (DHP), dipropyl phthalate (DPrP) and diphenyl phthalate (DPP) on the defense system of the giant freshwater prawn, M. rosenbergii. PAE dissolved in corn oil was continuously fed to prawns for 8 days and five immune parameters (total hemocyte count, THC; ratio of granulocytes to hyalinocytes, G/H; intrahemocytic total phenoloxidase activity, PO(T); intracellular superoxide anion (O2-) production; transglutaminase (TGase) activity) were separately detected on days 1, 4 and 8. In addition, mortality was determined on days 4 and 8 after challenging the prawns with Lactobacillus garvieae. ... DHP demonstrated the lowest toxicity in that it only influenced the PO activity and O2- production before 4 days after treatment and caused 6.6% mortality on day 8. DEP decreased G/H, PO(T) and TGase activity on day 1 and reduced THC, G/H and PO(T) and caused 16.6% mortality on day 4; however, on day 8, it increased O2- production and caused no mortality. In the DPrP-treated group, a reduction of all the immune reactions apart from TGase activity and 22.2% mortality were detected on day 4. ... DPP ... decreased all the immune parameters apart from THC on days 1 and 4, but caused no mortality on day 4; but on day 8, an increase of O2- production and 17.7% mortality were detected. These results indicated that the immune reactions of prawns were variable due to the different toxic effects of PAEs. In addition, ... on day 8 after treatment, ... DHP, DPrP and DPP increased O2- production and did not influence the other four reactions, but mortality was detected in these groups.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.4X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dihexyl phthalate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dihexyl phthalate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 26 hours. Particulate-phase dihexyl phthalate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Dihexyl phthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dihexyl phthalate is expected to have no mobility based upon an average Koc of 5.26X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Using an acclimated inoculum of soil, sewage and activated sludge, >99% of dihexyl phthalate was lost and 77% of theoretical carbon dioxide was evolved after 28 days, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil . If released into water, dihexyl phthalate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the average Koc. A 30 to 95% biodegradation in fresh water after a 14 day incubation indicates biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.8 and 26 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 15 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 1,100 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. However, bioconcentration studies on compounds which are structurally similar suggest that  bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated by the regression-derived equations due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds. Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 3.4 years and 130 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively, suggest that hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process. Occupational exposure to dihexyl phthalate may occur through inhalation of aerosols and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dihexyl phthalate is produced or used.  Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dihexyl phthalate via inhalation of ambient air and dust, ingestion drinking water, and dermal contact with products containing dihexyl phthalate.

However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 15 years if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 1,100(SRC), from a log Kow of 6.82(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). However, bioconcentration studies on compounds which are structurally similar suggest that  bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated by the regression-derived equations due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds(10). Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 3.4 years and 130 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively, suggest that hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process(11). In a river die-away test, it took 1 day to achieve 90% degradation(12). An initial concn of dihexyl phthalate of 25 mg/L was degraded 30 to 95% in fresh water after a 14 day incubation(10).",

Vapor-phase dihexyl phthalate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 26 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.5X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase dihexyl phthalate may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). Dihexyl phthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Dihexyl phthalate had a half-life of 2.9 days with a 1.6 day lag(1). Dihexyl phthalate was degraded by activated sludge; although the units of the first order rate constant were omitted(2). In a semi-continuous activated sludge test (Soap and Detergent Association procedure), the mean percentage degradation for dihexyl phthalate was >92.8% in 24 hr(3). In the die-away phase of the testing, it took 1 day to achieve 90% degradation(3). An initial concentration of dihexyl phthalate of 25 mg/L was degraded 30 to 95% in fresh water after a 14 day incubation(4). Dihexyl phthalate at a starting concentration of 35 mg/L was biodegraded 80% after a 28 day incubation at 22 \u00b0C(4). Dihexyl phthalate had an average aerobic biodegradation half-life of 9.7 days calculated in 6 river sediment samples taken from Taiwan rivers(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.

This Henry's Law constant indicates that dihexyl phthalate is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 2.8 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 26 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column.  The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 15 years if adsorption is considered(4). Dihexyl phthalate's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Dihexyl phthalate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

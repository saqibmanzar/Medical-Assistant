When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Here, we examined the hydrolytic metabolism of phenyl and benzyl salicylates by various tissue microsomes and plasma of rats, and by human liver and small-intestinal microsomes. Both salicylates were readily hydrolyzed by tissue microsomes, predominantly in small intestine, followed by liver, although phenyl salicylate was much more rapidly hydrolyzed than benzyl salicylate. The liver and small-intestinal microsomal hydrolase activities were completely inhibited by bis(4-nitrophenyl)phosphate, and could be extracted with Triton X-100. Phenyl salicylate-hydrolyzing activity was co-eluted with carboxylesterase activity by anion exchange column chromatography of the Triton X-100 extracts of liver and small-intestinal microsomes. Expression of rat liver and small-intestinal isoforms of carboxylesterase, Ces1e and Ces2c (AB010632), in COS cells resulted in significant phenyl salicylate-hydrolyzing activities with the same specific activities as those of liver and small-intestinal microsomes, respectively. Human small-intestinal microsomes also exhibited higher hydrolyzing activity than liver microsomes towards these salicylates. Human CES1 and CES2 isozymes expressed in COS cells both readily hydrolyzed phenyl salicylate, but the activity of CES2 was higher than that of CES1. These results indicate that significant amounts of salicylic acid might be formed by microsomal hydrolysis of phenyl and benzyl salicylates in vivo. The possible pharmacological and toxicological effects of salicylic acid released from salicylates present in commercial products should be considered.",

In this work a rapid reliable and specific RP-HPLC method coupled with diode array detector (DAD) has been developed for the simultaneous determination and quantification of the 24 volatile chemicals: amyl cinnamal, benzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, citral, eugenol, hydroxy-citronellal, isoeugenol, amylcinnamyl alcohol, benzyl salicylate, cinnamal, coumarin, geraniol, Lyral (hydroxy-methylpentylcyclohexene carboxaldehyde), anisyl alcohol, benzyl cinnamate, farnesol, Lilial (2-(4-tert-butylbenzyl)propionaldehyde) linalool, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, hexyl cinnamal, limonene, methylheptin carbonate, alpha-isomethyl ionone (3-methyl-4-(2,6,6-trimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-yl)-3-buten-2-one). The 24 analytes were appropriately separated over a running time of 40 min, on a C18 column using a simple gradient elution (acetonitrile/water) with flow rate from 0.7 to 1.0 mL/min and UV acquisition at 210, 254 and 280 nm. All calibration curves showed good linearity (r2>0.99) within test ranges. The method was successfully applied to the qualitative and quantitative determination of the potential allergens in four commercial scented products, with satisfactory accuracy and precision. The results indicated that this simple and efficient method can be used for quality assessment of complex matrices such us cosmetic scented products.",

The list includes benzyl alcohol, limonene, linalool, methyl 2-octynoate, beta-citronellol, geraniol, citral (two isomers), 7-hydroxycitronellal, anisyl alcohol, cinnamal, cinnamyl alcohol, eugenol, isoeugenol (two isomers), coumarin, alpha-isomethyl ionone, lilial, alpha-amylcinnamal, lyral, alpha-amylcinnamyl alcohol, farnesol (three isomers), alpha-hexyl cinnamal, benzyl cinnamate, benzyl benzoate, and benzyl salicylate. The applicability of a headspace (HS) autosampler in combination with a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a programmable temperature vaporizer (PTV) and a quadrupole mass spectrometry (qMS) detector is explored. By using a headspace sampler, sample preparation is reduced to introducing the sample into the vial. This reduces the analysis time and the experimental errors associated with this step of the analytical process. Two different injection techniques were used: solvent-vent injection and hot-split injection. The first offers a way to improve sensitivity at the same time maintaining the simple headspace instrumentation and it is recommended for compounds at trace levels. The use of a liner packed with Tenax-TA allowed the compounds of interest to be retained during the venting process. The signals obtained when hot-split injection was used allowed quantification of all the compounds according to the thresholds of the European Cosmetics Directive. Monodimensional gas chromatography coupled to a conventional quadrupole mass spectrometry detector was used and the 24 analytes were separated appropriately along a run time of about 12 min. Use of the standard addition procedure as a quantification technique overcame the matrix effect. It should be emphasized that the method showed good precision and accuracy. Furthermore, it is rapid, simple, and - in view of the results - highly suitable for the determination of suspected allergens in different cosmetic products.",

The volatile oil was extracted by water-steam distillation and analyzed by GC-MS. Forty-nine compounds, which occupied 79.55% of total constituents, were identified. The major constituents were linalool, beta-eudesmene, phytol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate and nonyl aldehyde. The chemical constituents of volatile oil, which contain many bioactive constituents, are mainly composed of terpenes, esters, and alkanes.",

The HS-SPME procedure, whose experimental parameters were properly optimized, was carried out using a 100 um polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber. The GC-MS analyses were performed on a HP-5 MS cross-linked 5% diphenyl-95% dimethyl polysiloxane capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm I.D., 1.00 um film thickness), under programmed-temperature elution. Ninety-nine constituents were identified using this technique in the samples of raw propolis collected from different Italian regions. The main compounds detected include benzoic acid (0.87-30.13%) and its esters, such as benzyl benzoate (0.16-13.05%), benzyl salicylate (0.34-1.90%) and benzyl cinnamate (0.34-3.20%). Vanillin was detected in most of the samples analyzed in this study (0.07-5.44%). Another relevant class of volatile constituents is represented by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, such as delta-cadinene (1.29-13.31%), gamma-cadinene (1.36-8.85%) and alpha-muurolene (0.78-6.59%), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, such as beta-eudesmol (2.33-12.83%), T-cadinol (2.73-9.95%) and alpha-cadinol (4.84-9.74%). Regarding monoterpene hydrocarbons, they were found to be present at low level in the samples analyzed in this study, with the exception of one sample from Southern Italy, where alpha-pinene was the most abundant constituent (13.19%). The results obtained by HS-SPME-GC-MS were also compared with those of hydrodistillation (HD) coupled with GC-MS. The HS-SPME-GC-MS method developed in this study allowed us to determine the chemical fingerprint of propolis volatile constituents, thus providing a new and reliable tool for the complete characterization of this biologically active apiary product.",

Recent studies indicate that some organic UV-filters can accumulate in biota and act as endocrine disruptors, but there are few studies on the occurrence and fate of these compounds in humans. In the present work, a new liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to assess the presence of six UV-filters in current use (benzyl salicylate, phenyl salicylate, octyl salicylate, homosalate, 3-(4-methylbenzylidene) camphor, and 3-benzylidene camphor) in human placental tissue is proposed. The method involves the extraction of the analytes from the samples using ethyl acetate, followed by a clean-up step using centrifugation prior to their quantification by LC-MS/MS using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface. Bisphenol A-d16 was used as surrogate for the determination of benzyl salicylate, phenyl salicylate, octyl salicylate and homosalate in negative mode and benzophenone-d10, was used as surrogate for the determination of 3-(4-methylbenzylidene) camphor and 3-benzylidene camphor in positive mode. The found limits of detection ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 ng/g and the limits of quantification ranged from 1.3 to 2.0 ng/g, while variability was under 13.7%. Recovery rates for spiked samples ranged from 97% to 104%. Moreover, the interactions of these compounds with the human estrogen receptor alpha (hERalpha) and androgen receptor (hAR), using two in vitro bioassays based on reporter gene expression and cell proliferation assessment, were also investigated. All tested compounds, except benzyl salicylate and octyl salicylate, showed estrogenic activity in the E-Screen bioassay whereas only homosalate and 3-(4-methylbenzylidene) camphor were potent hAR antagonists. Although free salicylate derivatives and free camphor derivatives were not detected in the human placenta samples analyzed, the observed estrogenic and anti-androgenic activities of some of these compounds support the analysis of their occurrence and their role as endocrine disrupters in humans.",

Benzyl salicylate is widely used in soap and cosmetic industry as fragrance; also effective in absorbing UV light, and can be used in protective sunscreen lotions. Benzyl salicylate is also used in deodorant sprays. HUMAN STUDIES: Benzyl salicylate has a very low potential to induce hypersensitivity or to elicit reactions presumably attributable to pre-existing sensitization. Estrogenic potential of benzyl salicylate was tested using an in vitro human estrogen receptor alpha(hERalpha)-coactivator recruiting assay. Benzyl salicylate showed obvious in vitro hERalpha agonistic activities and exhibited a higher estrogenic activity compared to bisphenol A. Estrogenic activity was also demonstrated in assays using the estrogen-responsive MCF7 human breast cancer cell line. ANIMAL STUDIES: Benzyl salicylate was not irritating in the isolated bovine cornea test. Erythema was observed in the rabbit skin test. Estrogenic potential of benzyl salicylate was tested using an in vivo immature rodent uterotrophic bioassay. The uterine weights were significantly increased in mice treated with 11.1, 33.3, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day benzyl salicylate and rats treated with 3.7, 11.1, 33.3 and 100 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Benzyl salicylate was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 with or without metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Zebra fish (Danio rerio) were exposed to benzyl salicylate at 0, 0.7, 1.0, 1.4, 2.0 or 2.8 mg/L under static-renewal conditions for 96 hours. Mortalities were noted at 2.0 and 2.8 mg/L. Fish at these concentrations exhibited normal swimming behavior. No effects were seen at concentrations </= 1.4 mg/L.",

However chlorine based disinfectants, the most commonly used, are known to lead to the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs), some of which have been associated with adverse health effects. Precursors of DBPs include the organic matter present in the water used to fill the swimming pool, human body fluids and personal care products (PCPs) used by swimmers and bathers. The increased use, in the last years, of PCPs lead to an increased concern about the fate of PCPs in swimming pool waters and potential health risks of formed DBPs. In this study, the chemical transformations of two salicylates, benzyl salicylate (BzS) and phenyl salicylate (PS), incorporated in several PCPs, in chlorinated water were investigated. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-diode-array detection (HPLC-UV-DAD) was used to follow the reaction kinetics and HPLC with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was used to tentatively identify the major transformation by-products. Under the experimental conditions used in this work both salicylates reacted with chlorine following pseudo-first order kinetics: rate constant k = (0.0038 +/- 0.0002) min(-1) and half-life t1/2 = (182 +/- 10) min for BzS and rate constant k = (0.0088 +/- 0.0005) min(-1) and half-life t1/2 = (79 +/- 4) min for PS (mean =/- standard deviation). The reactions of the two salicylates in chlorinated water led to the formation of DBPs that were tentatively identified as mono- and dichloro- substituted compounds. Most probably they result from an electrophilic substitution of one or two hydrogen atoms in the phenolic ring of both salicylates by one or two chlorine atoms.",

Results obtained from fragrance and formulator companies for a total of 10,538 patch tests on benzyl salicylate alone, on a variety of household and personal care consumer products and on fragrance blends containing benzyl salicylate were analyzed as part of this survey. No induced or elicited responses directly attributable to benzyl salicylate were observed in the 35 patch tests on benzyl salicylate alone, or in the 10,503 patch tests on consumer products or fragrance blends containing benzyl salicylate. The highest concentration of benzyl salicylate tested in the consumer-product tests was 2 x 10(-1)%, and benzyl salicylate alone was tested at 10% in ethanol. This study indicates that benzyl salicylate has a very low potential to induce hypersensitivity ('induced' reactions) or to elicit reactions presumably attributable to pre-existing sensitization ('elicited' reactions) and thus supports the safe use of benzyl salicylate in consumer products and fragrance blends.",

We evaluated the estrogenic potentials of phenyl salicylate (PhS), benzyl salicylate (BzS), phenethyl salicylate (PES), ethyl salicylate (ES) and methyl salicylate (MS) using an in vitro human estrogen receptor alpha(hERalpha)-coactivator recruiting assay and in vivo immature rodent uterotrophic bioassays. We found that PhS, BzS and PES showed obvious in vitro hERalpha agonistic activities; BzS in particular exhibited a higher estrogenic activity compared to bisphenol A (BPA). The uterine weights were significantly increased in mice treated with 11.1, 33.3, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day BzS and 33.3 mg/kg/day PES and rats treated with 3.7, 11.1, 33.3 and 100 mg/kg/day BzS for 3 days (P<0.05). Finally, we transformed the daily intakes and the dermal exposures of SEs in the real world into estradiol equivalent concentrations (EEQs). ...",

Seven plasticizers and two metabolites were diluted to concentrations ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-4) M. Four commercial tissue conditioners were also diluted to concentrations ranging from 2 x 10(-8) to 2 x 10(-3) g/mL. Estrogenic activities were tested by the E-screen test using MCF-7 cells. When estrogen is present, the cells proliferate. Instead of counting the cells or nuclei directly, cell numbers were assessed by measurement of the total protein content using the sulforhodamine B assay. The liquid compositions of the four commercial tissue conditioners were examined by high-performance liquid chromatography. n-Butyl benzyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, n-butyl phthalyl n-butyl glycolate, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and benzyl salicylate significantly increased proliferation of MCF-7 cells. The remaining two plasticizers, di-2-ethylhexyl adipate and benzyl benzoate, as well as two metabolites of dibutyl phthalate and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, i.e. monobutyl phthalate and mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, respectively, did not increase proliferation of MCF-7 cells at the concentrations tested. ... Except for benzyl benzoate and di-2-ethylhexyl adipate, the plasticizers tested showed estrogenic activity. The four commercial tissue conditioners tested also showed estrogenic activity, and HC showed especially strong estrogenicity.",

We report here that all three compounds possess estrogenic activity in assays using the estrogen-responsive MCF7 human breast cancer cell line. At 3,000,000-fold molar excess, they were able to partially displace [(3)H]estradiol from recombinant human estrogen receptors ERalpha and ERbeta, and from cytosolic ER of MCF7 cells. At concentrations in the range of 5 x 10(-5) to 5 x 10(-4) m, they were able to increase the expression of a stably integrated estrogen-responsive reporter gene (ERE-CAT) and of the endogenous estrogen-responsive pS2 gene in MCF7 cells, albeit to a lesser extent than with 10(-8) m 17beta-oestradiol. They increased the proliferation of estrogen-dependent MCF7 cells over 7 days, which could be inhibited by the antiestrogen fulvestrant, suggesting an ER-mediated mechanism. Although the extent of stimulation of proliferation over 7 days was lower with these compounds than with 10(-8) m 17beta-oestradiol, given a longer time period of 35 days the extent of proliferation with 10(-4) m benzyl salicylate, benzyl benzoate or butylphenylmethylpropional increased to the same magnitude as observed with 10(-8) m 17beta-estradiol over 14 days. ...",

We evaluated the estrogenic potentials of phenyl salicylate (PhS), benzyl salicylate (BzS), phenethyl salicylate (PES), ethyl salicylate (ES) and methyl salicylate (MS) using an in vitro human estrogen receptor alpha (hERalpha)-coactivator recruiting assay and in vivo immature rodent uterotrophic bioassays. We found that PhS, BzS and PES showed obvious in vitro hERalpha agonistic activities; BzS in particular exhibited a higher estrogenic activity compared to bisphenol A (BPA). The uterine weights were significantly increased in mice treated with 11.1, 33.3, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day BzS and 33.3 mg/kg/day PES and rats treated with 3.7, 11.1, 33.3 and 100 mg/kg/day BzS for 3 days (P<0.05). Finally, we transformed the daily intakes and the dermal exposures of SEs in the real world into estradiol equivalent concentrations (EEQs). We found that the EEQ of BzS daily intake in consumers in the U.S. and the EEQs of dermal BzS and PES exposure among high-volume users worldwide were higher than the maximum secure daily estradiol intake recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In particular, the EEQ for dermal BzS exposure was up to 162 ng EEQ/kg, which is 3.3 times higher than the maximal acceptable daily E(2) intake recommended by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).",

The validity of using specific fragrance ingredients versus a mixture of fragrances was evaluated in terms of predicting allergy to different fragrance ingredients. One hundred sixty-seven subjects were evaluated in seven centers worldwide with a fragrance mix, the eight ingredients in the fragrance mixture, six other well-known fragrance allergens, balsam of Peru, and 15 lesser studied fragrance materials. The age of the patients was 44.9 +/- 17.5 years (mean +/- SD). More than 85% were women. A relatively high proportion gave a past history of atopic disease. Facial eruptions (40%) and hand involvement (26.7%) were the most common topographic sites. All but 4 of the 35 fragrance materials produced a positive response in > 1%. A reaction to fragrance mix occurred in 47.3%. Seven of the 34 ingredients tested produced an allergic response in more than 10% of those tested. Men were more likely than women to exhibit a positive response to five fragrance ingredients. White persons were more likely to react to perfume mix (52.8% versus 25.3%) and certain ingredients in the mix than Asian persons. Allergy to benzyl salicylate was more common in Japan than in Europe or the United States. The age at which patients with perfume allergy present for evaluation is similar to that of other contactants. Atopic individuals may be overrepresented in this group of patients. Face involvement is likely. White persons are more likely to react to fragrance mix, whereas in Asian patients benzyl salicylate was a more frequent allergen. Fragrance mix corrected with 85.6% of positive responses to fragrance ingredients. The addition of ylang ylang oil, narcissus oil, and sandalwood oil to fragrance mix would be expected to pick up 94.2% with positive responses to fragrance materials; adding balsam of Peru increases this to 96%.",

Inhibitory effects on fungal growth and/or acid production were found to vary depending upon the components of soft lining materials. In particular, two plasticizers, benzyl benzoate (BB) and benzyl salicylate (BS), significantly decreased the growth rate, whereas the size of polymer particle had little effect on fungal growth. Ethyl alcohol content of liquid significantly affected the fungal growth and/or acid production depending upon the plasticizer used. For instance, in the case of BS, the antifungal effect was related to ethyl alcohol contents, whereas a reverse effect was observed with benzyl n-butyl phthalate (BBP). Further examination using scanning electron microscopy revealed that Candida blastospores colonized lining materials in the following two ways depending on the plasticizers used. On the BS and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) specimen, the blastospore of this yeast associated loosely, whereas, in the case of BB, BBP and butyl phthalyl butyl glycorate (BPBG), fungal blastospore tightly and invasively colonized onto the specimens. These results clearly demonstrated a relationship between components of soft lining materials and fungal growth and colonization.",

Very few studies have been carried out on the chemical profile or the biological activity of the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) species. In the study reported here, the allelopathic activity of AcOEt and MeOH extracts of leaves, stems, and roots from Ocotea pulchella Nees was evaluated. The extracts were assayed on etiolated wheat coleoptiles. The AcOEt leaf extract was the most active and this was tested on standard target species (STS). Lycopersicon esculentum and Lactuca sativa were the most sensitive species in this test. A total of eleven compounds have been isolated and characterized. Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 6 have not been identified previously from O. pulchella and ocoteol (9) is reported for the first time in the literature. Eight compounds were tested on wheat coleoptile growth, and spathulenol, benzyl salicylate, and benzyl benzoate showed the highest activities. These compounds showed inhibitory activity on L. esculentum. The values obtained correspond to the activity exhibited by the extract and these compounds may therefore be responsible for the allelopathic activity shown by O. pulchella.",

Benzyl salicylate occurs naturally in balsams of Peru amd Tolu, in the flower oils of hyacinths and wallflowers, in ylang-ylang oil and in other essential oils and as a volatile constituent of various plant flowers. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7.8X0-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzyl salicylate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzyl salicylate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 22 hours. Particulate-phase benzyl salicylate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benzyl salicylate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzyl salicylate is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Benzyl salicylate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Manometric Respirometry test, 93% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, benzyl salicylate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 14 and 160 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 320 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Benzyl salicylate may undergo slow hydrolysis in alkaline soils and waters. Occupational exposure to benzyl salicylate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzyl salicylate is produced or used. Use data and monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzyl salicylate via inhalation of air containing product vapors, ingestion of food containing benzyl salicylate, dermal contact with essential oils, waters, and consumer products containing benzyl salicylate(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces may occur(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 7.8X10-5 mm Hg(3), and water solubility, 8.8 mg/L(3). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 14 and 160 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 320(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 4.31(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). Utilizing the Manometric Respirometry test, 93% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that benzyl salicylate is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 14 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 160 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. Benzyl salicylate's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Benzyl salicylate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

Benzyl salicylate was identified as 0.4% of the content of essential oil from an evergreen bush, Rhododendron caucasicum(3). Benzyl salicylate was identified as a constituent of the essential oil from leaf stem and roots samples of Alpinia menghaiensis and Alpinia maclurei from Vietnam(4). Benzyl salicylate was identified as a constituent of the essential oil of meadowsweet flowers (Filipendula sp)(5). Benzyl salicylate occurs naturally in balsams of Peru amd Tolu(5).",

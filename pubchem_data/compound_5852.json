ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Perfusion of the small intestine showed that the chelating agents and cysteine decreased the absorption of mercuric chloride depending on their stability of constants wtih Hg2+, under the predominant conditions of water absorption and secretion. The difference in absorption of mercuric chloride between both conditions was inversely correlated with their logarithmic stability constant values. These agents decreased the transport of mercuric chloride through the everted intestinal wall and the uptake of mercuric chloride by the intestinal brush border membrane in a similar manner. From these results, it is suggested that the chelating agents and cysteine decrease the absorption of mercuric chloride through the pores of the brush border membrane due to th solvent drag effect.",

In each case, low molecular weight metabolites (previously identified as disulfides) and a mixed disulfide between D-penicillamine and albumin (D-penicillamine-protein) formed. The rates of D-penicillamine elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to low molecula weight metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-penicillamine protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-penicillamine may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-penicillamine protein disulfides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.",

From in vitro studies which indicate that one atom of copper combines with two molecules of penicillamine. Penicillamine also reduces excess cystine excretion in cystinuria. This is done, at least in part, by disulfide interchange between penicillamine and cystine, resulting in formation of penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, a substance that is much more soluble than cystine and is excreted readily. Penicillamine interferes with the formation of cross-links between tropocollagen molecules and cleaves them when newly formed. The mechanism of action of penicillamine in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown although it appears to suppress disease activity. Unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants, penicillamine markedly lowers IgM rheumatoid factor but produces no significant depression in absolute levels of serum immunoglobulins. Also unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants which act on both, penicillamine in vitro depresses T-cell activity but not B-cell activity.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

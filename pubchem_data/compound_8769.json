Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.5x10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethydiethanolamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyldiethanolamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.7 hrs. Ethyldiethanolamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethyldiethanolamine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1 for the neutral species. The estimated pKa of ethyldiethanolamine is 8.7, indicating that this compound will partially exist in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-10 atm-cu m/mole for the neutral species. A 4% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, ethyldiethanolamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant for the neutral species. BCF values of <1.1 and <11 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to ethyldiethanolamine may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyldiethanolamine is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant for the neutral species of 1.1X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). An estimated pKa of 8.7(5) indicates ethyldiethanolamine will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(6). According to a classification scheme(6), and BCF values of <1.1 and <11(7), suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A 4% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(7) suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The mean half-life and mean residence time were 1.84 and 1.69 hr. respectively. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state was estimated to be 22.4 liters, and the plasma clearance was 14.6 liters/hr. The bioavailability of PCMX was 21%. ... PCMX's metabolite data show that a presystemic elimination process (first-pass effect) is also occurring. PCMX plasma concentrations after intravenous administration of 500-, 200-, and 100-mg doses were found to be proportional to the dose given.",

The primary metabolites discovered in the excreted urine were glucuronides and sulfates. Some chloroxylenol monographs liken its pharmacokinetic profile to that of another antiseptic - triclosan - which is rapidly excreted in the urine also as a glucuronide metabolite, as observed in the human model.  Moreover, In one human subject administered 5 mg intragluteally, 14% was excreted with glucuronic acid and 17% with sulfuric acid at 3 days.  Any chloroxylenol absorbed into the body is likely extensively metabolized by the liver and rapidly excreted, mainly in the urine, as sulphate and glucuronide conjugates.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

To remove pesticide residues, use a bucket to rinse tools or equipment three times, including any containers or utensils that you used when mixing the pesticide. Then pour the rinsewater into the pesticide sprayer and reuse the solution by applying it according to the pesticide product label directions. After applying any pesticide wash your hands and any other parts of your body that may have come in contact with the pesticide..To prevent tracking pesticides inside, remove or rinse your boots or shoes before entering your home. Wash any clothes that have been exposed to a lot of pesticide separately from your regular wash."

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Chloroxylenol is found on List C.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.1 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates chloroxylenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase chloroxylenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.8 hours. Chloroxylenol does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and has been reported to be stable to sunlight for up to 24 hours. If released to soil, chloroxylenol is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,400. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Chloroxylenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant.  Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 hours and 9 days, respectively. Degradation of chloroxylenol appears to be slower than other phenol derivatives. Studies in sewage showed 80-95% of the original compound remaining after 2 days and 60-70% remaining after 7 days. This is consistent with other studies that showed less than 40% degradation in activated sludge over 7 days. If released into water, chloroxylenol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. An estimated BCF of 66 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to chloroxylenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chloroxylenol is produced or used. The most likely route of exposure to the general population is through dermal contact when using soaps or cleaning products that contain chloroxylenol as an antibacterial. A smaller population may be exposed to chloroxylenol when taking medications that contain chloroxylenol as an active ingredient. (SRC)",

Volatilization of chloroxylenol  from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mol(SRC), derived using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Chloroxylenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). Degradation of chloroxylenol appears to be slower than other phenol derivatives(5,6). Studies in sewage showed 95-80% of the original compound remaining after 2 days and 60-70% remaining after 7 days(5). This is consistent with other studies that showed less than 40% degradation in activated sludge over 7 days(6).",

Volatilization of chloroxylenol from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mol(SRC) derived using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 66(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Degradation of chloroxylenol appears to be slower than other phenol derivatives(7,8). Studies in sewage showed 80-95% of the original compound remaining after 2 days and 60-70% remaining after 7 days(7). This is consistent with other studies that showed less than 40% degradation in activated sludge after 7 days(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

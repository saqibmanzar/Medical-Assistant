PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A 50% mortality rate was obtained at the longest exposure to 15 mg/L. Sex related differences in the blood levels of PA and pinacolone were noted, and the surviving male rats failed to gain weight normally in the first week after exposure. In rats exposed to 5.0 mg/L for 6 hours, there were reductions in horizontal and vertical activity and the minute volume was 55% of controls at the end of exposure. Like many secondary alcohols, PA poses only a possible inhalation hazard; however, male rats may be somewhat more susceptible than females.",

Exposures were for 6 hr per day, 5 days per week with sacrifices at 7 and 13 weeks of exposure, and at 4 weeks after exposure. The test animals were evaluated for abnormalities in physiology, behavior, clinical laboratory parameters, and gross and microscopic morphology. No abnormalities were detected in electrocardiograms, respiratory indices, spontaneous activity, passive avoidance activity and open-field behaviour. Clinical signs related to PA exposure included alopecia, ataxia and lacrimation. There were no biologically significant between-group differences in body-weights during the study. The clinical laboratory data demonstrated a 30% increase in serum cholesterol and bilirubin at 7 weeks in high-dose males and an increase in urea nitrogen in intermediate and high-dose males at 13 weeks. There were no abnormalities in hematologic or coagulation parameters. At necropsy there were no significant gross abnormalities; however, examination of organ weights revealed enlarged kidneys in high-dose male rats at 13 weeks, enlarged ovaries in high-dose female rats at 13 weeks, and microscopic study of tissue sections revealed minimal to mild renal tubular injury in high and possibly intermediate dose males at several sacrifices. These findings suggest that the primary target organ of PA, when given by inhalation, is the kidney in male rats and possibly the ovary in female rats. The renal changes in the high-dose males were not fully reversible during the recovery period.",

Growth inhibition tests (96 hr) were conducted using Ankistrodesmus falcatus, EC50 = 257.7 mg PA/L.

Its production and use may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pinacolyl alcohol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pinacolyl alcohol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 42 hours. Pinacolyl alcohol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pinacolyl alcohol is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 150. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Pinacolyl alcohol may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure 8.8 mm Hg. If released into water, pinacolyl alcohol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon a Koc of 150. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 53 hours and 19 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 2.8 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to pinacolyl alcohol may occur through inhalation of vapor and dermal contact at workplaces where pinacolyl alcohol is produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase pinacolyl alcohol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 42 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 9.2X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

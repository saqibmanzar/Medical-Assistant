When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 200 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl isocyanate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl isocyanate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 days. Ethyl isocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Isocyanates undergo rapid hydrolysis under environmental conditions with half-lives of less than 10 minutes. Therefore, hydrolysis is expected to be the dominant fate process for ethyl isocyanate in moist soil and water. If released to soil, adsorption, biodegradation, and volatilization from moist soil surfaces are not expected to compete with hydrolysis as important fate and transport processes; however, ethyl isocyanate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released to water, adsorption to sediment, bioconcentration, biodegradation, and volatilization from water surfaces are not expected to compete with hydrolysis as important fate and transport processes. Occupational exposure to ethyl isocyanate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl isocyanate is produced or used. (SRC)",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 15 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Ethyl isocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(2). Isocyanates react rapidly with nucleophilic reagents(3,4); therefore, ethyl isocyanate is expected to undergo rapid hydrolysis in moist soil and water(SRC). The rate of hydrolysis for ethyl isocyanate is not available; however, the measured rate constants for the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl isocyanate in aqueous solution at 15 and 25 \u00b0C are 5.9X10-4 sec-1 and 1.34X10-3 sec-1, respectively(5). These correspond to half-lives of 20 and 9 min, respectively. In a spill situation, reaction of isocyanates with water yields an unstable carbamate which undergoes decarboxylation to form carbon dioxide plus the corresponding amine(3). The amine then reacts with isocyanate to form a symmetrically disubstituted urea(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

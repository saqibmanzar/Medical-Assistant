PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

HUMAN STUDIES: The substance defats the skin, which may cause dryness or cracking. It is irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract. Exposure at high levels could cause depression of the central nervous system. ANIMAL STUDIES: Watery eyes, anorexia, rapid shallow breathing, and excess salivation were observed in rats given a single dose of 4000, 6300, or 10,000 mg/kg 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate. 1-Methoxy-2-propyl acetate was not a skin irritant in rabbits. 10% 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate in water was not a sensitizer in a guinea pig maximization test. Some slight changes were observed in the appearance of renal tissues in rats exposed to 3000 ppm 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate. Slight to moderate degeneration of the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavities was seen in rats and in mice. 1-Methoxy-2-propyl acetate had no adverse effect on reproductive parameters in rat developmental studies. 1-Methoxy-2-propyl acetate did not induce mutations or toxicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 or in Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA, with or without metabolic activation.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of3.92 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 32 hrs. Using an atmospheric simulation chamber, no photolysis of 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate was observed; therefore, the compound is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate is expected to have very high mobility based upon a Koc of 2.3. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Methoxy-2-propyl acetate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 50% Biodegradation in less than one day using sandy and sandy loam soils suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. 100% Biodegadation in the Zahn-Wellens test indicates that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 and 93 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be a slow environmental fate based on second-order hydrolysis half-lives of 2.5 years and 88 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate via inhalation of and dermal contact with consumer products containing 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate. (SRC)",

GC-FID, GC-MS, and FT-IR techniques were used to investigate the reaction mechanism in the presence of NO. The products formed from the reaction of MPA with OH and their yields were methyl formate (80%), acetic acid (50%), and acetic anhydride (22 %), while for Cl reaction, the obtained yields were 60, 41, and 11%, respectively, for the same products. The UV absorption cross section spectrum of MPA was determined in the wavelength range 210-370 nm. The study has shown no photolysis of MPA under atmospheric conditions.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Statistical models of the exposure determinants for the target agents found production level, as indicated by number of semiconductor wafer cassettes loaded/unloaded from the target machines or baths, was predictive of fluoride, xylene and 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate exposures. The percent of fresh air ventilation and the percent of xylene in the photoresist were also significant determinants in the statistical model predicting personal xylene exposure levels.",

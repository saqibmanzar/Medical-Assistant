When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Different concentrations of cadmium chloride, zinc chloride, or cupric acetate were added to the culture media. The Na(+)-glucose cotransport was estimated from the uptake of radiolabeled alpha-methylglucoside using scintillation counting techniques. Metallothionein was measured by Sephadex-G-75 column chromatography and subsequent high performance liquid chromatography. For Cd(2+) and Cu(2+), an increase in concentration resulted in an increase in the extent of inhibition of the Na(+)-glucose cotransport with approximately 3 hour lag times for the induction of inhibition. Increases in metal ion concentration also resulted in slower increases of metallothionein protein, with the rapid induction of metallothionein messenger RNA after incubation with the ions. Pretreatment of the cells with zinc(2+) reduced the effects of Cd(2+) and Cu(2+) on the cotransport by delaying the onset and reducing the extent of the inhibition.",

The surviving rats in the group given dimethylnitrosamine (25 ppm) in the drinking water alone were killed at 26 wk and it was found that 12 of 16 rats had developed liver tumors. In the group given dimethylnitrosamine and cupric acetate (sc injections of 2 copper/kg once a week for 26 wk), 7 of 22 rats developed liver tumors. The incidence of liver tumors in rats given dimethylnitrosamine and cupric acetate was thus only about 40% of that in rats given dimethylnitrosamine alone. No tumor was observed in the group given saline or cupric acetate alone. The thymidine incorporation into the liver DNA of rats given dimethylnitrosamine was significantly suppressed by the administration of cupric acetate. The methylation of liver DNA in rats given a single dose of dimethylnitrosamine was also significantly suppressed by sc injection of cupric acetate; the formation of both O6-methylguanine and 7-methylguanine was reduced. This result suggests that sc injection of cupric acetate may have a suppressive effect on the initiation of carcinogenesis in the liver.",

It has been tried in a number of treatments for inflammatory disorders, mainly in Chinese and folk medicine. However, there is concern over their use as aristolochic acid is both carcinogenic and nephrotoxic. It has a role as a nephrotoxin, a carcinogenic agent, a mutagen, a toxin and a metabolite. It is a monocarboxylic acid, a C-nitro compound, a cyclic acetal, an organic heterotetracyclic compound, an aromatic ether and a member of aristolochic acids.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

(A15444) AA is a nephrotoxic and carcinogenic compound, which has been demonstrated to be genotoxic and mutagenic both in vitro and in vivo. Toxicity and carcinogenicity of the nephrotoxic compound aristolochic acid between rodents and humans suggest a species-dependent mechanism of action. AA had a comparable effect on the cell cycle in primary human and porcine cells and the rat NRK-52E cell line following 48 h exposure, also corroborated by the reduced 3H-thymidine incorporation in NRK-52E cells. In addition, DNA unwinding, suggestive of enhanced DNA damage, was observed in primary porcine cells. (A15445)",

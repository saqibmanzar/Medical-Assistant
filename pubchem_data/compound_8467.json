When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Ethyl vanillin was rapidly absorbed and peak plasma radioactivity occurred within 2 hr after dosing at all dose levels, falling rapidly to undetectable levels within 96 hr. Plasma radioactivity tended to be higher in female than male rats and it was postulated that this might reflect a lower metabolic capacity of female rats.  Urinary excretion of radioactivity was rapid and more than 94% of the dose was excreted by this route within 24 hr. Only 1-5% of the dose was excreted in faeces. After 5 days, more than 99% of the administered dose was excreted. No radioactivity was detected in expired air, indicating that the aromatic ring was in a metabolically stable position.",

Another way is to look at the radiocarbon content, the amount of radioactive carbon-14. Natural plant-sourced vanillin contains a certain level of carbon-14, but since the half life of carbon-14 is 5730 years, vanillin derived from crude oil has no radiocarbon, since it has decayed away over the millions of years the oil was trapped underground. But determined forgers started putting some carbon-14 adulterated molecules into their fake vanilla extract.   To counter that, the analysts started looking at the ratio of the natural isotopes, carbon-12 and carbon-13. Because the vanilla orchid uses a different biosynthetic pathway to other plants, orchid-derived vanillin has a greater ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 than synthetic vanillin. The fraudsters hit back by doping their synthetic vanillin with molecules containing extra carbon-13. However, the fraudsters cannot get a uniform level of carbon-13 at all the carbons. Instead they tend to concentrate it at the aldehyde and methyl groups, and this can be spotted by chemists who use the aptly named site-specific natural isotope fractionation NMR (SNIF-NMR)",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

It is also used as a replacement of or to strengthen the flavor of vanilla in a variety of foods. Ethyl vanillin is a widely used food additive and spice in foods, beverages, cosmetics and drugs.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Research in humans showed that ethyl vanillin had no significant effect on the activity of five human CYP450 enzymes with concentration ranged from 8 to 128 uM. A 2% concentration of ethyl vanillin caused mild irritation on the skin of humans after 48 hours of direct contact. ANIMAL STUDIES: In animal studies, ethyl vanillin was found to be mostly non-toxic except when given at high doses for longer than 6 weeks. Rabbits were given ethyl vanillin orally in 10% aqueous glycerin 49 mg/kg bw/day for 43 days. At this dose level anemia, diarrhea and lack of weight gain were observed. Rats (20/sex/group) were fed ethyl vanillin of > 99.9% purity (nature of diet e.g., semi-synthetic/chow diet, not specified) at dose levels of 0, 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/kg bw/day for 13 weeks. Clinical biochemistry showed statistically significant higher values in the high-dose group compared to control for ALAT, ALP, cholesterol and total plasma protein. Histological examination revealed a dose-related increased incidence of hepatic peribiliary inflammatory change in both males and females of the intermediate- and high-dose groups, and minor bile duct hyperplasia affecting 1/20 intermediate- and 4/20 high-dose males. There were no changes observed in the liver parenchyma and no degenerative or inflammatory changes of the bile duct epithelium. Increased white pulp cellularity and prominence of germinal centers in the spleen, and increased prominence of germinal centers and lymphoid proliferation in cervical lymph nodes were seen in the intermediate- and high-dose groups. Groups of 12 male and 12 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 0.5, 1 and 2% ethyl vanillin for 2 years or 2% and 5% for one year without any adverse effects on growth, organ weights of major organs, hematology and histology of major tissues. In genotoxicity studies, ethyl vanillin did not induce genetic changes in vitro but was reported to enhance the ability of mitomycin C to cause sister chromatid exchanges. Ethyl vanillin  has shown to have anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties that are based on its suppressive effect on the production of nitric oxide possibly via decreasing the reactive oxygen species level. The in vivo results revealed that drug interaction between vanillin/ethyl vanillin and drugs metabolized by CYP2E1 or CYP1A2 might be possible, and also suggested that the application of the above additives in foods and drugs should not be unlimited so as to avoid the adverse interaction. The thermal tolerance Cronobacter sakazakii was examined in sterile powdered infant formula (PIF) rehydrated at 58 \u00b0C in water or apple juice supplemented with vanillin, ethyl vanillin, or vanillic acid. All three compounds decreased thermal tolerance during-rehydration. Supplementation of PIF with vanillin, ethyl vanillin, or vanillic acid could enhance the safety of PIF or other dehydrated foods contaminated with C. sakazakii.",

If vomiting occurs, lean patient forward or place on left side (head-down position, if possible) to maintain an open airway and prevent aspiration. Keep patient quiet and maintain normal body temperature. Obtain medical attention. /Phenols and related compounds/",

No clinical signs or treatment-related deaths of toxicological significance were observed in treated animals during the study. Food intake was statistically significantly reduced in females at the highest dose group at week 1, and in treated male groups at weeks 1-4; thereafter there were no significant differences in food intake between controls and treated animals. Water intake, measured accurately during week 12 of treatment, did not differ notably from controls. Body-weight gain in males and females in the high-dose group was significantly reduced compared to control throughout the study.... There were no treatment-related differences from control in hematological parameters at week 6 or at termination. Clinical biochemical analyses showed statistically significant higher values in the high-dose group compared to control for ALAT, ALP, cholesterol and total plasma protein. Cholesterol levels were significantly increased  in males at the intermediate-dose group at week 6 only. The authors considered the alteration of the clinical biochemical parameters secondary to the hepatic changes seen histologically. Other sporadic differences from control values were generally within normal ranges for the strain and were not considered of toxicological significance.  At autopsy, enlarged cervical lymph nodes were noted in males at the intermediate-dose group, and in both sexes at the highest dose group. In addition, there was a reduction in adipose tissue in rats of both sexes at the highest dose group. Absolute liver weights were similar to controls but relative liver weights were increased in the intermediate- and high-dose animals. Absolute and relative spleen weights were increased in the intermediate- and high-dose groups. Although relative spleen weights were increased in the low-dose males, the absolute organ weights were unaffected, and in the absence of histopathological changes this observation was considered by the authors to be of no toxicological significance.  Histological examination revealed a dose-related increased incidence of hepatic peribiliary inflammatory change in both males and females of the intermediate- and high-dose groups, and minor bile duct hyperplasia affecting 1/20 intermediate- and 4/20 high-dose males. There were no changes observed in the liver parenchyma and no degenerative or inflammatory changes of the bile duct epithelium. Increased white pulp cellularity and prominence of germinal centres in the spleen, and increased prominence of germinal centres and lymphoid proliferation in cervical lymph nodes were seen in the intermediate- and high-dose groups. The authors considered the findings of the lymphoid tissue to be associated reactive changes to the hepatic peribiliary inflammatory observations.",

Control animals receiving i.p. injections of the vehicle, tricaprylin, had survival rates of 77/80 (males) and 77/80 (females).  In the control group, 28% of males and 23% of females developed lung tumours whereas in the treated groups only one animal, in the higher dose group, exhibited a single lung nodule.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.04X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl vanillin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl vanillin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 day. Particulate-phase ethyl vanillin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Ethyl vanillin contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethyl vanillin is expected to have high mobility based upon a estimated Koc of 60. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.1X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyl vanillin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 88% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, ethyl vanillin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to ethyl vanillin may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl vanillin is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ethyl vanillin via ingestion of food and dermal contact with consumer products containing ethyl vanillin. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase ethyl vanillin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 day(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.3X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC). Particulate-phase ethyl vanillin may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Ethyl vanillin contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

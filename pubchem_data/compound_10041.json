Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket. CAUTION: When LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972) is released on or near water, product may vaporize explosively. (ERG, 2024)",

Explosive limits specify the concentration range of a material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an ignition source. There are two types of explosive limits: lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL). The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

If this is impossible then take the following precautions: Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry. Let the fire burn. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety device or any discoloration of tanks due to fire. For tank, rail car or tank truck: Stop leak if possible without personal risk. Let burn unless leak can be stopped immediately. For smaller tanks or cylinders, extinguish and isolate from other flammables. Evacuation radius: 800 meters (1/2 mile).

Use a high-expansion foam if available to reduce vapors. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as a research chemical and in the manufacture of butyl rubber. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Drinking of dimethylpropane is expected to cause nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Dimethylpropane is expected to be a potential aspiration hazard when swallowed because of its low surface tension and low viscosity. Once in the respiratory system, it can lead to spasms of the bronchial system, edema and hemorrhaging, chemical pneumonitis, asphyxia, or death. Signs and symptoms include coughing, choking, and gasping. Dimethylpropane vapor is nontoxic when inhaled except at very high concentrations exceeding the lower flammability limit. When large quantities are inhaled, dimethylpropane acts as an anesthetic and asphyxiant. At these high levels it will cause CNS depression such as drowsiness, anesthesia, and at higher concentrations, coma and death. Repeated or prolonged contact with skin may cause dermatitis. No further studies on human exposure or toxicity could be located. ANIMAL STUDIES: Dimethylpropane caused light anesthesia in mice exposed to 200,000 ppm for 30 min and anesthesia (loss of posture) at 270,000 ppm for 3 min exposure. Dimethylpropane was lethal to 40% of the mice exposed for 2 hr at a concentration of 340,000 ppm. After 2 hr of anesthesia, the surviving mice recovered quickly on average in 4 min. Dimethylpropane is hydroxylated by rat liver microsomes to its parent alcohol 2,2-dimethylpropanol. No other animal studies could be located.",

The time course of the hydroxylation reaction was measured separately for the various isomeric alcohols examined. The effect of aliphatic substrates on the difference spectra of microsomes from untreated control and phenobarbital induced rats was examined. The amount of cytochrome-P-450 formed was measured spectroscopically. Linearity of the yields of the alcohols examined with the microsomal protein concentrations and with time was observed up to 2 milligrams per milliliter and this concentration of microsomal protein was used in the assays. During microsomal hydroxylation the isomeric alcohols were formed by identical non linear kinetics in both pretreated and uninduced microsomes. Induction by phenobarbital caused a 4 to 5 fold increase in specific activity for all substrates: n-pentane , 2-methylbutane, 2,2-dimethylpropane , n-butane , isobutane, and methylcyclohexane. The specific activities for all substrates were in the same order of magnitude. For all aliphatic substrates phenobarbital induction increased the specific activity parallel to the shift in the oxidized cytochrome-P-450 spectrum. This was measured by the difference spectrum showing a peak at 388 nanometers and a trough at 420 nanometers after addition of the substrate to the microsomal suspension. In general, phenobarbital pretreatment produced a 4 to 5 fold increase in the substrate binding difference spectrum. The authors conclude that these aliphatic substrates are hydroxylated by the same cytochrome-P-450 species. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that cytochrome-P-450 forms a reversible enzyme/substrate complex which is reduced in the rate limiting step of the hydroxylation sequence.",

Neopentane is expected to be a potential aspiration hazard when swallowed because of its low surface tension and low viscosity. Once in the respiratory system, it can lead to spasms of the bronchial system, edema and hemorrhaging, chemical pneumonitis, asphyxia, or death. Signs and symptoms include coughing, choking, and gasping. ...Neopentane vapor when inhaled is nontoxic except at very high concentrations exceeding the lower flammability limit. When large quantities are inhaled, neopentane acts as an anesthetic and asphyxiant, which is typical of most light aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbons. At these high levels n-alkanes will cause CNS depression such as drowsiness, anesthesia, and at higher concentrations, coma and death.",

It's presence in gasoline may result in it's direct release to the environment. 2,2-Dimethylpropane is present at 0.07 vol % in naphtha. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1290 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,2-dimethylpropane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase 2,2-dimethylpropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 days. 2,2-Dimethylpropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,2-dimethylpropane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 500. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2 atm-cu m/mole. 2,2-Dimethylpropane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The highly branched structure of 2,2-dimethylpropane suggests that biodegradation in water will be slow. If released into water, 2,2-dimethylpropane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 hours and 3.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 52 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2,2-dimethylpropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,2-dimethylpropane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,2-dimethylpropane via inhalation of ambient air and possibly from cooked food. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 hours and 3.4 days, respectively(SRC). 2,2-Dimethylpropane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The hepatic availability of cholesterol substrate may be a determining factor. We examined whether there was a direct correlation between plasma concentrations of mevalonic acid (MVA) and lathosterol (indices of in vivo cholesterol synthesis) and hepatic secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) apo B in 13 normolipidaemic, healthy male subjects. The secretion of VLDL apo B was measured using a primed constant intravenous infusion of 1-[13C]-leucine (1 mg/kg per h) over 8 h. Gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) was used to derive isotopic enrichment of apo B and fractional turnover rate was calculated using a monoexponential function. There was a highly significant positive correlation between the absolute secretion rate (ASR) of VLDL apo B and the plasma concentrations of mevalonic acid (r = 0.72, P = 0.005) and lathosterol (r = 0.81, P = 0.001) and the lathosterol:cholesterol ratio (r = 0.79, P = 0.001). In multiple regression analysis, these correlations remained significant after adjusting for waist circumference, age, apolipoprotein E genotype and dietary fat intake. The data further support the notion that the availability of cholesterol substrate regulates the hepatic secretion rate of apo B.",

In normolipemic volunteers, excretion of mevalonic acid averaged 3.51 +/- 0.59 (SD) ug/kg x day1; (n = 24) and was not different from patients with hypercholesterolemia (3.30 +/- 0.92 ug/kg x day1; n = 24). In patients with cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis, the excretion was significantly higher (8.55 +/- 1.92 ug/kg x day1; n = 6, P < 0.001) but comparable to volunteers treated with cholestyramine (6.69 +/- 2.6 ug/kg x day1; n = 5). A significant correlation was found between 24-hr excretion of mevalonic acid and cholesterol synthesis (r = 0.835; n = 35; P < 0.001). The coefficient of variation of excretion of mevalonic acid during 3 consecutive days was small (9.8%; n = 7). However, urinary output of mevalonic acid was significantly higher during the night (164 +/- 14 ug/12 hr) than during the day (129 +/- 9 ug/12 hr; n = 11; P < 0.05). In patients treated with simvastatin (40 mg/day) for 6 weeks, the ratio of mevalonic acid to creatinine in a morning urine sample decreased significantly compared to pretreatment values (110 +/- 25 ug/g vs. 66 +/- 25 ug/g; P < 0.001). Furthermore, the ratio of mevalonic acid to creatinine in a morning urine sample correlated with the ratio from the 24-hr collection period (r = 0.714; n = 34; P < 0.001). The results indicate that the analysis of urinary mevalonic acid, either in 24-hr collection or in a single morning sample, is an attractive method for evaluation of long and very short term changes of the rates of cholesterol synthesis.",

Plasma mevalonic acid (MVA) concentrations were correlated (i) with increased rates of whole-body cholesterol synthesis (measured by sterol-balance methods) in patients treated with cholestryamine resin (ii) with decreased rates of whole-body sterol synthesis (indicated by conversion of labeled acetate to sterol in freshly isolated mononuclear leukocytes) in out-patients after 4 weeks on a cholesterol-rich diet. In addition, a diurnal rhythm of plasma MVA concentrations was observed in patients whose activities were strictly controlled on a metabolic ward. At the peak of the rhythm (between midnight and 3 a.m.) MVA concentrations were 3-5 times greater than at the nadir (between 9 a.m. and noon). Furthermore, a relationship between the diurnal rhythm of plasma MVA and endogenous cholesterol synthesis is suggested by /the/ finding that the plasma MVA rhythm was suppressed by cholesterol feeding (1,200 mg/day) and abolished by a 12-day fast...",

The effect of topical mevalonic acid on the murine epidermal permeability barrier function /was investigated/, comparing it with that of cholesterol. Topical treatment with acetone caused linear increases in transepidermal water loss, in proportion to the number of treatments more rapidly in aged mice than in young mice. Administration of mevalonic acid on aged murine epidermis enhanced its resistance against damage and the recovery rate of barrier function from acute barrier disruption. In contrast, although cholesterol also had the same effect, it required a much higher amount than mevalonic acid. In young mice, neither mevalonic acid nor cholesterol had any effect on resistance against acetone damage nor the recovery rate from acetone damage. In the skin of mice topically administered with mevalonic acid, stimulation of cholesterol synthesis and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity were both observed, whereas none was seen with stimulation by equimolar cholesterol. These data indicate that a topical application of mevalonic acid enhances barrier recovery in aged mice, which is accompanied by not only acceleration of cholesterol synthesis from mevalonic acid but also stimulation of the whole cholesterol biosynthesis.",

Drinking 1 L of beer at night containing 608 ug/L mevalonic acid more than doubled the urinary excretion of mevalonic acid the following 12 hours, on average from 103 +/- 15 microg/12 h to 211 +/- 17 ug/12 hr (P < .001; 18% of the administered dose). Drinking the same amount of alcohol as vodka had no effect, but urinary mevalonic acid output increased slightly the following day (7 AM to 7 PM) after ingestion of both alcoholic beverages. Serum concentrations of mevalonic acid were significantly increased the following morning after ingestion of beer (from 3.22 +/- 0.20 ng/mL to 6.79 +/- 0.58 ng/mL) or vodka (from 3.23 +/- 0.37 ng/mL to 5.36 +/- 0.55 ng/mL, P < .002 for both). An increase in the ratio of lathosterol to cholesterol in serum, another indicator of 3beta-hydroxy-3beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in the liver, was also observed (+18% and +25%, respectively). ... Studies using mevalonic acid as a marker of cholesterol synthesis must be carefully monitored regarding dietary mevalonic acid intake and alcohol consumption.",

Fluvastatin (Sandoz compound XU 62-320) is a potent inhibitor of this enzyme and, hence, mevalonic acid production. In three separate studies, oral administration of fluvastatin at 12 and 24 mg/kg/day to mated rats from day 15 of gestation through weaning resulted in unanticipated maternal mortality at the time of parturition and during lactation. Microscopic evaluations performed in two studies revealed significant cardiac myopathy in the dying animals. Drug-related clinical signs, significant maternal body weight loss, and an increase in stillborn pups and neonatal mortality were also noted at one or both dose levels. Supplementation of fluvastatin administration with 500 mg/kg b.i.d. of mevalonic acid completely blocked and/or ameliorated the mortality, cardiac myopathy, and other adverse effects. These studies indicate that the adverse maternal effects observed with fluvastatin before or following parturition resulted from exaggerated pharmacologic activity at the dose levels administered, i.e., inhibition of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, its immediate product mevalonic acid, and cholesterol biosynthesis.",

Approximately 30 cases have been reported. ... Data on two siblings with mevalonic aciduria /are contributed/ to the recognition of this subject. Both were born after uneventful pregnancies. Their parents were healthy and not consanguineous. They had normal somatic and psychomotor development until they were around 2 years old. After the second year of life they developed mental retardation, ataxia and hypotonia. MRI showed cerebellar atrophy of both hemispheres and vermis. One sibling, from the age of 10 years onwards, suffered from complex partial seizures that were controlled with levetiracetam and lamotrigine. At 11 and 12 years of age, respectively, they were able to walk without help, but their gait was broad and ataxic. Their speech was dysarthric, fine motor skills were impaired as result of cerebellar ataxia, and they had moderate mental retardation. Diagnosis of mevalonic aciduria was made at this age through urinary organic acid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, which revealed high urinary excretion of mevalonic acid. They are currently 18 and 17 years old, respectively, show mental retardation and are able to walk but with difficulty. In our patients, ataxia due to cerebellar atrophy and mental retardation have been the predominant clinical manifestations. In mildly affected patients who survive infancy, these seem to be the predominant findings.",

Rizatriptan causes transient increases in blood pressure to some extent. _In vitro_, rizatriptan was shown to contract isolated human coronary arteries; however, since the EC<sub>50</sub> for this effect is high, rizatriptan is not expected to cause myocardial ischemia at therapeutic plasma concentrations in patients with normal coronary circulation.  Rizatriptan has a weak affinity for other 5-HT1 receptor subtypes (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1E</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1F</sub>) and the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor but has no significant activity at 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, muscarinic or benzodiazepine receptors.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The Tmax is approximately one to 1.5 hours. The presence of a migraine headache did not appear to affect the absorption or pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of rizatriptan but delays the time to reach peak concentration by an hour. In clinical trials, rizatriptan was administered without regard to food.  The bioavailability and Cmax of rizatriptan were similar following the administration of rizatriptan tablets and rizatriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Still, the absorption rate is somewhat slower with orally disintegrating tablets, with Tmax delayed by up to 0.7 hours. The AUC of rizatriptan is approximately 30% higher in females than males.

                                            "String": "There are several physiological and molecular processes implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. Vasodilation of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, particularly those supplying the dura mater, has been associated with migraine pain. Activation of the trigeminovascular system leads to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides (such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and neurokinin A) from the trigeminal nerve innervating the intracranial vessels and dura mater. Vasoactive neuropeptides cause perivascular inflammation and vasodilation in the periphery. Migraine-associated nausea and vomiting are thought to arise from the activation of central and nociceptive sensory neurons that project to autonomic brain-stem nuclei and higher subcortical and cortical pain processing centres. An imbalance in serotonin (5-HT) levels has also been documented: 5-HT binds to 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors to promote trigeminal neuronal firing and vasoconstriction.  Rizatriptan is a selective agonist at the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system. It binds to these receptors with high affinity. The exact mechanism of action of rizatriptan has not been fully elucidated; however, several documented pharmacological actions of rizatriptan may contribute to its antimigraine effects. Rizatriptan causes vasoconstriction of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, which is thought to occur primarily via 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors. Rizatriptan also inhibits nociceptive neurotransmission in trigeminal pain pathways. It attenuates the release of vasoactive neuropeptides by the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to occur via neurogenic and central 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors. Rizatriptan inhibited neurogenic dural vasodilation and plasma protein extravasation in animal studies.",

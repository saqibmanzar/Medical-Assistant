ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A post-oxidation of the crude oxidation product with hydrogen peroxide or an alkali hypochlorite is advantageous. An alternative liquid-phase oxidation process involves the reaction of acenaphthene, molten or in alkanoic acid solvent, with oxygen or acid at about 70-200 \u00b0C in the presence of Mn resinate or stearate or Co or Mn salts and a bromide. Addition of an aliphatic anhydride accelerates the oxidation. The anhydride of 1,8-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid is obtained in about 95-116 wt % yield by the vapor-phase air-oxidation of acenaphthene at about 330-450 \u00b0C, using unsupported or supported vanadium oxide catalysts, with or without modifiers.",

Intradermal induction using an 0.1% formulation accompanied by simultaneous intradermal administration of Freund's complete adjuvant was followed after 1 wk by a 48 hr occlusive dermal induction using a 50% formulation( minimum irritancy formulation). Dermal challenge, which followed 14 days after the second induction treatment, was accomplished by application under occlusive cover of a 5% formulation to an anterior site on the flank of each guinea pig and similar treatment was carried out by applying a 10% formulation (maximum non-irritant concentration) to a posterior site on the animal's flank for 24 hours. This challenge led to a clear positive skin reaction in 16 of the 20 animals and produced a questionable positive skin reaction in 1 of the 20 animals. 1,8-Naphthalic anhydride thus exhibited a skin sensitizing potential in the test.",

Naphthalic anhydride's former production and use in the US as a seed protectant is expected to have resulted in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.1X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates naphthalic anhydride will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase naphthalic anhydride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15.5 hours. Particulate-phase naphthalic anhydride will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Naphthalic anhydride absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight; however the rate of this reaction is not known. If released to soil, naphthalic anhydride is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 120. Volatilization from water or moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.2X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Naphthalic anhydride is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its eatimated vapor pressure. Naphthalic anhydride is formed by the degradation of acenaphthylene-1,2-dione. Degradation studies of these two compounds showed 50% degradation of naphthalic anhydride after 29 days of treatment using a pilot-scale bioslurry treatment. If released into water, naphthalic anhydride is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. An estimated BCF of 63 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis of the anhydride to form the naphthalene 1,8 dicarboxylic acid is expected to be an important fate process. According to monitoring data the general population is expected to be exposed to naphthalic anhydride through inhalation from contaminated air where this compound has been detected in the fine particle organics.

Vapor-phase naphthalic anhydride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15.5 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.3X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase naphthalic anhydride may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Naphthalic anhydride absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight; however, the rate of this reaction is not known(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

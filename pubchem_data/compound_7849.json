When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

While hazardous by all routes, including percutaneous absorption, exposure to this colorless liquid occurs primarily via dermal contact and inhalation at sites where the substance is used as a solvent or chemical intermediate. Acute effects from exposure to 1-bromo-2-chloroethane range from irritation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes to death; with the latter sometimes occuring suddenly from ventricular fibrillation. Or, death may occur within a week (without proper treatment), during which time, the victim may experience an essentially asymptomatic interval of several days. Both acute and chronic exposure can lead to liver and/or kidney injury. Appropriate ventilation systems must be used to prevent buildup of 1-bromo-2-chloroethane vapor (chloroform-like odor) in work areas. If this is not possible, adequate personal protective equipment must be provided. If skin or eyes become contaminated, flush with copious amounts of water. Protection from exposure is especially recommended for persons with existing damage to, or suspected susceptibility to damage to the liver or kidney. While not reported to be a fire hazard, 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, when heated to decomposition, emits highly toxic fumes of chlorides and bromides. Before transporting 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, the regulatory requirements of the DOT must be consulted. Prior to implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

Vitamin E depletion may be dependent upon initial steps of DBE metabolism that are either oxidative (cytochrome p450 dependent) or conjugative (glutathione transferase dependent). That the liver content of glutathione (GSH) and vitamin E, the plasma concentration of vitamin E, and the serum activities of AST and ALT may be influenced by cytosolic metabolism of DBE was assessed by comparison of findings from rats treated with either 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) or 1-bromo-2-chloroethane (BCE). The extent of oxidative metabolism was diminished by the use of tetradeutero-DBE (d4-DBE), and the availability of GSH for conjugative metabolism was diminished by pretreatment of rats with L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO) prior to treatment with DBE. Our results indicate that neither DCE nor BCE provokes a liver vitamin E depletion in rats, that d4-DBE treatment hastens but does not enhance the observed hepatic vitamin E depletion by comparison to animals treated with an equimolar dose of DBE, and that BSO pretreatment prevented the hepatic vitamin E depletion observed from animals treated with DBE alone. These results indicate that hepatic vitamin E depletion is the unique sequelae to conjugation of GSH with DBE, and we suggest the reactive episulfonium ion intermediate or a macromolecular adduct of this ion derived from DBE may play a role in liver vitamin E depletion associated with exposure to DBE.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 33.1 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-bromo-2-chloroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-bromo-2-chloroethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 42 days. If released to soil, 1-bromo-2-chloroethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 34. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.1X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Bromo-2-chloroethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 1-bromo-2-chloroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 122 hours, respectively. An estimated BCF of 4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 3 and 32 years at pHs 8 and 7, respectively, indicate that hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process. Occupational exposure to 1-bromo-2-chloroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-bromo-2-chloroethane is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

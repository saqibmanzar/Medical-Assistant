Several studies have reported an increased incidence of forestomach tumors in rats and mice exposed via gavage (experimentally placing the chemical in the stomach). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified styrene oxide as a Group 2A, a probable human carcinogen.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A mode of action-based physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to predict the concentration of ST and SO in blood, liver, and the respiratory-tract tissues, particularly in terminal bronchioles (target tisue), in order to conduct interspecies extrapolations and determine the extent to which there is a pharmacokinetic basis for the observed species specificity. This PBPK model has a multicompartment description of the respiratory tract and incorporates species-specific quantitative information on respiratory-tract physiology, cellular composition, and metabolic capacity. The model is validated against multiple data sets, including blood, liver, and whole lung tissue concentration of styrene (ST) and SO following multiple routes of exposure. The trend in neoplastic incidences in mice correlated well with model-estimated SO concentration in the terminal bronchioles. The PBPK model predicts a 10-fold lower SO concentration in the terminal bronchioles in rats compared to mice, which is consistent with the observed species sensitivity to the development of respiratory-tract neoplasms. The model-based analysis suggests that humans would be expected to be 100-fold less sensitive to ST-inducted lung tumors than mice, based on pharmacokinetic differences. Pharmacodynamic factors are also expected to contribute to species sensitivity, potentially augmenting pharmacokinetics-based differences.",

R- and S-styrene oxide yielded predominantly R- and S-mandelic acid, respectively, racemic styrene oxide gave predominantly the R-enantiomer whereas styrene yielded almost racemic mandelate. The regioselectivity of mercapturic acid formation was very similar for styrene, R- and S-styrene oxide. These three species yielded a 2:1 mixture of N-acetyl-S-(1-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine (MA1) and N-acetyl-S-(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine (MA2). R-Styrene oxide gave higher conversion to mercapturic acids (28%) than the S-isomer (19% of the dose). However, R-styrene oxide yielded stereospecifically S,R-MA1 and R,R-MA2 whereas S-styrene oxide gave R,R-MA1 and S,R-MA2. Styrene yielded a mixture of diastereomeric mercapturic acids. The ratios of R,R-/S,R-isomers were 80:20 and 15:85 for MA1 and MA2, respectively. These data suggest that styrene is metabolized stereoselectively to S-styrene oxide as a major enantiomer in rat in vivo. This enantiomer has been reported to be less mutagenic than R-styrene oxide in vitro.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate blood SO, SO-hemoglobin (SO-Hb) adducts, and urinary metabolites in styrene-exposed human volunteers and to compare these results with data previously obtained for rodents. Four healthy male volunteers were exposed for 2 hr during light physical exercise to 50 ppm (13)C(8)-styrene vapor via a face mask. Levels and time profiles of styrene in exhaled air, blood, and urine (analyzed by GC) and urinary excretion patterns of mandelic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid in urine (analyzed by HPLC) were comparable to previously published volunteer studies. Maximum levels of SO in blood (measured by GC-MS) of 2.5-12.2 (average 6.7) nM were seen after 2 hr, i.e., in the first sample collected after exposure had ended. The styrene blood level in humans was about 1.5 to 2 times higher than in rats and 4 times higher than in mice for equivalent styrene exposures. In contrast the SO levels in human blood was approximately fourfold lower than in mice. The level of hydroxyphenethylvaline (determined by GC-MS-MS) in pooled blood collected after exposure was estimated as 0.3 pmol/g globin corresponding to a SO-Hb adduct increment of about 0.003 pmol/g and ppm hr. NMR analyses of urine showed that a major portion (> 95%) of the excreted (13)C-derived metabolites was derived from hydrolysis of SO, while only a small percentage of the excreted metabolites (< 5%) was derived from metabolism via phenylacetaldehyde. Signals consistent with metabolites derived from other pathways of styrene metabolism in rodents (such as glutathione conjugation with SO or ring epoxidation) were not detected.",

Styrene (ST) exposures ranged from 50 to 980 ppm (rats) and from 40 to 410 ppm (mice). SO was quantified from the effluent perfusate. Lungs of both species metabolized ST to SO. After a mathematical translation of the ex-vivo data to ventilation and perfusion conditions as they are occurring in vivo, a species comparison was carried out. At ST concentrations of up to 410 ppm, mean SO levels in mouse lungs ranged up to 0.45 nmol/g lung, about 2 times higher than in rat lungs at equal conditions of ST exposure. ... The species difference in the SO lung burden /appeared/ too small to consider the genotoxicity of SO as sufficient for explaining the fact that only mice developed lung tumors when exposed to ST. ...",

Understanding the relationship of the metabolism of styrene to its toxicity depends upon knowing the balance between the bioactivation of styrene to the epoxide by cytochromes P-450 and the detoxication of the oxide to the glycol by microsomal epoxide hydrolase. When hepatic and pulmonary microsomal preparations from non-Swiss albino (NSA) and Swiss (CD-1) mice were compared for their abilities to metabolize racemic, S- and R-styrene oxide to styrene glycol, enzymic activities were higher in liver than in lung. R-Styrene glycol formation was favored with racemic styrene oxide as the substrate. Only minor strain differences were found that could not account for the differences in reported susceptibility to styrene-induced toxicity. While the oxidation of styrene to styrene oxide was similar in male and female NSA mice, male hepatic microsomes were more active in the metabolism of the oxide to the glycol. Hepatic metabolism of styrene oxide to styrene glycol was inducible by butylated hydroxyanisole, whereas pulmonary metabolism was not. The data indicate that strain differences in susceptibility cannot be accounted for by this detoxication step, and there are sex differences in this reaction.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The apoptogenic potential of oxiranes requires knowledge of the relationship between the apoptotic threshold dose and cytotoxic dose for interpretation of DNA damage assays. This research determined the relationship between cytotoxic and apoptotic doses for seven simple oxiranes of varying structure. This relationship between cytotoxic and apoptotic thresholds was determined simultaneously in in vitro cell culture. L929 cells in log-phase growth were exposed to the oxiranes for 24 hr in 25 sq cm and then assayed fluorometrically in 96-well plates for Caspase 3. Viability was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion and loss of Caspase 3 activity. Ranked apoptotic potency was: diepoxybutane (DEB)>styrene oxide (SO)>phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE)>epichlorhydrin (EPI)>glycidol (GLY)>epoxybutane (EB)>epoxycyclohexane (ECH). Relative cytotoxicity was significantly correlated (r(s)=0.86, p=0.02) with potencies: DEB>EPI>PGE>SO>GLY>EB>ECH. These structurally-diverse, simple oxiranes were all capable of inducing apoptosis at doses several-fold below their cytotoxic concentrations. Difunctionality and aromaticity were key predictors of potency for both. Caspase 3 activity was an accurate indicator of necrosis which correlated with Trypan Blue results.",

The method is based on the quick ring-opening reaction of the epoxide groups to form halohydrins when the epoxide is reacted with hydrohalides. When the direct titration method with hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid is used, maintenance of a constant HBr titer is difficult. A variant of this method involves generating hydrogen bromide from a quaternary ammonium salt (e.g., tetraethylammonium bromide) during the titration by the action of perchloric acid in glacial acetic acid. This very reliable method can also be used for functional epoxides. Peroxides do not interfere. Other methods include titration with hydrogen chloride in various solvents. /Epoxides/",

Styrene and styrene oxide (SO) were directly measured in pentane extracts of blood from 35 reinforced plastics workers exposed to 4.7-97 ppm styrene. Using positive ion chemical ionization, styrene could be detected at levels greater than 2.5 ug/L blood and SO at levels greater than 0.05 ug/L blood. An alternative method for measurement of SO employed reaction with valine followed by derivatization with pentafluorophenyl isothiocyanate and analysis via negative ion chemical ionization GC-MS-MS (SO detection limit = 0.025 ug/L blood). The detection limits for SO by these two methods were 10-20-fold lower than gas chromatographic assays reported earlier, based upon either electron impact MS or flame ionization detection. Excellent agreement between the two SO methods was observed for standard calibration curves while moderate to good agreement was observed among selected reinforced plastics workers (n = 10). ...",

The reactive sites of human Hb towards SO were identified through characterization of alkylated tryptic peptides by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation with tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS). A procedure was set up based on this characterization, allowing Hb modification to be assessed by monitoring SO/Hb adducts using HPLC with selected ion recording (SIR) mass spectrometry. By this methodology it was also possible to compare advantages and disadvantages of presently available strategies for the measurement of Hb adducts with SO. The results obtained could most plausibly lead to the optimization of molecular dosimetry of SO adducts, and the analytical procedure described herein could be applied to the biological monitoring of styrene exposure in the workplace.",

Exposure to this sweet-smelling, colorless-to-pale straw-colored liquid may occur from its use in the manufacture of styrene glycol, beta-phenylethyl alcohol, surface coatings, and epoxy resins, and in the treatment of fibers and textiles. Effects from exposure may include skin, eye, and respiratory irritation, pulmonary edema, nausea, and central nervous system depression. Also, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified styrene-7,8-oxide as a Group 2A carcinogen (defined as an agent that is probably carcinogenic to humans). Mechanical exhaust ventilation should be used to minimize exposure. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear chemical protective clothing and a self-contained breathing apparatus. Smoking, drinking, and eating should be prohibited in styrene-7,8-oxide work areas. Styrene-7,8-oxide must be moderately heated before ignition will occur. For fires involving styrene-7,8-oxide, extinguish with water spray, which acts by lowering the substance to below its flash point. Styrene-7,8-oxide should be stored in unbreakable, watertight containers, away from heat and sources of ignition. Before implementing land disposal of styrene-7,8-oxide waste, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

The space between primary & secondary container should be filled with absorbent material, which would withstand chem attack from the carcinogen & is sufficient to absorb the entire contents of the primary container in the event of breakage or leakage. Each secondary container should then be enclosed in a strong outer box. The space between the secondary container & the outer box should be filled with an appropriate quantity of shock-absorbent material.

These effects may result from single or repeated contact with undiluted material and with solutions as dilute as 1%.

DNA damage was assessed in peripheral blood leukocytes (WBCs) by the comet assay. Polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferase genes (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1) and the gene encoding microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX) were characterized to assess their possible modifying role in styrene metabolism and subsequent DNA damage. Exposed workers showed significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to controls. Among workers, the GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms significantly affected comet parameters. Subjects bearing a GSTM1pos genotype showed a significantly higher proportion of damaged nuclei compared to people lacking GSTM1-1 expression (GSTM1null), whereas GSTT1pos workers showed significantly lower DNA damage than GSTT1null individuals. Styrene-7,8-oxide (SO)-induced DNA damage was assessed in vitro in WBCs isolated from the healthy controls. A clear dose-response relationship at micromolar doses of SO was found for the whole group. WBCs collected from subjects bearing the homozygous wildtype GSTP1 genotype showed a significant protection compared to cells from subjects bearing at least one GSTP1 variant allele. The field survey confirms that styrene exposure is associated with increased DNA damage and indicates a modulating role for GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes. In vitro experiments suggest that the extent of SO-induced DNA strand breaks depends, at least in part, on interindividual differences in GSH-conjugation capabilities.",

Styrene workplace concentration significantly correlated with styrene concentration in blood, exhaled air and urinary mandelic acid. Hemoglobin and O(6)-styrene oxide (SO)-guanine DNA adducts were significantly higher in exposed subjects as compared to controls and correlated with exposure parameters. In styrene-exposed workers 1-SO-adenine DNA adducts were detected (2.6 per 10+9 dNp), while in controls these adducts were below the detection limit. 1-SO-adenine adduct levels were affected by both acute and cumulative exposure (P=0.001, F=86.0 and P=0.017, F=59.0, respectively) and associated with cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) polymorphisms (R(2)=0.442). Mutant frequencies (MF) at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus appeared to accumulate with exposure over time and were associated with glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) polymorphism. DNA repair capacity increased with the exposure, except for the group exposed to the highest styrene concentration. In this particular group, increased DNA repair capacity to remove oxidative DNA damage was found.",

In humans, styrene metabolism involves oxidation by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) to styrene-7,8-oxide, an epoxide thought to be responsible for the genotoxic effects of styrene exposure, and detoxification by means of epoxide hydrolase (mEH) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). The objective of this study was to investigate if genetic polymorphisms of metabolic enzymes modulate the level of urinary styrene metabolites and styrene oxide adducts with N-terminal valine of human globin (SO-Hb) in 75 workers occupationally exposed to styrene and 77 unexposed controls. The mean air concentration of styrene in the breathing zone of workers (30.4 ppm) was higher than the threshold limit value of 20 ppm recommended by the ACGIH and the biological exposure index adopted by the ACGIH for exposure to styrene prior to the next shift (MA+PGA = 400 mg/g creatinine) was exceeded, indicating that styrene exposure for this group of workers was higher than recommended. A highly significant correlation was observed between styrene concentration in the breathing zone and the MA+PGA in urine of workers (r = 0.85, P<0.001). The levels of SO-Hb adducts in exposed workers were significantly increased as compared with controls, although no difference was observed between subjects stratified as high and medium exposure categories based on MA+PGA excretion. Regarding the effect of the genetic polymorphisms /it was/ found that the level of SO-Hb adducts might be modulated by the predicted mEH enzymatic activity in the exposed workers. From /the data it was concluded/that SO-Hb adduct measurement is a complementary method to MA+PG measurement for assessing exposure to styrene at occupational and environmental levels, which reflects a more extensive exposure period.",

In this study, the nasal tissues of mice exposed to 40 and 160 ppm styrene 6 hr/day for 3 days had a number of degenerative changes including atrophy of the olfactory mucosa and loss of normal cellular organization. Pretreatment of mice with 5-phenyl-1-pentyne, an inhibitor of both CYP2F2 and CYP2E1 completely prevented the development of a nasal lesion on exposure to styrene establishing that a metabolite of styrene, probably styrene oxide, is responsible for the observed nasal toxicity. Comparisons of the cytochrome P-450 mediated metabolism of styrene to its oxide, and subsequent metabolism of the oxide by epoxide hydrolases and glutathione S-transferases in nasal tissues in vitro, have provided an explanation for the increased sensitivity of the mouse to styrene. Whereas cytochrome P-450 metabolism of styrene is similar in rats and mice, the rat is able to metabolize styrene oxide at higher rates than the mouse thus rapidly detoxifying this electrophilic metabolite. Metabolism of styrene to its oxide could not be detected in human nasal tissues in vitro, but the same tissues did have epoxide hydrolase and glutathione S-transferase activities, and were able to metabolize styrene oxide efficiently.",

Pneumotoxicity caused by styrene or styrene oxide was measured by elevations in the release of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), while hepatotoxicity was measured by increases in serum sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) in non-Swiss Albino (Hsd:NSA) mice. Intraperitoneal administration of styrene at doses of 500-1000 mg/kg caused consistent dose-dependent increases in both sets of biomarkers with the hepatic effect appearing earlier than the pulmonary effect. Pyridine, phenobarbital, and beta-naphthoflavone, inducers of CYP2E1, CYP2B, and CYP1A, respectively, increased the toxicity of styrene. Pyridine and phenobarbital treatments increased mortality due to styrene. Styrene oxide exists in two enantiomeric forms: (R)- and (S)-styrene oxide, and the differential toxicities of the two enantiomers and racemic styrene oxide were compared. In all studies, (R)-styrene oxide caused greater toxicity than the (S) enantiomer, especially in the liver. Trichloropropene oxide, an epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, was used to inhibit styrene oxide detoxification and increased its hepatotoxicity, while buthionine sulfoxamine, a glutathione depletor, did not.",

This is considered to be due to the bioactivation of styrene to styrene oxide by cytochromes P450, principally CYP2E1 and CYP2F2. If so, one would expect CYP2E1 knockout mice to be less susceptible to styrene-induced toxicity than wild-type mice. However, previous in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated little difference in the metabolism of styrene to styrene oxide between wild-type and CYP2E1 knockout mice. These findings would suggest that there should be no difference in the toxic responses to styrene between these two strains. To determine which of these possibilities was correct, styrene (600 mg/kg) or styrene oxide (300 mg/kg) was administered ip 24 hr prior to measurement of serum sorbitol dehydrogenase as a biomarker of hepatotoxicity or lactate dehydrogenase activity, protein, and cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as biomarkers for pneumotoxicity. Styrene was more hepatotoxic in the wild-type mice than in the knockout mice suggesting CYP2E1 activity is important. Strain differences were not observed with styrene oxide indicating no difference in intrinsic susceptibility. For lung, the response was similar in both strains to both styrene and styrene oxide supporting the idea that CYP2F2 is important in the bioactivation of styrene in this tissue and that there is no strain difference in susceptibility to the active metabolite.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.3 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates styrene-7,8-oxide will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase styrene-7,8-oxide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.2 days. Styrene-7,8-oxide does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, styrene-7,8-oxide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 53. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Hydrolytic half-lives of 0.17, 28 and 40.9 hours have been reported for styrene-7,8-oxide at pH 3, 7, and 9, respectively. Hydrolysis is likely to be a more important fate than volatilization from moist soils or transport through soil, particularly in acidic soils. Styrene-7,8-oxide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based its vapor pressure. Styrene-7,8-oxide reached 80-82% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test, suggesting that biodegradation is likely to be an important fate process for styrene-7,8-oxide; however, the test results might be for the hydrolysis product, styrene glycol. If released into water, styrene-7,8-oxide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.7 and 23 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3.5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is likely to be a more important fate than volatilization from water surfaces and bioconcentration, particularly in acidic water. Occupational exposure to styrene-7,8-oxide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where styrene-7,8-oxide is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of styrene-7,8-oxide from moist soil surfaces is  expected(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.3 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 3,000 mg/L(2). Styrene-7,8-oxide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.3 mm Hg(2). Hydrolytic half-lives of 0.17, 28 and 40.9 hours have been reported for styrene-7,8-oxide at pH 3, 7, and 9, respectively(4). Hydrolysis is likely to be a more important fate than volatilization from moist soil or transport through soils, particularly in acidic soils(SRC). Styrene-7,8-oxide (100 mg/L) reached 80-82% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum (30 mg/L) in the Japanese MITI test(5), suggesting that biodegradation is likely to be an important fate process for styrene-7,8-oxide; however, the test results might be for the hydrolysis product, styrene glycol(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected for styrene-7,8-oxide(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.3 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 3,000 mg/L(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 64 hours and 23 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 3.5(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.61(5) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Hydrolytic half-lives of 0.17, 28 and 40.9 hours have been reported for styrene-7,8-oxide at pH 3, 7, and 9, respectively(7). Hydrolysis is likely to be a more important fate than volatilization from water or bioconcentration in aquatic organisms, particularly in acidic water(SRC). Styrene-7,8-oxide (100 mg/L) reached 80-82% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum (30 mg/L) in the Japanese MITI test(8), suggesting that biodegradation is likely to be an important fate process for styrene-7,8-oxide; however, the test results might be for the hydrolysis product, styrene glycol(SRC).",

Vapor-phase styrene-7,8-oxide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.2 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.1X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Styrene-7,8-oxide does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that styrene-7,8-oxide is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 64 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 23 days(SRC). Styrene-7,8-oxide's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Hydrolytic half-lives of 0.17, 28 and 40.9 hours have been reported for styrene-7,8-oxide at pH 3, 7, and 9, respectively(3). Hydrolysis is likely to be a more important fate than volatilization from water or moist soil surfaces, particularly in acidic water or soils(SRC). Styrene-7,8-oxide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure of 0.3 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C(1).",

Air concentration during the manufacture of reinforced polyester plastics in Norway ranged from <0.02 to 0.6 mg/cu m(2).

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The negative slopes of these plots allow a ranking of the effectiveness of the blocking agent. Several of the pyrroles have been found to be much more effective than establishing blocking agents such as ascorbic acid. The following order blocking ability has been determined: 2,5-dimethylpyrrole = 1-benzyl-2,5-dimethylpyrroleic acid = 1,2-phenylenediamine = pyrrole > 1,2,5-tribenzylpyrrole = 1-benzylpyrrole = octamethylporphine hydrazine = 2,5-diphenylpyrrolecarboxylic acid.

The epsilon-amino groups of lysyl residues react with 2,5-hexanedione forming pyrrole adducts, followed by pyrrole-mediated protein crosslinking. Both reaction steps have been proposed as mechanisms causing neurofilament accumulation and acceleration of transport. In order to assess the importance of steps on neurofilament transport, we compared transport in the optic system of rats exposed to 2,5-hexanedione and 3-acetyl-2,5-hexanedione, a non-toxic analog of 2,5-hexanedione which forms pyrroles but does not crosslink proteins. Control, 2,5-hexanedione-treated, and 3-acetyl-2,5-hexanedione-treated rats received intraoptic injections of (35S)-methionine and were exposed to saline, 2,5-hexanedione, or 3-acetyl-2,5-hexanedione by intraperitoneal injections before and during the period of neurofilament transport. Neurofilament triplet proteins in the optic nerve and tract were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. The rate of neurofilament transport was accelerated in 2,5-hexanedione-treated animals over that of controls. However, despite higher levels of protein-bound pyrroles in 3-acetyl-2,5-hexanedione-treated animals, the rate of transport was indistinguishable from that of controls. These findings indicate that pyrrole formation alone is not sufficient to cause acceleration of neurofilament transport.",

SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses of hepatic cytosol prepared from rats treated with pyrazine revealed the induction of class alpha (Ya and Yc) and mu (Yb) bands with a corresponding 2.4-fold increase in metabolic activity using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate. A new class alpha band migrating in the region of the Yc band was observed in the SDS-PAGE and detected in the immunoblot of cytosol from pyrrole-treated rats, whereas treatment with 4-picoline, imidazole, or piperidine failed to alter the expression of the major classes of glutathione S-transferase isozymes in this species. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses of rabbit hepatic cytosol revealed a unique species-dependent difference in the expression of glutathione S-transferases. While phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene induce class alpha and mu glutathione S-transferase expression in rat hepatic cytosol, one of the most interesting observations was that neither of these agents stimulated glutathione S-transferase expression in the rabbit. Immunoblot analysis of cytosol isolated from 4-picoline-treated rabbits using glutathione S-transferase class alpha-specific IgG showed the appearance of a novel class alpha 28-kDa glutathione S-transferase band and the concomitant disappearance of a class alpha 29-kDa glutathione S-transferase band. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses showed that treatment of rabbits with pyrrole,pyrazine, imidazole, or piperidine resulted in the disappearance of this class alpha 29-kDa glutathione S-transferase band with no detectable expression of the class alpha 28-kDa glutathione S-transferase band; the level of the class alpha 29-kDa band was unaffected by pyridine treatment. In contrast, immunoblot analyses of hepatic cytosol revealed that a 25.5-kDa class mu glutathione S-transferase band disappeared following treatment with pyridine, but was unaffected by treatment other than nitrogen heterocycles. The Vmax of glutathione conjugation to the substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene decreased by 52, 36, 59, 41, 37, and 32% in hepatic cytosol isolated from 4-picoline, pyrrole-, pyridine, pyrazine-, imidazole-, and piperidine-treated rabbits, respectively. The results suggest that nitrogen heterocycles differ in their ability to modulate glutathione-S-transferase isozyme expression in rat and rabbit hepatic tissue and that rabbit hepatic glutathione S-transferases are refractory to induction by agents such as pyrazine, phenobarbital, or 3-methylcholanthrene and hence these xenobiotics do not appear to be bifunctional inducers in this species.",

Incubation of U-937 with the mutagens for 12 hr at approx 37 \u00b0C in the serum-free medium reduced the viability of the U-937 cells. Especially, 3-amino-1-dimethyl-5H-pyridol(4,3-b)indole and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine reduced it markedly. 3-Amino-1-dimethyl-5H-pyridol(4,3-b)indole, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-acrylamide and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural were also found to decrease the formation of formazan in the U-937 cells. All the mutagens slightly increased the activity of a drug-metabolizing enzyme, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, in the cells. They also caused a variation of such enzyme activities in the cells as glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, catalase and alkaline phosphatase. Leakage of the activities of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase from the U-937 cells into the culture medium was also observed, especially when the cells were treated with high concentration of 3-amino-1-dimethyl-5H-pyridol(4,3-b)indole, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-acrylamide. No marked effect of 3-amino-1-dimethyl-5H-pyridol(4,3-b)indole and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine on the activity of beta-galactosidase was observed.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 8.35 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pyrrole will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase pyrrole will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 days. Pyrrole does not absorb light in the environmental UV spectrum, and is not expected to directly photolyze. If released to soil, pyrrole is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 61. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.80X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Pyrrole may potentially volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, pyrrole is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Pyrrole does not readily undergo biodegradation in water unless there exists bacteria that have had previous exposure to pyrrole. Given this need for acclimation, the decomposition of pyrrole may be very slow. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 42 hours and 368 hours, respectively. An estimated BCF of 2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to pyrrole may occur through inhalation, and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pyrrole is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to pyrrole through the consumption of food and use of creosote. (SRC)",

Volatilization of pyrrole from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). The potential for volatilization of pyrrole from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 8.35 mm Hg(5). Pyrrole does not readily undergo biodegradation in water unless there exists bacteria that have had previous exposure to pyrrole. Given this need for acclimation, the decomposition of pyrrole may be very slow(6).",

Volatilization from water sources is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.80X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). Volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 42 hrs and 368 hrs, respectively(SRC), using an estimation method(3). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 2(3,SRC) from a log Kow of 0.75(2) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Experiments have shown that pyrrole is actually degraded by gasoline-adapted ground water cultures when present as a single substrate. Adaption time was 480 hrs and degradation time was 600 hrs(6). Pyrrole was not degraded in a mixture of compounds in water after 1100-1300 hrs at 10 \u00b0C and at a concentration of 0.2-1 mg/l(6).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Experiments have shown that pyrrole is actually degraded by gasoline-adapted ground water cultures when present as a single substrate. Adaption time was 480 hrs and degradation time was 600 hrs. Pyrrole inhibits benzene biodegradation strongly even at pyrrole concentrations of 100-200 ug/l(1). Degradation of pyrrole seems to be enhanced with the concomitant degradation of other compounds in an aqueous environment. No degradation of pyrrole was observed under denitrifying conditions during 846 days of incubation(2). In an aerobic enrichment culture that originated from groundwater at a creosote-contaminated aquifer in Fredensbury Denmark, pyrrole was completely removed after 49 days. It is suggested that microorganisms have to adapt to pyrrole before they can begin to degrade it and that the lag phase can be very long(3).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

However, once coal gasification began, pyrrole was detected at 208 ppm in Hanna, Wyoming and 111 ppm Gillete, Wyoming. Pyrrole was not detected from low-Btu gasification of Rosebud coal but was detected at 23 ppm from an in situ oil shale process (limits of detection were 0.1 ppb)(1). Two retort wastewaters selected for study were produced from January to May, 1979 in the modified in situ retort 6 at the Occidental Oil Shale, Inc. facility at Logan Wash, CO. In the condensate retort water, 4.9 mg/l of pyrrole was detected while no pyrrole was detected at the process retort water (detection limits not specified)(2). Pyrrole was detected from shale oil wastewaters used to cool hot spent shale, both in gas condensate water and process retort water units not specified(3).",

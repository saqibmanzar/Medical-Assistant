PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Another study showed that acetylcarnitine increased glucose disposal in type 2 diabetic patients through possibly increasing the activity of glycogen synthase.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Additionally several studies have found that separate from its metabolic role, acetylcarnitine has neuromodulatory, neurotrophic, and neuroprotective effects that most likely are involved in its positive effects in neurological diseases. In its role in treating male infertility, acetylcarnitine increases the active movement of sperm cells. One study has also mentioned a role for acetylcarnitine as an antioxidant. The study found that through the receptor, tyrosine kinase A, acetylcarnitine was able to decrease the production of free radicals, peroxidation of lipids, and oxidation of proteins as well as decrease glutathione levels and increase thioredoxin.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Acetal has been identified in drinking water, ground water, surface water, advanced treatment water, and in leachate samples. It has also been detected in orange essences, as a volatile component of pork, beef, and cognac, and in human breath samples. If released to soil, acetal will have high mobility. Volatilization of acetal may be important from moist and dry soil surfaces. Insufficient data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of acetal in soil or water. If released to water, acetal would not adsorb to suspended solids and sediment, based on an estimated Koc value of 68. Acetal would volatilize from water surfaces with estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake of 13 hours and 7.3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 2.6 suggests that acetal will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. Acetals are easily cleaved by dilute acids but are extremely resistant to hydrolysis by bases. Therefore, hydrolysis of acetal is expected to be an important fate process in water. If released to the atmosphere, acetal will exist in the vapor phase. Vapor-phase acetal is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 19.6 hours. (SRC)",

Acetal would volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.75X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values for vapor pressure(4) and water solubility(5). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hours and 7.3 days, respectively(3,SRC). An estimated BCF value of 2.6(3,SRC), from an experimental log Kow(2), suggests that acetal will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC) according to a recommended classification scheme(6). Acetals are easily cleaved by dilute acids by the SN1 mechanism(7). However, they are extremely resistant to hydrolysis by bases(7).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The mutagenicity of the plant activated mPDA product required that O-acetyltransferase (OAT) be expressed by the S. typhimurium tester strain. However, the paraoxon dependent mutagenic synergy was observed using the direct acting arylamine metabolite, 2AAAF, with strains YG1024, TA98 and TA98/1,8-DNP6 regardless of their OAT activity. This mutagenic synergy is dependent upon the presence of an activated acetylated form of the arylamine.

Bodyweight, feed consumption, clinical signs, functional observational battery performance, fore-, and hindlimb grip strength, foot splay, and motor activity were assessed prior to treatment (baseline values), and at 1 hour, 24 hours, and 4 days post-treatment. Toxicity was demonstrated at all dose levels and generally to a greater extent in females. Females at the 150 and 300 mg/kg dose level, one and eight rats, respectively, were found dead prior to scheduled sacrifice, death occurring from 2-4 days after treatment. All study lethalities were found with pallor and staining. Significant weight loss within one day of dosing and persisting throughout Day 4 was common to 150 and 300 mg/kg treatment groups, while food consumption was adversely affected in a dose-related manner. A rebounding of food consumption and bodyweights was noted thereafter. Clinical signs were apparent from day of dosing and included dose-related pallor in females, and irregular head movements, coloration of urine and a tip-toe gait in males and females. The functional observational battery revealed significant general malaise, postural changes, and palpebral closure. High-dose females also showed diminished arousal. Measurements of fore- and hindlimb grip strength and foot splay were not indicative of a neurotoxicity at any treatment level. Motor activity was significantly depressed following treatment in all treatment groups relative to control (p </= .01), exhibiting a dose-related rate of recovery in the respective groups.

A functional observational battery and motor activity tests were conducted prior to dosing and at weeks 4, 8, and 13 during treatment. Male rats only exhibited minimal dose-related reductions in both horizontal (10 and 20 mg/kg groups) and vertical motor activity (20 mg/kg group) during treatment weeks 4 and 8 relative to controls. Study authors attributed these findings, which were not statistically significant, to general malaise characterized by lethargy rather than a direct effect of treatment on the central nervous system. Neuropathological evaluation at termination of study yielded no anomalies within the nervous system or skeletal muscle.",

If released to the atmosphere, 1,3-benzenediamine is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere based on an extrapolated vapor pressure of 2.1X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 1,3-benzenediamine is rapidly degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life 1.9 hours). 1,3-Benzenediamine absorbs light in the environmental spectrum, which suggests a potential for direct photolysis in the environment. If released to soil, 1,3-benzenediamine is expected to have very high mobility based on an estimated Koc of 16. However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group; therefore, mobility may be much lower in some soils. 1,3-Benzenediamine is not expected to volatilize from wet or dry soil surfaces, based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-9 atm-cu m/mol and this compound's extrapolated vapor pressure, respectively. Limited data indicate 1,3-benzenediamine may be resistant to biodegradation in soil. If released into water, volatilization of 1,3-benzenediamine is not expected to occur, based on its estimated Henry's Law constant. 1,3-Benzenediamine may exist partially in the ionized form at environmental pH's based on pKa values of 2.65 and 4.88 at 25 \u00b0C. Volatilization of the ionized form is not expected to be an important fate process. The potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is expected to be low based on measured BCF values ranging from 1.3 to 24 in carp. Based on its structure, aromatic amine, 1,3-benzenediamine may adsorb strongly to suspended solids and sediment in water. As a class, aromatic amines react relatively rapidly in sunlit natural water via reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals and peroxy radicals (typical half-lives for peroxy radical and hydroxyl radical reactions are on the order of 19 and 30 sunlight hours, respectively). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process. Aqueous screening studies indicate 1,3-benzenediamine may be susceptible to biodegradation by acclimated activated sludge. Occupational exposure to 1,3-benzenediamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,3-benzenediamine is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 1,3-benzenediamine via dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5); therefore, mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). Volatilization of 1,3-benzenediamine is not expected to be important from moist soil surfaces(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), from its extrapolated vapor pressure, 2.1X10-3 mm Hg(6), and measured water solubility, 2.4X10+5 mg/l(7). 1,3-Benzenediamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based on its extrapolated vapor pressure(6). Limited biodegradation data indicate 1,3-benzenediamine may be resistant to biodegradation in soil; soil microflora did not cleave the benzene ring of 1,3-benzenediamine in 64 days(8).",

However, aromatic amines are recognized as having a strong affinity to organic carbon, suggesting that this compound may bind strongly to suspended organic material in water(4,5). 1,3-Benzenediamine is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its extrapolated vapor pressure, 2.1X10-3 mm Hg(6), and measured water solubility, 2.4X10+5 mg/l(7). 1,3-Benzenediamine may exist partially in the ionized form at environmental pH's based on pKa values of 2.65 and 4.88 at 25 \u00b0C(8). Volatilization of the ionized form is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(9), BCF values of 1.3 to 4.6 and <1.6 to 24 measured for 1,3-benzenediamine in carp at 2 and 0.2 mg/l, respectively(10), suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 1,3-Benzenediamine in the water column may be susceptible to significant photooxidation via hydroxyl and peroxy radicals; half-lives for these photooxidations may be on the order of 19-30 sunlight hours(11). Aqueous screening studies indicate 1,3-benzenediamine may be susceptible to microbial degradation(SRC); 60% degradation was observed after 5 days using an acclimated activated sludge inoculum(12). 1,3-Benzenediamine was reported to be toxic to 3 unacclimated sludges at concns greater than 50 ppm(13).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.9 hours at an atmospheric concn of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1,SRC). 1,3-Benzenediamine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups to hydrolyze(2). As a class, aromatic amines react relatively rapidly in sunlit natural water via reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals and peroxy radicals(3); typical half-lives for peroxy radical and hydroxyl radical reactions are on the order of 19 and 30 sunlight hours, respectively(3). 1,3-Benzenediamine absorbs light in the environmental spectra(4), which suggests a potential for direct photolysis in the environment(SRC).

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

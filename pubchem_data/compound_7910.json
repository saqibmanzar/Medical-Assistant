When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The effect of 4-methyl-2-pentanol and 4-hydroxymethyl isobutyl ketone, two major metabolites of methyl isobutyl ketone on these models of cholestasis /was examined/. Dosages varying from 1.88 to 15 mmol/kg 4-methyl-2-pentanol or 4-hydroxymethyl isobutyl ketone were administered once, 18 hr prior to the administration of a cholestatic manganese bilirubin combination. The cholestatic effect of the manganese bilirubin combination was enhanced with dosages of 4-methyl-2-pentanol of 3.75 mmol/kg and larger. Daily pretreatment for 3 days resulted in an increased response to the cholestatic challenges of either mangenese bilirubin or manganese alone. 4-Methyl-2-pentanol administered repetitively was a better potentiator than 4-hydroxymethyl isobutyl ketone with the manganese bilirubin model of cholestasis. However, with manganese alone, 4-hydroxymethyl isobutyl ketone proved to be more effective. 4-Methyl-2-pentanol and 4-hydroxymethyl isobutyl ketone per se were devoid of cholestatic properties, since the bile flow measured prior to the cholestatic challenge was not decreased and in some cases was significantly greater than that of vehicle-pretreated animals. These results show that methyl isobutyl ketone metabolites can potentiate the cholestatic form of hepatotoxicity.",

It may be formed naturally as it has been found in the volatiles from mountain Beaufort cheese. If released to soil, it will be expected to exhibit high to very high mobility in soil based upon an estimated Koc; it may, therefore, leach through soil to groundwater. It will not hydrolyze in moist soil, but it may be subject to volatilization from near surface soil based upon estimated rates for its volatilization from water. It may be subject to biodegradation in soil based upon the rapid biodegradation observed in laboratory aqueous screening tests using sewage and activated sludge inoculums. If released to water, it will not be expected to adsorb to sediment and suspended particulate matter or to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms based upon estimated Koc and BCF. It will not be expected to hydrolyze or directly photolyze. It may be subject to biodegradation in natural waters based upon the rapid biodegradation observed in laboratory aqueous screening tests using sewage and activated sludge inoculum. It will be subject to volatilization from surface waters based upon half-lives of 23 hr for volatilization from a model river one meter deep flowing 1 m/sec with a wind velocity of 3 m/sec and 10.6 days for volatilization from a model pond. If released to the atmosphere, it can be expected to exist mainly in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere based upon its vapor pressure. The estimated half-life for the reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals is 2.3 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm, based upon a measured rate constant. 4-Methyl-2-pentanol has been rated a moderately reactive compound with respect to ozone formations as observed in smog chamber tests. It will not be expected to directly photolyze in the atmosphere. Any general population exposure occurs mainly through the oral ingestion of contaminated drinking water and foods, such as certain cheeses, and through the inhalation of contaminated ambient air. Minor exposure may occur through dermal contact with contaminated water. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation of contaminated air and dermal contact with solutions containing the compound. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

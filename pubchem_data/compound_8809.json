When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

NaOH (or Na2CO3) /sodium carbonate/ can also be added to the mixture to help speed the reactions when calcium oxide is used as the main alkali. The amt of calcium oxide or sodium hydroxide to use depends on the amt of pesticide to be disposed of and, to some extent, the concn of active ingredient in the pesticide and the actual chemical nature of the active ingredient. A practical guideline, in the absence of specific directions, is to use an approx vol or wt of alkali from one-half of to the same as that of the pesticide. For dilute formulations, such as a 1% soln or dust, the amt of calcium oxide or sodium hydroxide can be reduced by one-half. For very concn pesticides (over 80% active ingredient) the amt of calcium oxide or sodium hydroxide can be doubled, but the concn should be mixed first with water (or soapy water) before reaction with the alkali. For safety, a preliminary test should be made in which very small amt of the pesticide and alkali are mixed and observed briefly to make sure it does not react too vigorously. Sizeable quantities of pesticides can be disposed of in several smaller batches, rather than all at once, for added safety. Recommendable methods: Incineration, hydrolysis, landfill, & discharge to sewer. Peer review: Small amt when hydrolized can be flushed to sewer or landfilled. Large amt should be incinerated in a unit with effluent gas scrubbing. (Peer-review conclusions of an IRPTC expert consultation (May 1985))",

Ingestions of these herbicides are likely to be followed by vomiting and diarrhea due to their irritant properties. Management depends on: (1) the best estimate of the quantity ingested, (2) time elapsed since ingestion, and (3) the clinical status of the subject. Activated charcoal is probably effective in limiting irritant effects and reducing absorption of most or all of these herbicides. Aluminum hydroxide antacids may be useful in neutralizing the irritant actions of more acidic agents. Sorbitol should be given to induce catharsis if bowel sounds are present and if spontaneous diarrhea has not already commenced. Dehydration and electrolyte disturbances may be severe enough to require oral or intravenous fluids. ... If large amounts of herbicide have been ingested and the patient is seen within an hour of the ingestion, gastrointestinal decontamination should be considered ... . If the amount of ingested herbicides was small, if effective emesis has already occurred, or if treatment is delayed, administer activated charcoal and sorbitol by mouth. /Other herbicides/",

Controls consisted of 100 rats/sex/strain fed a diet containing no aramite. Tumor incidence data were not reported by sex. CFN rats showed a dose-related increased incidence of neoplastic nodules; 5/180, 3/93, 10/90 and 22/96 in the 0, 100, 200 or 400 ppm groups, respectively. No liver carcinomas were observed in CFN rats, but the incidences of bile duct adenomas were 0/180, 2/93, 1/200 and 2/96 in the control, 100, 200 and 400 ppm groups, respectively. It is unclear whether these rats also had neoplastic liver nodules. Only Sprague-Dawley rats dying after 1 year were examined. High mortality (about 60%) (unrelated to treatment) in the ninth and tenth months due to respiratory infections in the Sprague-Dawley rats precluded evaluation for late-developing tumors. Respiratory infections also caused many deaths in CFN rats (about 20%) (unrelated to treatment) after 6 months.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.2X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates aramite will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase aramite will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hours. Particulate-phase aramite will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. In hexane solution, aramite does not absorb UV irradiation above 290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, aramite is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2.0X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data for aramite are not available. If released into water, aramite is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 1000 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Aramite contains functional groups that may be susceptible to hydrolysis; however, insufficient data are available to predict the relative importance or occurrence of chemical or biological degradation processes in water. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since aramite has been discontinued and currently has little commercial interest. In the past, aramite was applied directly to citrus fruits as an acaricide and exposure to this compound was primarily through sprays and dusts in the field where it was applied. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

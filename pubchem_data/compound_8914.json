PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Intermediate-chain alcohols (pentanol to octanol) caused channel currents to fluctuate between the fully open and closed state level so that openings occurred in bursts interrupted by brief gaps ... The number of gaps within a burst was dependent on alcohol concentration whereas gap duration was independent of concentration but increased with increasing chain length of the alcohol up to octanol. Nonanol and decanol reduced the mean duration of bursts of openings but did not cause an increase in the number of short closed intervals within a burst. Beyond decanol there was a decline in the ability of the n-alcohols to affect channel function. A saturated solution of undecanol (0.07 mM) reduced the mean open time by 33 + or - 17%, whereas a saturated solution of dodecanol had no significant effect. The current integral per burst was reduced by all the n-alcohols between pentanol and undecanol. The IC50s were as follows: hexanol, 0.53 + or - 0.14 mM; heptanol, 0.097 + or - 0.02 mM; octanol, 0.04 mM and nonanol, 0.16 + or - 0.035 mM ... Blocking rate constants (k+B) for pentanol through to nonanol were calculated to be between 2.8 and 5.7 X 10(6) /M/sec ... Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD), calculated from the blocking and unblocking rate constants (KD = k-B/k+B), decreased with increasing chain length from 8 mM for pentanol to 0.15 mM for octanol. The standard free energy per methylene group for adsorption to the site of action was calculated to be about -3.3 kJ/mol.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.27X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-nonanol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-nonanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 28 hours. If released to soil, 1-nonanol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 290. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.08X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Nonanol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 1-Nonanol has been shown to biodegrade in mixed culture and sludge screening tests. If released into water, 1-nonanol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation of 1-nonanol has been shown to occur in freshwater grab samples. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.6 days and 15 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 160 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1-nonanol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-nonanol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-nonanol via ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other consumer products in which 1-nonanol is used as a fragrance.

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It sets up criteria for the classification of chemicals for physical-chemical, health, and environmental hazards of chemical substances and mixtures and sets up standardized hazard information to facilitate global trade of chemicals.  Please note that obsolete codes are added in this classification for completeness purposes, as they are still in use. Any obsolete codes are annotated as such.",

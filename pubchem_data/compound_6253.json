Cytarabine is converted to the triphosphate form within the cell and then competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA.  Because the arabinose sugar sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule within DNA, DNA replication ceases, specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle.  This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and repair. (NCI04)",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Most commonly encountered is deficiency of deoxycytidine kinase ... Another mechanism of resistance is marked expansion of the dCTP pool due to incr CTP synthase activity ... The incr concn of intracellular dCTP presumably can block the actions of AraCTP on DNA synthesis. Other mechanisms include incr cytidine deaminase activity and reduced affinity of DNA polymerase for AraCTP ... While specific steps in AraC activation and degradation exert a strong influence ... the cellular response to AraC-mediated DNA damage also governs whether or not the genotoxic insult results in cell death ... Overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in leukemic blasts have been associated with in vitro resistance to AraC-mediated apoptosis ... Phosphorylation of DNA-damage response factors or transcription factors also may influence the cellular response to AraC toxic insult. Recent studies have shown that phosphorylation of Bcl-2 or the AP-1 transcription factor is associated with AraC resistance in human myeloid leukemia cell lines in vitro ... At the clinical level, AraC resistance is poorly understood.",

Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the \"S\" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Cytarabine is metabolized intracellularly into its active triphosphate form (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate). This metabolite then damages DNA by multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of alpha-DNA polymerase, inhibition of DNA repair through an effect on beta-DNA polymerase, and incorporation into DNA. The latter mechanism is probably the most important. Cytotoxicity is highly specific for the S phase of the cell cycle.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

After the initial distribution phase, more than 80% of the drug in plasma is present as ara-U. In the CSF, only minimal amounts of cytarabine are converted to ara-U because of low CSF concentrations of cytidine deaminase. Intracellularly, cytarabine is metabolized by deoxycytidine kinase and other nucleotide kinases to cytarabine triphosphate, the active metabolite of the drug. Cytarabine triphosphate is inactivated by a pyrimidine nucleoside deaminase, which produces the uracil derivative.",

In contrast to systemically administered cytarabine, which is rapidly metabolized to ara-U, conversion to ara-U in the CSF is negligible after intrathecal administration because of the significantly lower cytidine deaminase activity in the CNS tissues and CSF. The CSF clearance rate of cytarabine is similar to the CSF bulk flow rate of 0.24 mL/min. /Cytarabine liposome injection/",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Cytarabine is cytotoxic to a wide variety of proliferating mammalian cells in culture. It exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S-phase) and under certain conditions blocking the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S-phase. Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, it appears that cytarabine acts through the inhibition of DNA polymerase. A limited, but significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also been reported.",

Cytarabine is a cell cycle phase-specific antineoplastic agent, affecting cells only during the S-phase of cell division. Intracellularly, cytarabine is converted into cytarabine-5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP), which is the active metabolite. The mechanism of action is not completely understood, but it appears that ara-CTP acts primarily through inhibition of DNA polymerase. Incorporation into DNA and RNA may also contribute to cytarabine cytotoxicity. Cytarabine is cytotoxic to a wide variety of proliferating mammalian cells in culture. /Cytarabine liposome injection/",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled.

The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

Biohazard cabinetry is, however, designed for the handling of infectious agents, not hazardous chemicals. ... Based on design, ease of use, and cost considerations, Class II contained-vertical-flow biohazard cabinetry is currently recommended for use in preparing sterile doses of hazardous drugs. Class II cabinetry design and performance specifications are defined in NSF Standard 49. Biological safety cabinets selected for use with hazardous drugs should meet NSF Standard 49 specifications to ensure the maximum protection from these engineering controls. /Antineoplastic agents/"

The complete remission rate is less than 35% in patients over 65 years of age, due in part to an age-related increase of myelotoxicity. The other important adverse effect of standard-dose cytarabine is gastrointestinal toxicity, especially oral mucositis, diarrhea, intestinal ulceration, ileus and subsequent Gram-negative septicaemia. Idiosyncratic reactions like exanthema, fever and elevation of hepatic enzymes are relatively frequent, but do not represent therapeutic problems. Intermittent high-dose cytarabine (3 g/sq m in 8 to 12 doses) is extremely myelosuppressive. Similarly, the gastrointestinal toxicity is formidable and dose-limiting. Severe, and sometimes irreversible, cerebellar/cerebral toxicity in 5 to 15% of courses of treatment limits the peak dose of cytarabine. The pathogenesis, prophylactic and therapeutic measures are unknown. These major toxicities are age-related and prohibitive to the use of high-dose cytarabine therapy in patients older than 55 to 60 years. Subacute noncardiogenic pulmonary edema occurs in some patients, with an incidence of about 20%, and seems to have an intriguing coincidence with precedent streptococcal septicaemia; high-dose systemic steroids may be beneficial. Corneal toxicity is very frequent in high-dose cytarabine therapy but is always reversible. It is largely preventable with prophylactic steroid or 2-deoxycytidine eyedrops. Fever, exanthema and hepatic toxicity have an incidence similar to that in standard dosage. The maximum tolerable cumulated dose of cytarabine is significantly lower when the agent is administered as a continuous infusion, due to myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity. Conversely, continuous infusion may be less neurotoxic. The antileukemic effect of continuous infusion high-dose cytarabine is less well established. The only significant toxicity of low-dose cytarabine is myelosuppression. Given the generally poor condition of leukemia patients, low-dose cytarabine therapy is well tolerated, although occasional cases of diarrhoea, reversible cerebellar symptoms, peritoneal and pericardial reactions, and ocular toxicity have been reported. Continuous infusion may be more toxic than the usual intermittent dosage. It is concluded that the toxicity of the standard induction regimen for ANLL is acceptable in patients younger than 60 to 65 years with no concurrent disease. Low dose cytarabine is tolerable for virtually all ANLL patients, but the overall therapeutic efficacy still needs to be defined and compared to standard therapy in the relevant age groups.",

Cytarabine is cytotoxic to a wide variety of proliferating mammalian cells in culture. It exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S-phase) and under certain conditions blocking the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S-phase. Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, it appears that cytarabine acts through the inhibition of DNA polymerase. A limited, but significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also been reported.",

Cases of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to cytarabine have been reported but are uncommon. The time to onset was usually within the first few cycles of therapy, and the pattern of serum enzyme elevations ranged from cholestatic to hepatocellular. Immunoallergic and autoimmune features were generally not present. Antineoplastic regimens, including cytarabine, have been implicated in cases of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and peliosis, but the role of cytarabine in these reactions was unclear. Many examples of liver injury attributed to cytarabine in the literature were typical of jaundice of sepsis rather than acute hepatocellular or cholestatic injury, although high doses of cytarabine may cause hyperbilirubinemia independent of hepatic injury.",

Plasma concentrations of digoxin should be carefully monitored in patients receiving such combination chemotherapy regimens. Use of digoxin oral elixir or liquid-filled capsules may minimize the potential interaction, since the drug is rapidly and extensively absorbed from these dosage forms. Limited data suggest that the extent of GI absorption of digitoxin (no longer commercially available in the US) is not substantially affected by concomitant administration of combination chemotherapy regimens known to decrease absorption of digoxin.",

Some patients with normal corneas treated in this way for seven days developed glittering opacities in the lower layers of the epithelium, usually without stainability by fluorescein. Some had pain and developed signs of iritis. The severity was related to the concentration used and the time of exposure. After the applications were discontinued, all corneas cleared gradually during three weeks.

Ara-C (1.0-1.5 g/sq m/day) was given as a 5 day continuous infusion to all patients. Four patients with persistent leukemia received a second 3- or 5-day course. The POG protocol included the admin of granulocyte colony stimulating factor for the priming of myeloblasts. Diagnostic criteria for pulmonary insufficiency included noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with exclusion of underlying cardiorespiratory, infectious, or metabolic conditions. autopsy material also was reviewed. Of the 22 patients, 5 died (23%), including 2 who received a second course of Ara-C as a results of pulmonary insufficiency that developed at a median of 8 days (range, 3-38 days) after the first course. Three patients died despite intubation and pressor support. Two patients were managed successfully with colloids, diuresis, and oxygen by face mask; remission was achieved in both. The postmortem exam of one patient disclosed airless lungs, profound pulmonary edema, and subpleural nodules, but no evidence of leukemia. Pulmonary insufficiency from high dose Ara-C varies in severity and may be fatal. It may occur during or after treatment. Awareness of this potential complication, careful attention to fluid status, and aggressive supportive care may optimize outcome.",

The drug exerted its deleterious effect on limb morphogenesis by causing abnormal cell death within the undifferentiated limb bud mesoderm.

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

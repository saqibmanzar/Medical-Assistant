Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Samples were collected at the end of the work shift. Workers were divided into the following exposure groups according to work tasks: (I) primarily skin exposure (n= 112), (II) primarily respiratory tract exposure (n= 34), and (III) equal exposure by both routes (n= 84). Air concentrations at the workplace and amount of time spent with skin contact were not studied. There was no control group; values were compared to the nonexposed Finnish population level of <0.1 umol/L. Skin absorption was the most effective route of exposure as reflected by urinary chlorophenol concentrations. The median concentration in workers with skin absorption was 7.8 umol/L (range 0.1 to 210.9 umol/L) and was significantly different from that in workers with the respiratory tract as the main route of exposure (median concentration 0.9 umol/L; range 0.1 to 13.3 umol/L; p< 0.001) and from those with both routes of equal importance (1.4 umol/L; range 0.1 to 47.8 umol/L; p< 0.001).",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Cells were plated in 9 mL of medium and cultured for 24 hours. The test chemical was added to the dishes in 1 mL of medium to give the desired concentration. The following dose ranges were tested: 2,4-dichlorophenol, 12.5 to 50 ug/mL; 2,6-dichlorophenol, 125 to 500 ug/mL; 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, 6.25 to 50 ug/mL; 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, 12.5 to 100 ug/mL; 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, 12.5 to 100 ug/mL; pentachlorophenol, 6.25 to 50 ug/mL. Each of the chlorophenols tested reduced the plating efficiency in a dose dependent manner. This cytotoxic effect can be attributed to the ability of pentachlorophenol and other chlorophenols to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. None of the chlorophenols produced significant increases in the frequency of 6-thioguanine resistant mutants. However, the apparent lack of induction of gene mutation by chorophenols does not necessarily mean the lack of genotoxicity of these chemicals.",

This germicidal agent was used as a fungicide, bactericide, wood preservative, biocide, and intermediate in production of higher chlorinated phenols. It is not registered for current use in the U.S., but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Trichlorophenols produce redness and edema on skin contact and on prolonged exposure mild to moderate chemical burns of skin of man. In eye they induce conjunctival irritation and sometimes corneal injury and iritis. Dusts are irritating to nose and pharynx and systemic effects presumably resemble phenol. Trichlorophenols can have an irritating effect on the lung, and it cannot be excluded that long-term exposure may produce pulmonary fibrosis. Children with low levels (<3.58 ug/g) and high levels (=3.58 ug/g) of urinary 2,4,6-TCP had a higher risk of parent-reported ADHD compared to children with levels below the limit of detection after adjusting for covariates.  It was concluded that exposure to TCP may increase the risk of behavioral impairment in children. The potential neurotoxicity of these chemicals should be considered in public health efforts to reduce environmental exposures/contamination, especially in countries where organochlorine pesticides are still commonly used.  2,4,6-Trichlorophenol is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen according to NTP. ANIMAL STUDIES: In rats lethal doses of chlorophenols produce restlessness, increased rate of respiration, rapidly developing motor weakness, tremors, clonic convulsions, dyspnea, and coma. 2,4,6-TCP produces these signs but decreased activity and motor weakness do not appear quite so promptly.  2,4,6-TCP was not hepatotoxic in rats as assessed by measurement of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase and serum sorbitol dehydrogenase.  Carcinogenesis bioassays were conducted by giving 2,4,6-TCP in feed to groups of male and female rats and male mice for two years.  Adverse effects at two years were leukocytosis and monocytosis of peripheral blood and hyperplasia of bone marrow in both sexes of rats. In mice, liver toxicity, including individual liver cell abnormalities, focal areas of cellular alteration, and focal and nodular areas of hyperplasia were commonly present. TCP caused leukemias/lymphomas in male rats, and possibly in female rats and female mice as well, and induced liver tumors in male and female mice. 2,4,6-TCP, a non-mutagen to Salmonella, was negative in tests for chromosome breakage in vitro, but did produce numerical chromosome changes and micronuclei in V79 cells. 2,4,6-TCP induces structural chromosome aberrations in CHO cells and in V79 cells using a 3-hr treatment and 20-hr sampling time (17-hr recovery). Positive results were obtained when a recovery time of 4-12 hr was allowed after the 24-hr treatment with 2,4,6-TCP, and when 2,4,6-TCP was tested with S9. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: 2,4,6-TCP was applied at single doses of into compartments of a natural experimental pond to study the effect on biota. Changes seen included a rapid decline of daphnia concentration to zero after phytoplankton, a continuous increase of contamination indicators like flagellates and microorganisms, and a significant decrease in O2 concentration as a secondary effect of the changed balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic populations.",

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

Incr elastic recoil pressure of the lung and x-ray signs of lung tissue involvement were noticed in 2 subjects. The findings suggest an irritating effect on the lung of trichlorophenol, and it cannot be excluded that long-term exposure may produce pulmonary fibrosis. /Trichlorophenol/",

However, little is known about their neurotoxicity in humans.  OBJECTIVES:  /The/ goal was to examine the association between body burden of TCPs (ie, 2,4,5-TCP and 2,4,6-TCP) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  METHODS:  /This study/ calculated ORs and 95% /confidence intervals/ (CIs) from logistic regression analyses using data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to evaluate the association between urinary TCPs and parent-reported ADHD among 2546 children aged 6-15 years.  RESULTS:  Children with low levels (<3.58 ug/g) and high levels (=3.58 ug/g) of urinary 2,4,6-TCP had a higher risk of parent-reported ADHD compared to children with levels below the limit of detection (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.43 and OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.66, respectively; p for trend=0.006) after adjusting for covariates. No association was found between urinary 2,4,5-TCP and parent-reported ADHD.  CONCLUSION:  Exposure to TCP may increase the risk of behavioral impairment in children. The potential neurotoxicity of these chemicals should be considered in public health efforts to reduce environmental exposures/contamination, especially in countries where organochlorine pesticides are still commonly used.",

Dietary concentrations were 0 [20/group], 5000 [0.5%], or 10,000 [1%] ppm. Female mice began with 10,000 and 20,000 ppm but after 38 weeks were lowered due to reduced body weights to 2500 and 5000 ppm for 67 weeks; exposures averaged 5200 and 10,400 ppm. Adverse effects at two years were leukocytosis and monocytosis of peripheral blood and hyperplasia of bone marrow in both sexes of rats. In mice, liver toxicity, including individual liver cell abnormalities, focal areas of cellular alteration, and focal and nodular areas of hyperplasia were commonly present. Regarding carcinogenic activity, TCP caused leukemias/lymphomas in male rats, and possibly in female rats and female mice as well, and induced liver tumors in male and female mice. Using NTP categories of evidence indicates 'clear evidence of carcinogenicity' for male rats [hematopoietic system tumors]; 'equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity' for female rats [hematopoietic system tumors]; 'clear evidence of carcinogenicity' for male and female mice [liver tumors] .",

Groups of 50 rats of each sex were admin 2,4,6-trichlorophenol at one of two doses, either 5,000 or 10,000 ppm, for 106 or 107 wk. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated rats of each sex. All surviving rats were killed at the end of admin of the test chemical. Groups of 50 male mice were admin 2,4,6-trichlorophenol at one of two doses, either 5,000 or 10,000 for 105 wk. Groups of 50 female mice were admin the test chemical at one of two doses, initially either 10,000 or 20,000 ppm, for 38 wk. Because of excessively lowered body weights in the dosed groups of the females, the doses for the females were then reduced to 2,500 and 5,000 ppm, respectively, and administration at the lower doses was continued for 67 wk. The time-weighted average doses for the female mice were either 5,214 or 10,428 ppm. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving mice were killed at the end of admin of the test chemical.  Mean body weights of dosed rats and mice of each sex were lower than those of corresponding controls and were dose related throughout the bioassay. Survivals to the end of the experiment were 68% or greater in all groups of rats and 80% or greater in all groups of mice. In the male rats, lymphomas or leukemias occurred at incidences that were dose related (P = 0.006) and in direct comparisons were significantly higher in the low-dose (P = 0.019) and high-dose (P = 0.004) groups than in the corresponding control group (controls 4/20, low-dose 25/50, high-dose 29/50). Leukocytosis and monocytosis of the peripheral blood and hyperplasia of the bone marrow also occurred in some dosed male rats not having lymphoma or leukemia. In the female rats, monocytic leukemia did not occur at incidences that were significant. However, as in the male rats, leukocytosis and monocytosis of the peripheral blood and hyperplasia of the bone marrow occurred in the dosed female rats but not in the controls (blood leukocytosis and monocytosis: controls 0/20, low-dose 6/50, high-dose 3/50; bone marrow hyperplasia: controls 0/20, low-dose 16/50, high-dose 2/50). In both the male and female mice, hepatocellular carcinomas or adenomas occurred at incidences that were dose related (P < 0.001), and in direct comparisons were significantly higher in the low- and high-dose male groups and the high-dose female group (P < or = 0.001) than in the corresponding control groups (males: controls 4/20, low-dose 32/49, high-dose 39/47; females: controls 1/20, low-dose 12/50, high-dose 24/48). It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, 2,4,6trichlorophenol was carcinogenic in male F344 rats, inducing lymphomas or leukemias. The test chemical was also carcinogenic in both sexes of B6C3F1 mice, inducing hepatocellular carcinomas or adenomas.",

Its former use as a defoliant, herbicide, and fungicide may have resulted in its direct release to the environment. 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol may also be released to the environment as a result of the chlorination of phenol-containing wastewater or drinking water and from the bleaching process in pulp and paper mills. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.008 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4,6-trichlorophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4,6-trichlorophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 24 days. 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol is expected to have moderate to slight mobility based upon Koc values of 150-2200. The pKa of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol is 6.23, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces of the neutral form is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from moist soil of the anion form is not expected because anions do not volatilize. 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 82.5-89.3% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol will biodegrade in water based on results of 100% degradation in 8-14 days. Volatilization from water surfaces of the anion form is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's pKa. However, the neutral form of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol is expected to volatilize based on the Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 20 and 150 days, respectively. BCF values of 87-676 in fish suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol is expected to undergo photolysis in surface waters based on an aqueous photodegradation half-life of 2.1 hours. 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2,4,6-trichlorophenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4,6-trichlorophenol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,4,6-trichlorophenol via ingestion of contaminated fish or drinking water. (SRC)",

Volatilization of the anion form of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol from moist soil surfaces is not expected because anions do not volatilize(SRC). Volatilization of neutral 2,4,6-trichlorophenol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure, 0.008 mm Hg(7), and water solubility, 500 mg/L(8). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(7).

A pKa of 6.23(5) indicates 2,4,6-trichlorophenol will exist partially in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization of the anion form from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). Volatilization of the neutral form from water surfaces is expected(6) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.008 mm Hg(7), and water solubility, 500 mg/L(8). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(6), volatilization half-lives for the neutral form from a model river and model lake are 20 and 150 days, respectively(SRC). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol is expected to undergo photolysis in surface waters based on an aqueous photodegradation half-life of 2.1 hours when irradiated with light at environmentally relevant wavelengths(9). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(6). According to a classification scheme(10), BCFs of 87-676(11-13) in fish, suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high(SRC). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol biodegraded 100% in 8-14 days in filtered and unfiltered water(14).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Total degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in Dunkirk silt loam took 5 days and in Mardin silt loam took 13 days(3). In Labisch soil, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol biodegraded 67% in 60 days(4). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol was aerobically degraded 95% in 3 days and 27% in 80 days in non-sterile and sterile clay loam, respectively(5). Microbial degradation, volatilization, and photodecomposition were ruled out in the sterile soil indicating that other mechanisms contribute to degradation(5). Activated sludge made from soil resulted in 100% removal of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in 3 days(6); sewage seed resulted in complete removal in 7 days(7); 39% removal by activated sludge in 14 days was reported(8). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol was readily degraded in an aerobic microcosm using soils from the saturated zone(9). A 2,4-dichlorophenol-acclimated soil inoculum completely degraded an unspecified initial concentration of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in 28 days(10). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol, present at 1.5 mg/L, was completely degraded in 8 days using an inoculum derived from river sediment obtained near a petrochemical plant(11). The compound was 92% degraded in 30 days using an activated sludge inoculum(12). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol, present at 100 mg/L, reached 82.5-89.3% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(13).",

A pentachlorophenol acclimated anaerobic digester degraded 2,4,6-trichlorophenol to 2,4-dichlorophenol in 36 hours(2). An anaerobic sludge digester completely converted 2,4,6-trichlorophenol to 4-chlorophenol in 13 days(3). Anaerobic degradation of 28% and 25% in 80 days was reported in non-sterile and sterile clay loam(4). Microbial degradation, volatilization, and photodecomposition were ruled out in both sterile and non-sterile soils under anaerobic conditions indicating that other mechanisms contribute to degradation(4). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol was degraded 82% in 12 hrs using an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor(5). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol was readily degraded in an anaerobic microcosm using subsurface soils from both unsaturated and saturated zones(6).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 24 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(2) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Coated on silica gels and irradiated with light wavelengths >290 nm for 17 hours, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol was degraded 65.8%(3). The rate constant for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solutions is 1.7X10+7 L/mol-sec(4); this corresponds to an aquatic half-life of 130 years at an aquatic concentration of 1X10-17 hydroxyl radicals per liter(5). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(6). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol is expected to photodegrade in surface waters based on an aqueous photodegradation half-life of 2.1 hours when irradiated with light at environmentally relevant wavelengths(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The Henry's Law constant for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol is estimated as 4.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 0.008 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 500 mg/L(3). This Henry's Law constant indicates that neutral 2,4,6-trichlorophenol is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(4). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life of the neutral form from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 20 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life of the neutral form from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 150 days(SRC). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces of the neutral form may occur(SRC). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(2).",

It is based on: (1) the TF-IDF, adapted to chemical structures, (2) location information in the text (e.g. title, abstract, keywords), and (3) the document size.  Springer Nature aims to provide only highly qualitative and relevant content but references of lower relevance aren't withheld as they might contain also very useful information.",

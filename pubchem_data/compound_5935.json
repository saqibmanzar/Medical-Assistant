When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

Exposure can lead to depression of the formed elements in the blood, weakness, diarrhea, and rarely, jaundice, alopecia, vertigo, tinnitus, diminished hearing, hemolytic anemia, various chromosomal abnormalities, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia (which may lead to bleeding from the gums and gastrointestinal tract, petechiae and small subcutaneous hemorrhages), immunosuppression, erythema multiforme, delayed catamenia, severe and even uncontrollable depression of the hematopoietic system, persistent pancytopenia, oligomenorrhea, temporary or permanent amenorrhea, and in males, impaired spermatogenesis, azoospermia and total germinal aplasia. Other symptoms may include leukopenia, granulocytopenia, hypoplasia of all elements of bone marrow, lymphopenia and precipitation of uric acid in kidney tubules. It can cause myelosuppression and gastrointestinal symptoms. It can also cause hemorrhagic complications, maculopapular skin eruptions, herpes zoster, and on injection, thrombophlebitis. It can also cause thrombosis on injection. Exposure can also lead to latent viral infection and menstrual irregularities in women. Necrosis has occurred following extravascular injections.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

The ipsilateral response was characterized by intense miosis, ischemia of iris (due to increased intraocular pressure) and leakage of fluorescein into posterior chamber. The iris ischemia was at least partly secondary to the pronounced elevation of intraocular pressure that occurred following nitrogen mustard. A contralateral rise in protein levels in the aqueous humor occurred in 5 of 22 rabbits. No contralateral iris ischemia or miosis was observed. Neither the ipsilateral nor the contralateral response was inhibited by pretreatment with aspirin. Aqueous fluorophotometry was only slightly more sensitive in detecting a contralateral response than simple measurement of protein levels in the aqueous.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Epidermal membranes displaying permeability constants greater than 1.5 x 10E-3 cm/hr were deemed to have been damaged during preparation and were rejected. The mean steady state of absorption for triethylene glycol monobutyl ether was 22.2 ug/cm sq/hr (SD +/- 8.59), which was 100-fold less than that of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether. Test material did not increase permeability of the membrane (damage ratio of 1.26).",

Test material was applied to shaved areas of skin on the back and sides of each rat (12 cm sq in area), uniformly spread, and covered with a semiocclusive dressing for 6 hours. After removal of the dressing, the application site was wiped with a dampened towel. Material was applied in this manner daily, 5 days/week for 13 weeks. Additional satellite groups of 5 rats/sex/dose level were administered TGME for 30 days for interim hematological (48 hr and 30 days), clinical chemistry (48 hr and 30 days), body weight determinations, clinical observations, and dermal irritation. ... There were no indications of systemic toxicity at any dose. Mean body weight and food consumption were comparable to controls throughout the study. There were no treatment-related hematological changes in the interim groups or in males administered test material for 13 weeks.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.5X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates triethylene glycol monobutyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase triethylene glycol monobutyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.5 hours. Alcohols and ethers do not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore triethylene glycol monobutyl ether is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, triethylene glycol monobutyl ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-14 atm-cu m/mole. Based on %theoretical BODS of 0-24 in 5-20 days, triethylene glycol monobutyl ether is expected to biodegrade slowly in soil and water. If released into water, triethylene glycol monobutyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to triethylene glycol monobutyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where triethylene glycol monobutyl ether is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to triethylene glycol monobutyl ether via ingestion of contaminated drinking water and dermal contact with products containing triethylene glycol monobutyl ether.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

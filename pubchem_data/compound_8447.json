For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Topical doses were 36.1 ug/animal for (14)C-MBT and 33.6 ug/animal for (14)C-MBTS. Although more MBT passed through the skin than MBTS and although relative to rats, guinea pigs absorbed a greater percentage of the dose (33.4% compared to 16.1-17.5% of the MBT and 12.2% compared to 5.94-7.87% for MBTS) the disposition of radioactivity derived from the two compounds was similar. Washing of the skin removed more of the radioactivity from guinea pigs than from rats. For both sexes of rats dosed iv with (14)C-MBT 0.602 mg/kg) or (14)C-MBTS 0.571 mg/kg) disposition of the compounds was similar. In 72 hr, 90.9-101% of the dose appeared in the urine and 3.79-15.1% in the feces. At this time a small portion of the administered radioactivity (1.52-1.96% of the dose) remained associated with erythrocytes. Oral dosing of rats for 14 days with unlabeled MBT (0.510 mg/kg/day) prior to a single dose of (14)C-MBT (0.503 mg/kg) or with unlabeled MBTS (0.521 mg/kg/day) prior to a single dose of (14)C-MBTS (0.730 mg/kg). For both sexes disposition of the compounds was similar. At 96 hr after dosing a small portion of the administered radioactivity (1.20-1.69% of the dose) remained associated with erythrocytes most of which was bound to the membranes. For both compounds and sexes 60.8-101% of the radioactivity administered appeared in the urine and 3.46-9.99% in the feces in 96 hr. At the time only trace amounts of radioactivity remained in tissues other than blood. Of these tissues thyroid contained the highest concentration. In the urine there was a detectable MBT or MBTS but there were two metabolites one of which was identified as a thioglucuronide derivative of MBT. The other was possibly a sulfonic acid derivative of MBT. In conclusion there were similarities in absorption, distribution, and metabolism of (14)C-MBT and (14)C-MBTS in rats and in guinea pigs, indicating that (14)C-MBTS was readily converted to (14)C-MBT.",

Male Wistar rats were orally administered (14)C labeled N-oxydiethylene-2-benzothiazole ODEBT, (35)S labeled ODEBT, (35)S labeled 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) and (35)S labeled 2,2'-dibenzothiazyl-disulfide (BTDS). Urine and feces were collected periodically for 72 hours and the urinary and fecal metabolites were determined. The urinary level of 2-benzothiazyl-mercapturic acid (BTMA) was determined in rats administered OCEBT orally. The incorporation of (14)C or (35)S labeled L-cysteine was determined in rats administered ODEBT orally. Glutathione conjugates of MBT from biliary metabolites were determined in rat liver in vitro. The (35)S retention ratios in BTDS and MBT was over 90%. In BTMA only 0.5% of the (35)S was retained. The ratios of conjugated to nonconjugated radioactivity obtained using (35)S labeled compounds were reduced when compared to those found for (14)C labeled compounds. Coadministration of cysteine increased the hepatic glutathione level and mercapturate excretion while inclusion of the glutathione synthetase inhibitor L-methionine-SR-sulfoximine decreased levels. The /data indicate/ that the sulfur atom in BTMA is mostly replaced by the endogenous sulfur from the cysteine pool.",

The stability of the mercaptobenzothiazoles constituting the mercapto mix was studied both in petrolatum and in buffer solution at pH 6.5 with and without glutathione. In petrolatum vehicle, dibenzothiazyl disulfide was the dominant compound found in stored mercapto mix. In buffer solution at pH 6.5, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole and the sulfenamide derivatives morpholinyl mercaptobenzothiazole and N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazyl sulfenamide were converted into dibenzothiazyl disulfide. In the presence of glutathione, both the sulfenamide derivatives and the dibenzothiazyl disulfide were rapidly converted into 2- mercaptobenzothiazole. The findings explain the cross-sensitivities reported for the mercaptobenzothiazole group as a result of chemical reactions resulting in one main hapten. The use of a single substance for patch testing for mercaptobenzothiazole hypersensitivity is reported.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

To determine the amount of sensitizer remaining after leaching, Soxhlet extraction with acetonitrile was subsequently performed. High-performance liquid chromatography was used for chemical analysis. 12 MBT-sensitive patients were patch tested with serial dilutions of MBT and MBTS ln petrolatum. A Latin Square design was used in statistical analysis of variance of the patch test results. Large amounts of thioureas leached from 2 rubber articles eliciting thiourea dermatitis, the literature suggesting that these would have been well above the elicitation threshold. Leaching of MBTS was relatively greater than MBT into most media, whereas MBT was a more potent elicitor than MBTS at equivalent concentrations. The lowest eliciting concentration of MBT in 1 subject was 0.01%. Such information should prove helpful to manufacturers in designed products that do not release allergens sufficiently to cause reactions in consumers.",

These 3 patients reacted to mercaptobenzothiazole type accelerators including MBT and MBTS. MBT and MBTS were determined in each item of causative footwear by chemical analysis including extraction by shaking with acetone-chloroform (1:1) mixture at room temperature and determination using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (R-HPLC). Subsequently, /an identification of/ styrenated phenol (SP) a newly found allergenic antioxidant as a causative chemical in a case from ladies canvas shoes. The patient reacted to SP but not to MBT and MBTS though SP, MBT and MBTS were determined in the causative shoes by gas chromatography (GC) GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and HPLC. p-tert-butylphenol-formaldehyde resin (PTBP-F-R) (a known allergenic adhesive ingredient) as a causative chemical in a case from ladies sneakers /was also identified/. The patient reacted to PTBP-F-R but not to p-tert-butylphenol (PTBP), MBT and MBTS. These 4 compounds were determined in the causative sneakers by GC-MS and HPLC. /These/ studies revealed that not only known allergens such as MBT, MBTS and PTBP-F-R but also a newly found one such as SP were important causes of allergic contact dermatitis from rubber footwear.",

The examination first indicated only a positive reaction to 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, patch to the miner's suit, rubber gloves, rubber boots and the cable being negative, which followed to a decision that the illness was not occupation-related. The skin occupational disease was then confirmed by analysis of personal history and catamnesis data, clinical course, and patch of the actual allergen 2,2'-dibenzothiazyl disulfide, which induced a positive erythema infiltration vesiculous reaction. The chemical is cleaved by hydrolysis giving two molecules of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, which also provoked a positive reaction in the patient, thus exhibiting a group cross sensitivity. ...",

Pregnant rats were given MBTS at a dosage of 0, 0.04, 0.2 or 1% in the diet from day 0 to day 20 of pregnancy. Daily intakes of MBTS were 26 mg/kg for the 0.04% group 127 mg/kg for the 0.2% group and 596 mg/kg for the 1% group. Maternal body weight gain during day 0 to day 14 of pregnancy in the 1% group was significantly lowered but no significant changes induced by MBTS were observed in any other maternal parameters such as food consumption and clinical sign of toxicity. There were no significant compound related effects on the incidence of pre and post-implantation losses and the number, sex ratio and body weight of live fetuses. Morphological examinations of the fetuses revealed no evidence of teratogenesis. In the postnatal development of the offspring from the dams given MBTS a high survival rate and good growth of the offspring were seen. It could be concluded that MBTS possesses no adverse effects on the pre and postnatal development of offspring in rats at the doses employed in the present study.",

Four animals/sex were sacrificed at 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post treatment, at which time whole blood and plasma were also collected. Urine and feces was collected at 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. The primary route of elimination of the radioactivity during the 96 hour test period was via the urine, accounting for 72.1% to 106% of the administered radioactivity. Only 4.03% to 10.3% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the feces over the 96 hour period. A small portion of the administered radioactivity (0.432 to 2.04% of dose) remained associated with the erythrocytes. Low dose animals had a greater percentage of the dose retained in whole blood and plasma relative to the high dose animals, indicating a saturation process at the high dose level.

For rats sacrificed at 72 hours, urine and feces were collected at 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours. The primary route of elimination of radioactivity during the 72 hour test period was via the urine, accounting for 90.9 to 101% of the administered radioactivity. Only 3.79 to 15.1% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the feces. A small portion of the administered radioactivity (1.52 to 1.96% of the dose) remained associated with the erythrocytes. Although tissue was not examined, it was concluded that the data did not indicate that any appreciable amounts of radioactivity is retained in the tissue.",

If released to soil, 2,2'-dibenzothiazyl disulfide will be immobile and biodegrade slowly (0.8% theoretical BOD in 2 weeks in an aqueous screening test using soil inoculum). If released to water, volatilization is not expected to be an important removal process. However, adsorption to sediment or particulate material in an aquatic system is possible. Insufficient data are available to predict the relative importance or rate of biodegradation in water although one aqueous screening biodegradaton test would suggest slow biodegradation. 2,2'-Dibenzothiazyl disulfide has the potential to photolyze directly since it absorbs UV light >290 nm, but the kinetics of the potential photolysis are not known. If released to the atmosphere, 2,2'-dibenzothiazyl disulfide will degrade in the ambient atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of approximately 1.3 hrs. Occupational exposure to rubber processing chemicals, such as 2,2'-dibenzothiazyl disulfide, occurs through dermal contact and inhalation of dust. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

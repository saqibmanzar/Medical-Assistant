For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

The antihypertensive effects of these 4,5-dehydromoxonidine and guanidine metabolites are only 1/10 and 1/100 the effect of moxonidine.  Oxidation on either the methyl group (pyrimidine ring) or on the imidazole ring of moxonidine results in the formation of the hydroxylmethyl moxonidine metabolite or the hydroxy moxonidine metabolite. The hydroxy moxonidine metabolite can be further oxidized to the dihydroxy metabolite or it can lose water to form the dehydrogenated moxonidine metabolite, which itself can be further oxidized to form an N-oxide. Aside from these Phase I metabolites, Phase II metabolism of moxonidine is also evident with the presence of a cysteine conjugate metabolite minus chlorine. Nevertheless, the identification of the hydroxy moxonidine metabolite with a high level of dehydrogenated moxonidine metabolite in human urine samples suggests that dehydrogenation from the hydroxy metabolite to the dehydrogenated moxonidine metabolite represents the primary metabolic pathway in humans.  The cytochromes P450 responsible for the metabolism of moxonidine in humans have not yet been determined.  Ultimately, the parent moxonidine compound was observed to be the most abundant component in different biological matrices of urinary excretion samples, verifying that metabolism only plays a modest role in the clearance of moxonidine in humans.",

As this class was further explored it was discovered that sympathoadrenal activity can also be suppressed by a second pathway with a newly discovered drug target specific to imidazolines. Specifically, moxonidine binds the imidazoline receptor subtype 1 (I1) and to a lesser extent \u03b1lpha-2-adrenoreceptors in the RSV causing a reduction of sympathetic activity, reducing systemic vascular resistance and thus arterial blood pressure.  Moreover, since alpha-2-adrenergic receptors are considered the primary molecular target that facilitates the most common side effects of sedation and dry mouth that are elicited by most centrally acting antihypertensives, moxonidine differs from these other centrally acting antihypertensives by demonstrating only low affinity for central alpha-2-adrenoceptors compared to the aforementioned I1-imidazoline receptors.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, ingestion, inhalation, dermal absorption), exposure to this white crystalline substance may occur from its use as a chemical intermediate. Effects from exposure can include burns to the skin and eyes, weakness, headache, dizziness, shock, and death from cardiac or pulmonary failure. Contact with 3-chlorophenol should be protected against by wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus, and chemical protective clothing specifically recommended by the shipper or producer. However, if contact does occur, immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, and remove and isolate contaminated clothing. While 3-chlorophenol does not ignite easily, it can burn, producing irritating and poisonous gases. For small fires involving 3-chlorophenol, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, or standard foam. Runoff from fire control water may give off poisonous gases, and should be controlled by diking, as necessary. 3-Chlorophenol may be shipped via air, rail, road, or water in containers bearing the label, \"Keep away from food.\" Small spills of 3-chlorophenol may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. Prior to implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.125 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-chlorophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-chlorophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.4 days. 3-Chlorophenol absorbs light in the deep UV, but since there is some overlap between its absorption spectrum and the tropospheric solar spectrum, degradation by natural sunlight may occurr. If released to soil, 3-chlorophenol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon a Koc of 350. The pKa of 3-chlorophenol is 9.12, indicating that this compound will partially exist in an anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.45X10-7 atm-cu m/mole for the neutral species. 3-Chlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 3-Chlorophenol is expected to biodegrade in both aerobic and anaerobic soils with biodegradation half-lives ranging from 15 to 160 days. If released into water, 3-chlorophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. 3-Chlorophenol biodegraded 6% after 40 days in farm stream water, 56% after 30 days in farm stream sediments, and 31.7% after 5 days in river water, suggesting that biodegradation of 3-chlorophenol in aquatic environments is variable. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant for the neutral species. A BCF range of 5.1-16 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 3-chlorophenol may be through inhalation of vapors and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-chlorophenol is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 3-chlorophenol through dermal contact with and the ingestion of contaminated water sources. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 3-chlorophenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.4 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.4X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 3-Chlorophenol absorbs light in the deep UV, but since there is some overlap between its absorption spectrum and the tropospheric solar spectrum, degradation by natural sunlight is possible(4).",

The anaerobic biodegradation rate constant of 3-chlorophenol in marine sediment was measured as 0.02 days-1, corresponding to a half-life of about 36 days(2). Degradation of 3-chlorophenol in clay loam soil under anaerobic conditions was 37% in 160 days vs 15% in sterile control(3). 3-Chlorophenol was degraded by anaerobic columns of actively methanogenic aquifer material contaminated by landfill leachate but not by nonmethanogenic aquifer material(4). Complete degradation was reported in 7 weeks with incubation using municipal sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions(5). Incubation of 3-chlorophenol with sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions gave the following results: complete disappearance of 3-chlorophenol in 6 weeks with an approximately 3 week lag period using unacclimated sludge; approximately 100% loss of 3-chlorophenol in 7 or 12 days using sludge acclimated to 3- or 4-chlorophenol, respectively; no degradation in 32 days using sludge acclimated to 2-chlorophenol(6). 3-Chlorophenol biodegrades in the absence of oxygen under methanogenic, sulfidogenic, and iron-reducing conditions(7). 3-Chlorophenol degraded completely in <15 hours (no lag phase) in an anaerobic propionate enrichment culture at 35 \u00b0C(8). 3-Chlorophenol (100 ug/L) was persistent (lag phase >30 days) in adapted anaerobic, non-adapted anaerobic, and aerobic sand and gravel after 4 weeks in a model ecosystem consisting of a laboratory filter operating with groundwater. Complete metabolism after 7 days was observed only when 3-chlorophenol (100 ug/L) was applied to a gravel filter that favored microbial degradation and adapted to phenol degradation(9). The half-life of 3-chlorophenol in anaerobic lake sediment (<1% organic matter) was reported as 173 days with a 2 day lag period(10). 3-Chlorophenol degraded in phenol-enriched, acclimated methanogenic culture at a much higher rate than in unacclimated digester sludge culture and dechlorinated 2-chlorophenol faster(11).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.4 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 3-Chlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Aquatic photolysis of 3-chlorophenol at 296 nm results in the detachment of chloride ions with equal formation of H+. The presence of dissolved oxygen or the ionization of 3-chlorophenol due to its pKa does not affect the outcome of the reaction. The quantum yield of the photoconversion was slightly higher with the anionic form(3). 3-Chlorophenol absorbs light in the deep UV, but since there is some overlap between its absorption spectrum and the tropospheric solar spectrum, degradation by natural sunlight is possible(4). The rate constant for aqueous reaction of 3-chlorophenol with singlet oxygen (O2) in phosphate buffer at 27 \u00b0C was determined to be 1.60X10+8 mole/L-sec, which corresponds to a half-life of 6.0 hours, assuming an O2 freshwater surface concentration under noontime, midsummer sun conditions of ca. 2X10-13 mole/L(5). 3-Chlorophenol (4.46X10-5 mol) reacted with 1 ml NOx in air for 5 hr to give the 2-, 4-, and 6-nitro-3-chlorophenol adducts in 6.3%, 17%, and 11% yields, respectively(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

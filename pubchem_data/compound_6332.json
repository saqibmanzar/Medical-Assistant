When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Ethyl-bromide was formerly used as a narcotic agent for dental and medical surgery, and was considered to be a relatively safe agent. It is not a cardiotoxin, and only one death resulting from ethyl-bromide anesthesia had previously been reported.

Ethyl bromide is used as an ethylating agent in chemical synthesis. Ethyl bromide was formerly used as a narcotic agent for dental and medical surgery. HUMAN STUDIES: The main health concerns relating to the exposure of ethyl bromide are the potential for neurotoxicity, irritation of the respiratory tract, damage to genetic material, carcinogenicity, hematotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Limited human experience during surgical anesthesia has indicated that, in addition to CNS depression, there is a possibility of lung congestion and degeneration of the liver and kidney tissues. Symptoms of exposure to ethyl bromide include irritation of the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, and upper respiratory tract. Other symptoms include CNS depression, lung irritation, acute congestion and edema, liver damage, and kidney damage. It can cause nausea, dizziness, headache, and nervous system disturbances. Central nervous system depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest may occur. Loss of balance, slurred speech, unconsciousness, and death can occur. Ingestion can cause burning of the digestive tract, vomiting, and moderate gastrointestinal upset. Skin rash may occur. It can affect motor control after repeated exposures. Heart damage has been reported. The course of ethyl bromide poisoning was described in three stages. The first stage lasted 2-4 days and involved a garlicky odor on the breath, sleepiness, fatigue, sharp pain and paresthesia of the lower legs, and staggering gate. During the second phase that lasted 2-5 days, the symptoms of the first phase grew more severe. The third phase was characterized by spastic paresthesia of the legs, disturbance of the peripheral nervous system, and atrophy of the lower leg. CNS disturbances can also occur at high ethyl bromide exposures. Prognosis for recovery is good for most patients. ANIMAL STUDIES: Immediate effects of ethyl bromide exposure in mice and rats included increased respiration, hyperactivity, incoordination, dyspnea, and coma. The liquid is apparently irritating to skin and eyes of rabbits and is reported to be absorbed through the skin. Exposure of rats and rabbits by inhalation at 538 ppm ethyl bromide for 4 hr/day for 6 months resulted in disruption of hepatic function as shown by a decrease in hepatic glycogen and fat levels as well as prolonged hexobarbital sleep. Hepatic cell granular dystrophy and decreased cytoplasmic RNA levels were also reported. Another study reported that exposure of rats, also at 538 ppm of ethyl bromide by inhalation resulted in hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the pituitary gland, hypertrophy of the cortex, and increased lipid content of the adrenal gland. Severe testicular atrophy was observed in rats, but not in mice, at 1600 ppm (7.14 g/cu m) ethyl bromide but not at lower concentrations. ln female mice, but not in rats, the size and number of corpora lutea in the ovary were decreased at 1600 ppm (7/10 animals) and at 800 ppm (3.57 g/cu m, 3/9 animals). Ethyl bromide was mutagenic to bacteria, but not to Drosophila melanogaster in a single study. In another single study, ethyl bromide increased the incidence of sister chromatid exchanges, but not of chromosomal aberrations in cultured mammalian cells. In a two year carcinogenicity bioassay by inhalation, a dose related increase in uterine tumors was observed in female mice. A small increase in the incidence of gliomas was found in female rats exposed to the highest dose used.",

The course of ethyl bromide poisoning was described in three stages. The first stage lasted 2-4 days and involved a garlicky odor on the breath, sleepiness, fatigue, sharp pain and paresthesia of the lower legs, and staggering gate. During the second phase that lasted 2-5 days, the symptoms of the first phase grew more severe. The third phase was characterized by spastic paresthesia of the legs, disturbance of the peripheral nervous system, and atrophy of the lower leg. CNS disturbances can also occur at high ethyl bromide exposures. Prognosis for recovery is good for most patients. Blood bromine concentration of patients suffering from ethyl bromide poisoning at the time of admission were reported to be 15-53 mg/100 mL. Spinal fluid bromine concentrations were 4-7 mg/100 mL. After 5-10 days without exposure, the patients' blood bromine levels were 5-7 mg/100 mL; however after 2-3 weeks, these returned to background levels of 0.61-1.81 mg/100 mL. No background levels for spinal fluid bromine concentration are reported. Blood bromine levels are suggested as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for ethyl bromide exposure. It was pointed out that the blood bromine levels did vary and all workers supposedly poisoned by ethyl bromine showed greatly elevated levels.",

Two of the cases involved the use of ethyl-bromide as an anesthetic, and one case resulted from the erroneous substitution of ethylene-bromide for ethyl-bromide. Ethyl-bromide was formerly used as a narcotic agent for dental and medical surgery, and was considered to be a relatively safe agent. It is not a cardiotoxin, and only one death resulting from ethyl-bromide anesthesia had previously been reported. Dental technicians and dentists use ethyl-bromide frequently, most often without the assistance of a physician. Legal autopsy results of the three deaths are discussed.",

Ethyl bromide exposure concentrations of 60,000 to 180,000 ppm were used with 5- to 19-minute exposure times, and concentrations of 3200 to 24,000 ppm were used with exposure times of 90 to 810 minutes. The exposed animals that died and those which survived up to 8 days postexposure were autopsied to determine any resulting pathology. The high concentration exposures mainly produced pulmonary damage in the bronchioles and alveoli. Bronchiolar cells showed swelling, distention, and cytoplasmic vacuolation with an exudate containing erythrocytes, epithelial cells, and leukocytes. Swelling of the alveolar walls was noted. Alveolar spaces were found to contain a sero-fibrinous exudate, endothelial leukocytes, and fine granules. At the lower exposure cementations, the pulmonary reactions were similar to those at the higher concentrations, but to a lesser degree. In some cases, congestion of the kidneys and liver caused by large numbers of erythrocytes were also observed. At the lower concentration, kidney effects were the most prominent with apparent compression fo the capillary tufts and tubular damage. There was also central liver lobule necrosis in many cases.",

Four of 10 male and 2/10 female rats exposed to 1,600 ppm died before the end of the 14-week studies. The final mean body weights of rats exposed to 1,600 ppm were lower than the initial mean body weights. Compound-related lesions observed in rats at 1,600 ppm, but not at lower concentrations, included minimal atrophy of the thigh muscle, minimal-to-moderate multifocal mineralization in the cerebellum of the brain, minimal-to-severe hemosiderosis of the spleen, marked atrophy of the testis, and minimal-to-mild atrophy of the uterus. The effects in the testis and uterus are probably due to chemical-related loss in body weight during the studies. In mice, compound-related deaths included 3/10 male and 1/10 female mice exposed to 1,600 ppm, 1/9 males exposed to 800 ppm, and 1/10 males exposed to 400 ppm. The final mean body weights of male and female mice exposed to 1,600 ppm were about 15% lower than those of controls. Compound related effects included atrophy of the uterus and involution of the ovary in females exposed to 1,600 ppm. Atrophy of the skeletal muscle was observed in males and females exposed to 1,600 ppm bromoethane.",

Body Weight and Survival in the Two-year Studies: Mean body weights of exposed and control rats were generally similar throughout the studies. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of male rats (control, 17/49; 100 ppm, 26/50; 200 ppm, 27/50; 400 ppm, 21/50); survival of the 100-ppm group of female rats was greater than that of controls (19/50; 29/50; 24/49; 23/50), and the number of control and 400-ppm male rats and control female rats surviving to the end of the studies was low. Mean body weights of the 400-ppm group of male mice were up to 9% lower than those of controls throughout the study. Mean body weights of the 400-ppm group of female mice were generally 6%-16% lower than those of controls after week 29. No differences in survival were observed between any group of male mice (35/50; 37/50; 30/50; 34/50). The survival of the 400-ppm group of female mice was lower than that of controls at the end of the study (36/50; 37/50; 37/49; 23/49). Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: The incidences of pheochromocytomas or malignant pheochromocytomas (combined) of the adrenal medulla were increased in exposed male rats (control, 8/40; 100 ppm, 23/45; 200 ppm, 18/46; 400 ppm, 21/46). Granular cell neoplasms of the brain were seen in exposed male rats but not in controls (0/49; 3/50; 1/50; 1/50). A glioma, an astrocytoma, or an oligodendroglioma was seen in 3/50 male rats exposed to 100 ppm. Gliomas were not observed in control female rats, but they occurred in exposed female rats with a significant positive trend (0/50; 1/50; 1/48; 3/50). The historical incidence of granular cell tumors in male F344/N rat chamber controls at the study laboratory is 0/297. The incidences of gliomas in the exposed female groups were not significantly greater than that in the controls and were within the historical incidence range for glial cell neoplasms for untreated controls in NTP studies (mean: 23/1,969, 1%; range: 0/50-3/50), but they exceeded the historical incidence range for chamber controls at the study laboratory (mean: 1/297,0.3%; range: 0/50-1/50). Alveolar epithelial hyperplasia was increased in rats exposed to 400 ppm bromoethane (male: 3/48; 7/49; 7/48; 18/48; female: 5/50; 4/48; 5/47; 10149). Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) were seen in four male rats exposed to 200 ppm and in one exposed to 400 ppm. Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas were observed in 3/49 female rats at 400 ppm but not at lower concentrations or in controls. The incidences in exposed male and female rats were not significantly greater than those in controls; however, the historical incidence in rat chamber controls for alveolar/hronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) at the study laboratory is 61299 (2%)for males and 41297 (1.3%) for females. The incidences of epithelial hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of the nasal cavity were increased in rats exposed to 400 ppm. The incidence of suppurative inflammation of the nasal cavity was increased in exposed male rats, and the incidences of suppurative inflammation of the larynx and metaplasia of the olfactory sensory epithelium were increased in exposed male and female rats. An adenoma of the nose was seen in one 400-ppm male rat and in one 400-ppm female mouse. Suppurative inflammation and dilatation of the salivary gland ducts were observed at increased incidences in the 200- and 400-ppm groups of female rats. Animals were found to be positive for rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitisvirus antibodies. The incidence of mammary gland neoplasms was significantly lower in female rats at 400 ppm than in controls (18/50; 15/50; 10148; 7/50). Adenomas (0150; 1/50; 1/47; 6/48), adenocarcinomas (0150; 2/50; 3/47; 19/48), and squamous cell carcinomas (0/50; 1/50; 1/47; 3/48) of the uterus occurred in exposed female mice and not in control mice. The incidence of alveolar/hronchiolar neoplasms was greater in male mice at 400 ppm than in controls (adenomas or carcinomas, combined: 7/50; 6/50; 12/50; 15/50). Acute/chronic inflammation of the lung was observed at increased incidences in female mice at 200 and 400 ppm. ... Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of bromoethane for male F344/N rats, as indicated by increased incidences of pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland; neoplasms of the brain and lung may also have been related to exposure to bromoethane. For female F344/N rats, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity, as indicated by marginally increased incidences of neoplasms of the brain and lung. For male B6C3F1 mice, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity, based on marginally increased incidences of neoplasms of the lung. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for female B6C3F1 mice, as indicated by neoplasms of the uterus.",

Its former use as a refrigerant, grain and fruit fumigant and as a topical and inhalation anesthetic resulted in its direct release to the environment. Ethyl bromide may be released to the environment naturally in volcanic gases and by polar macroalgae. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 467 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl bromide will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl bromide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 45 days. Ethyl bromide does not contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethyl bromide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 22. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.4X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyl bromide may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 33% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not likely to be a fast environmental fate process in soil and water. Ethyl bromide will be susceptible to hydrolysis under wet soil conditions. If released into water, ethyl bromide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Aqueous hydrolysis half-lives at 20 and 25 \u00b0C are 40 and 30 days, respectively, suggesting that hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate process in water. Occupational exposure to ethyl bromide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl bromide is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population is likely to be exposed to ethyl bromide via inhalation of ambient air, with higher exposure possible in the vicinity of a manufacturing facility.

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hrs and 4 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 5(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.61(7) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Hydrolysis half-lives of 40 and 30 days at pH 7 and at 20 and 25 \u00b0C(8,9), respectively, indicate that hydrolysis is an important enviornmental fate process in water(SRC). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 33% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks(10) indicating that biodegradation is not likely to be a fast environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

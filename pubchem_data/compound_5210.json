The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

FDA has requested that Abbott Laboratories-the manufacturer of Meridia-voluntarily withdraw this drug product from the United States market. Abbott has agreed to voluntarily stop marketing of Meridia in the United States.  Meridia was FDA-approved in November 1997 for weight loss and maintenance of weight loss in patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 (=30) kg/sq m or for patients with a BMI =27 kg/sq m who have other cardiovascular risk factors. BMI is a measure of body fat in adults that is based on height and weight. Patients with a BMI =30 kg/sq m are considered obese.  FDA's recommendation is based on new data from the Sibutramine Cardiovascular Outcomes (SCOUT) trial, which demonstrated a 16% increase in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, resuscitation after cardiac arrest and cardiovascular death) in patients treated with Meridia compared to patients taking a placebo. At the end of the trial (60 months), patients in the Meridia group lost a small amount of body weight compared to patients in the placebo group. FDA has concluded that the risk for an adverse cardiovascular event from Meridia in the population studied outweighed any benefit from the modest weight loss observed with the drug.",

For the first 6 months, participants received either behavior therapy and sibutramine or behavior therapy and placebo. From months 7 to 12, all participants received sibutramine in open-label treatment. Percentage change in BMI; systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse; and hunger. In intention-to-treat analysis at month 6, participants in the behavior therapy and sibutramine group lost a mean (SD) of 7.8 kg (6.3 kg) and had an 8.5% (6.8%) reduction in BMI, which was significantly more than weight loss of 3.2 kg (6.1 kg) and reduction in BMI of 4.0% (5.4%) in the behavior therapy and placebo group. Significantly greater reductions in hunger (P =.002) also were reported by participants who received behavior therapy and sibutramine. From months 7 to 12, adolescents initially treated with sibutramine gained 0.8 kg (10.5 kg) with continued use of the medication, whereas those who switched from placebo to sibutramine lost an additional 1.3 kg (5.4 kg). Medication dose was reduced (n = 23) or discontinued (n = 10) to manage increases in blood pressure, pulse rate, or other symptoms. The addition of sibutramine to a comprehensive behavioral program induced significantly more weight loss than did behavior therapy and placebo. Until more extensive safety and efficacy data are available, medications for weight loss should be used only on an experimental basis in adolescents and children.",

Its primary mechanism of action is increased satiety, although some evidence also suggests increased energy expenditure could play a role in sibutramine-induced weight loss. It has established general efficacy in long-term trials, with clinically-approved doses of 10 and 15 mg. Sibutramine has also been studied in a number of unique populations, including obese controlled hypertensives, diabetics and ethnic minorities, further establishing its effectiveness. However, it does have a consistent effect of increasing blood pressure and pulse. Thus, blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored in patients using sibutramine and it may not be applicable in obese patients with significant cardiovascular disease.",

Sibutramine exerts its pharmacological actions predominantly via its secondary (M1) and primary (M2) amine metabolites. The parent compound, sibutramine, is a potent inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake <i>in vivo</i>, but not <i>in vitro</i>. However, metabolites M1 and M2 inhibit the reuptake of these neurotransmitters both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In human brain tissue, M1 and M2 also inhibit dopamine reuptake <i>in vitro</i>, but with ~3-fold lower potency than for the reuptake inhibition of serotonin or norepinephrine. Sibutramine, M1 and M2 exhibit no evidence of anticholinergic or antihistaminergic actions. In addition, receptor binding profiles show that sibutramine, M1 and M2 have low affinity for serotonin (5-HT<sub>1</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>), norepinephrine (b, b1, b3, a1 and a2), dopamine (D1 and D2), benzodiazepine, and glutamate (NMDA) receptors. These compounds also lack monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

This was an open, parallel-group study completed by 12 young (six male, six female; mean age 24.0 years) and 12 elderly (six male, six female; mean age 70.3 years) healthy volunteers. Blood samples were taken at intervals up to 48 hr post-dose. Plasma concentrations of metabolites were determined using HPLC-MS. Model-independent pharmacokinetic parameters of the two metabolites were compared for the two age groups. The similarity of the plasma profiles of the two desmethyl metabolites showed that despite the possibility of reduced hepatic function due to age, the rate and extent of formation of these was the same in both young and elderly, i.e. sibutramine metabolism was not impaired in elderly subjects. There were also no significant differences in elimination of metabolite 2 between groups, although the elderly group showed a slight trend for a reduction in k(el). The pharmacokinetics of the two pharmacologically active metabolites of sibutramine (metabolites 1 and 2) were not significantly different between the young and elderly groups in this study. Based on this information, a similar dosing regimen would be appropriate for both the young and elderly.",

Sibutramine (5 mg/kg, oral administration (po)) increased extracellular dopamine and 5-HT levels in rat striatum. The tricyclic antidepressant dosulepin (80 mg/kg, po or 1 uM perfusion through the striatal probe) increased 5-HT levels only. Sibutramine-induced dopamine release was antagonized by perfusion of tetrodotoxin (1 uM) through the microdialysis probe in the striatum. However, sibutramine-induced dopamine release was not inhibited by prazosin (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection (ip)), a suppressor of serotonergic activity in the striatum via blockade of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, or perfusion with nomifensine (1 uM), an inhibitor of dopamine re-uptake. These results suggest that sibutramine increases dopamine levels in the striatum by exocytotic release and not by a carrier-mediated mechanism",

Sibutramine's effects are predominantly mediated by two pharmacologically-active metabolites (its primary and secondary amines). Sibutramine and its active metabolites do not cause the release of monoamine neurotransmitters and do not have affinity for their receptors. Sibutramine dose-dependently inhibits 24 hr food intake in rats by enhancing the natural physiological process of satiety. Sibutramine also stimulates thermogenesis in rats, producing sustained (> 6 hr) increases in oxygen consumption of up to 30%. The thermogenic effect of sibutramine results from central activation of efferent sympathetic activity which, in turn, involves activation of beta 3-adrenoceptors. Sympathetic stimulation of brown adipose tissue via beta 3-adrenoceptors is thought to be the cause of the large, 18 fold increase in brown adipose tissue glucose utilization induced by sibutramine. These dual effects of sibutramine on food intake and thermogenesis explain its anti-obesity effect in animals.",

Data from animal studies also suggest that sibutramine may also increase energy expenditure through thermogenic effects in both the basal and fed states, but this has not been confirmed in humans. Sibutramine and its major pharmacologically active metabolites (M1 and M2) do not act via release of monoamines. ",

This patient was further investigated, including genotyping for long QT syndrome. Other IMMP case reports suggesting arrhythmias associated with sibutramine were assessed and further reports were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO) adverse drug reactions database. The index case displayed a novel mutation in a cardiac potassium channel subunit gene, KCNQ1, which is likely to prolong cardiac membrane depolarization and increase susceptibility to long QT intervals. Assessment of further IMMP reports identified five additional patients who experienced palpitations associated with syncope or presyncopal symptoms, one of whom had a QT(c) at the upper limit of normal. Assessment of reports from the WHO database identified three reports of QT prolongation and one fatal case of torsade de pointes in a patient also taking cisapride. This case series suggests that sibutramine may be associated with QT prolongation and related dysrhythmias. ...",

Four months after initiation of therapy, the woman developed ventricular fibrillation and was successfully resuscitated. On admission, an electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia without any ischemic changes and a prolonged QTc interval (545 msec). A subsequent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries and no other abnormalities. Her QTc interval returned to normal (432 msec) by day 2 and remained within normal limits (<440 msec) thereafter. Due to a favorable neurologic recovery and the absence of any cardiac structural abnormality, the patient was readmitted for implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator on day 35 and remained well from a cardiac and neurologic standpoint at a 2-year follow-up examination. Sibutramine acts centrally to inhibit noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin reuptake, thereby sharing similar actions of other QT interval-prolonging drugs. Therefore, sibutramine might be anticipated to also share a tendency to QT interval prolongation.",

In this study, cardiovascular effects of sibutramine (0.9, 3, or 9 mg kg(-1) i.p.) were measured in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats, in the absence and presence of beta- and/or alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism (with propranolol and/or phentolamine, respectively). Sibutramine caused pressor and tachycardic effects, with celiac and mesenteric vasoconstrictions, and hyperemic hindquarters vasodilatation. Pretreatment with propranolol inhibited the tachycardic and hindquarters vasodilator effect of sibutramine, whereas phentolamine inhibited the pressor and vasoconstrictor effects of sibutramine. In the presence of phentolamine, sibutramine caused hyperemic mesenteric vasodilatation. In preconstricted, isolated, mesenteric vessels, sibutramine and its metabolites BTS 54505 (N-desmethylsibutramine) and BTS 54354 (N-didesmethylsibutramine) (10 microM) produced significant vasodilations. Neither sibutramine nor BTS 54505 enhanced vessel sensitivity to norepinephrine, whereas BTS 54 354 produced a significant leftward shift in the concentration-response curve to norepinephrine. Collectively, the results indicate that the overt cardiovascular effects of sibutramine involve alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated celiac and mesenteric vasoconstrictions, and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated hindquarters vasodilatation and tachycardia. The mesenteric vasodilator response to sibutramine, seen in the presence of phentolamine, may be a direct effect of the drug and/or its metabolites, on vessel tone. The cardiovascular effects of sibutramine in vivo may be secondary to inhibition of peripheral and/or central reuptake of monoamines by the metabolites BTS 54354 and/or BTS 54505. It remains to explain why BTS 54354, but not BTS 54505, enhanced norepinephrine sensitivity in vitro, because both metabolites are potent inhibitors of the norepinephrine transporter.",

Postmarketing adverse effects of sibutramine were reported including abnormal ejaculation in men. This study investigates the effects of sibutramine on ejaculation and vas deferens and seminal vesicle contractility. Adult male rats received sibutramine (5; 20; or 50 mg kg(-1), ip) and after 60 min were exposed to receptive females for determination of ejaculation parameters. The vasa deferentia and seminal vesicles of untreated rats were mounted in isolated organ baths for recording of isometric contractions and HEK293 cells loaded with fluorescent calcium indicator were used to measure intracellular Ca(2+) transients. Sibutramine 5 and 20 mg kg(-1) reduced ejaculation latency whereas 50 mg kg(-1) increased ejaculation latency. Sibutramine 3 to 30 uM greatly increased the sensitivity of the seminal vesicle and vas deferens to norepinephrine, but at concentrations higher than 10 uM there were striking depressions of maximal contractions induced by norepinephrine, carbachol and CaCl(2). In HEK293 cells, sibutramine 10 to 100 uM inhibited intracellular Ca(2+) transients induced by carbachol. Depending on the doses, sibutramine either facilitates or inhibits ejaculation. Apart from its actions in the central nervous system, facilitation of ejaculation may result from augmented sensitivity of smooth muscles to norepinephrine while reductions of intracellular Ca(2+) may be involved in the delayed ejaculation observed with high doses of sibutramine.",

There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in mice or in female rats. In male rats there was a higher incidence of benign tumors of the testicular interstitial cells; such tumors are commonly seen in rats and are hormonally mediated. The relevance of these tumors to humans in not known.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

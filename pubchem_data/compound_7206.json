PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Upon subcutaneous administration of 100 mg/kg dose of 2,4-D butyl ester to four male Wistar rats, urine samples were analyzed by three analytical techniques for the presence of the butyl ester and metabolites. 2,4-D butylester was rapidly hydrolyzed in the body to form 2,4-D acid. 95% of the administered dose was excreted into the urine as the free acid within 48 hr of injection while only a small fraction (5%) was excreted over an additional 48 hr. No amino acid conjugates or the parent 2,4-D butyl ester could be detected in the urine of treated rats. A minor metabolite (< or = 2% of dose) was detected by GC-MS analysis of urine samples. This compound appears to be a side chain metabolite of the 2,4-D butyl ester. Some chemical properties of the metabolite were characterized, and a 2,4-D hydroxyethyl ester structure proposed. The mechanism of formation of this minor metabolite remains unknown.",

Similar results were reported for the hydrolysis of the n-butyl and isooctyl esters of 2,4,5-T to 2,4,5-T. Esters of 2,4-D were completely hydrolyzed to 2,4-D within 9 days in lake water.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Chicks hatched from treated eggs showed motor dysfunctions, postural troubles and edematous muscles. The electromyography revealed muscular weakness, prolonged motor distal latency, and myotonia. The biochemical composition of leg and complexus muscles from 1-day-old chicks was determined. A significant diminution (24%) in the glycogen level of leg muscles was produced by the treatment. There was a small increase (15%) in sarcoplasmic proteins from leg muscles and an increase of a 20 kD protein in the myofibrillar proteins from complexus muscles. Even though total lipid content was not changed, 2,4-D b.e. treatment produced a diminution of sterol esters (20%) and phosphatidylcholine (11%) and an increase of phosphatidylserine (61%), triglycerides (37%) and free fatty acids (FFA) (448%) in leg muscles. Increases of phosphatidylethanolamine (16%), sterols (58%) and FFA (267%) were detected in complexus muscles. A remarkable increase (700-1500%) of unsaturated FFA, e.g. oleic, linoleic and arachidonic acids, was observed. Considering the avian embryo lipid metabolism, it is proposed that FFA and triglycerides were accumulated because they could not be metabolized in the mitochondria.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Three related herbicide formulations were chosen. The first, Agent Orange, consisted only of the butyl esters of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. The second was Agent Orange diluted with diesel fuel and the third formulation tested was a tree and blackberry killer, which consisted of the butyl ester of 2,4,5-T, the ethyl ester of 2,4-D, diesel fuel and two surfactants. The potential toxic effects of these three formulations were evaluated by determining their inhibitory effects on the oxidative functions of submitochondrial particles prepared from beef heart mitochondria. The effective concentration that caused a 50% inhibition of the activities of the submitochondrial particles was determined for all three formulations. When the toxicity of the individual components of these formulations was evaluated, it was established that the so-called 'inert' components i.e. diesel fuel and surfactants contributed approximately 50% of the overall toxicity of the complete formulations. Hence the results confirm the importance of evaluating the toxicity of complete formulations, rather than only focussing on the active components. While cellular and sub-cellular assays cannot account for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes that may affect the toxicity of xenobiotics, the sub-mitochondrial particle test is useful as an initial screening assay.",

All persons were followed up in the cancer-environment register during the period 1961-79. A total of 331 cases of soft tissue sarcomas was observed in the study cohort and there were 1,508 cases in the reference group (relative risk 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.0). No subcohort of agricultural or forestry workers showed any significantly increased relative risk, nor was there any significant difference in relative risk between the subcohorts. Despite the greatly increased use of phenoxy acid herbicides from 1947 to 1970, no time-related increase in the relative risk of soft tissue sarcoma was found in the total cohort or in any of the subcohorts. /Phenoxy acid herbicides/"

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.16X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4-D butyl ester will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4-D butyl ester will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Particulate-phase 2,4-D butyl ester will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 2,4-D butyl ester absorbs light in the environmental UV spectrum and has the potential to undergo direct photolysis. If released to soil, 2,4-D butyl ester is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 530. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.9X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. 2,4-D butyl ester is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. In forest soil, 2,4-D butyl ester decomposed within 45 days. If released into water, 2,4-D butyl ester is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. In water, 2,4-D butyl ester is degraded by acclimated activated sludge at one-half the rate of 2,4-D degradation; 2,4-D reached a constant rate of oxidation in 11 weeks. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 83 days and 2.5 years, respectively. 2,4-D butyl ester is readily metabolized in fish and therefore should not bioconcentrate. 2,4-D butyl ester hydrolyzes slowly in water having a half-life of 5 days at 20 \u00b0C and pH 7.4. Occupational exposure to 2,4-D butyl ester may have occurred through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4-D butyl ester was produced or used. Agricultural workers may have been exposed to 2,4-D butyl ester during spraying operations using herbicides containing this chemical. The general population may have been exposed to 2,4-D butyl ester via inhalation of ambient air with this compound in regions where spraying was performed. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant estimated as 4.9X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 6.16X10-5 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 46 mg/l(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 83 days and 2.5 years, respectively(SRC). 2,4-D butyl ester is readily metabolized in fish and therefore should not bioconcentrate(5). 2,4-D butyl ester is degraded by acclimated activated sludge at one-half the rate of 2,4-D degradation(6); 2,4-D reached a constant rate of oxidation in 11 weeks(6). 2,4-D butyl ester hydrolyzes slowly in water having a half-life of 5 days at 20 \u00b0C and pH 7.4 (7,8). However, the formulated compound was stable for 200 hr at neutral pH(10). The hydrolysis rate increases with increasing pH, disappearing with a half-life of < 5 min at pH 11(9) and is calculated to be 0.2 days at pH 9 and 220 days at pH 6(10). Soil apparently catalyzes the hydrolysis of 2,4-D butyl ester. When it was incubated in 3 different air dried Saskatchewan soils, 70-85% and 67-78% of 2,4-D butyl ester remained after 1.5 hr and 24 hr, respectively(9). When 2,4-D butyl ester water is irradiated with light > 290 nm for 45 hr, 27% of 2,4-D butyl ester disappeared with 2- and 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 2,4-D formed at 30%, 35% and 7% yields, respectively(11). HCl which was also produced was found to be capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of 2,4-D butyl ester(11).",

Vapor-phase 2,4-D butyl ester is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.0 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.2X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase 2,4-D butyl ester may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). 2,4-D butyl ester absorbs light in the environmental spectrum(4) and has the potential for direct photolysis(SRC). When released to the atmosphere during spraying operations, there will be droplet and vapor drift(SRC). The amount of this drift as determined in a field experiment was 25-30% in a half hour after spraying, primarily as the vapor(5). Most of the ester will gravitationally settle out as spray droplets on target crops(5).",

The oxygen uptake of 2,4-D butyl ester was considerably higher than controls after 2 days when incubated with sewage seed(2). Following aerial spraying of a forest, 2,4-D butyl ester decomposed within 45 days in the soil(3). 2,4-D butyl ester was applied to soil from Washington, Wyoming and Mississippi in field mini-lysimeters from December to April 1979 (application rates of 560 and 2800 kg/ha); < 1% of the 2,4-D remained in the soil from Washington and Wyoming(4); however the degradation in the acidic Mississippi soil was greatly impeded(4). Phytotoxicity to Fagopyrum tataricum disappeared in loam and sandy loam soil within 2 weeks in non-autoclaved soil and 4 weeks in autoclaved soil(5). Even massive amounts of 2,4-D butyl ester will ultimately biodegrade in soil as is evidenced by the reduction of the ester from 1,280 and 5,900 ppm when applied in 1972 to < 10 and 10 ppm in 1975 in an Army study concerning the disposal of stocks of Agent Orange (50% 2,4-D butyl ester, and 50% 2,4,5-T)(6).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2.0 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 2,4-D butyl ester hydrolyzes slowly in water having a half-life of 5 days at 20 \u00b0C and pH 7.4(2,3). However, the formulated compound was stable for 200 hr at neutral pH(3). The hydrolysis rate increases with increasing pH, disappearing with a half-life of < 5 min at pH 11(4) and is calculated to be 0.2 days at pH 9 and 220 days at pH 6(5). Soil apparently catalyzes the hydrolysis of 2,4-D butyl ester. When it was incubated in 3 different air dried Saskatchewan soils, 70-85% and 67-78% of 2,4-D butyl ester remained after 1.5 hr and 24 hr, respectively(4). However, when the soils contained wilting point moisture levels (5-20% water), only 3-5% of 2,4-D butyl ester was recovered after 1.5 hr and none after 24 hr(4). After 4 weeks, autoclaved soil treated with 2,4-D butyl ester was not phytotoxic to buckwheat plants(6). Therefore, under field conditions with moisture levels at least at the wilting point, hydrolysis of 2,4-D butyl ester should be rapid(6). When 2,4-D butyl ester water is irradiated with light > 290 nm for 45 hr, 27% of 2,4-D butyl ester disappeared with 2- and 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 2,4-D formed at 30%, 35% and 7% yields, respectively(7). HCl which was also produced was found to be capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of 2,4-D butyl ester(7). In another study, after 94 and 188 hr in a simulated solar photoreaction, 20% and 34% decomposition occurred (in both the liquid and vapor phase, a situation which typifies a spraying operation), respectively(8). After 188 hr, 14% of the decomposition products formed were highly volatile chlorinated organics, primarily the n-butyl ester of 5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid resulting from ortho dechlorination with simultaneous reduction and rearrangement(8). Assuming first order kinetics, the half-life for decomposition of 2,4-D butyl ester is nearly 13 days(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 2,4-D butyl ester is expected to have low mobility in soil(SRC). The adsorption of 2,4-D butyl ester to several Canadian prairie soils was attempted using slurries in a batch and soil column experiment(4). 2,4-D butyl ester hydrolyzed to the acid form with a half-life of 100 hr in the batch experiment and on contact in the column experiment(4). In the column experiment, 2,4-D butyl ester leached out essentially as the acid in about an hour(4). Thin layer chromatography resulted in 2,4-D butyl ester being characterized as immobile in soils from Washington, Wyoming, and Mississippi(5). 2,4-D butyl ester is absorbed on clay minerals in the following decreasing order bentonite, illite, and kaolinite(6). The sorbed amounts were very small as is evidenced by the fact that 8.77 g of bentonite, 13.33 g of illite, or 42.73 g of kaolinite are required to reduce the concentration of 2,4-D butyl ester from 3 to 2 mg/l(6). The adsorption of 2,4-D butyl ester to flocculated humic acid is stronger than the free acid and the adsorption follows Freundlich isotherm pattern with a slope of 0.97(7). Therefore, 2,4-D butyl ester will be adsorbed more strongly in soil containing humic materials than clayey soils(SRC).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 2,4-D butyl ester is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 83 days(SRC). The volatilization half- life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 2.5 years(SRC). 2,4-D butyl ester's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 2,4-D butyl ester is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1). In a laboratory volatilization experiment (performed in a cabinet at 38 \u00b0C and at an air flow of 940 ml/min), the half-life of 2,4-D butyl ester was 46 hrs(4); the surface area to weight ratio was 3.28 sq cm/g(4). In another experiment designed to simulate a wheat field in a laboratory ecosystem, a high initial concentration of 2,4-D butyl ester in air (140 ug/cu m) was measured only 4 hrs after application(5). The level declined to 2.16 ug/cu m within 48 hr and was only minimally present after 4 days(5). After the initial loss, volatilization is unlikely because the 2,4-D is either hydrolyzed by plants or tightly combined with soil(5).",

Values over a decade of monitoring were generally between 0.01 and 1 ug/cu m, and seldom exceeded 5 ug/cu m(3). Although, 2,4-D butyl ester was detected in 50% of sampling days(3). The concn of 2,4-D butyl ester was measured as part of the National Air Pesticide Monitoring Program which covered selected areas in 14-16 states during 1970-1972. Of the 2,497 samples analyzed, 0.8% had detectable levels of 2,4-D butyl ester with a mean value of 19 ng/cu m and max value of 59.6 ng/cu m(2). Only South Dakota, North Carolina, Louisiana and Kansas had residues of 2,4-D butyl ester(2). At Pullman, WA in 1964, the avg 24-hr concn of 2,4-D butyl ester was 0.05 ug/cu m avg (max,1.04 ug/cu m max; 13 of 99 days positive); at Kennewick, WA, the avg 24-hr concn of 2,4-D butyl ester was 0.079 ug/cu m (max, 0.82 ug/cu m; 22 of 102 days positive)(3). In a study in South Central Washington, the avg concns of 2,4-D butyl ester ranged from 0.06 to 0.13 ug/cu m at 8 sites in April to June 1974; the highly volatile 2,4-D butyl ester represented 75% of the total chlorophenoxy herbicide burden(4). At Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada in the year 1972, the 33 day mean daily level of 2,4-D butyl ester (2,4-D equivalents in air) was 600 ng/cu m with a peak of 455 ug/cu m/day(5).",

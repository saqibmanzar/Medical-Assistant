When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

To investigate the direct relationship between these beneficial effects and the inhibition of the formation of NO in response to L-canavanine in endotoxin shock in the rat, we detected changes in venous nitrosyl-hemoglobin (NO-hemoglobin) levels using an electron spin resonance (ESR) assay. Anesthetized rats were injected with lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg iv). 1 hr after the lipopolysaccharide injection, the rats were divided into four groups: a lipopolysaccharide group receiving 0.3 mL of saline hourly, an L-canavanine 10 or an L-canavanine 20 group receiving L-canavanine 10 or 20 mg/kg iv hourly, respectively, and an L-NAME group receiving NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) 15 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg iv hourly. A sham group received saline instead of lipopolysaccharide, and an L-canavanine group received L-canavanine 20 mg/kg iv hourly, 1 hr after the saline injection. At 5 hr after the lipopolysaccharide or saline injection, pressor responses to noradrenaline (1 ug/kg iv) were obtained. In the lipopolysaccharide group, lipopolysaccharide caused a progressive decrease in mean arterial pressure and an impairment of pressor responsiveness to noradrenaline. Administration of L-canavanine or L-NAME attenuated the endotoxin-induced hypotension and vascular hyporeactivity to noradrenaline. L-Canavanine did not alter mean arterial pressure and the pressor response to noradrenaline in the L-canavanine group. The endotoxin-induced increases in venous levels of NO-hemoglobin were significantly inhibited by L-canavanine or L-NAME. These data indicate that the beneficial hemodynamic effects of L-canavanine are associated with inhibition of the enhanced formation of NO by inducible NO synthase in a rat model of endotoxin shock. L-Canavanine is a potential agent in the treatment of endotoxin shock.",

In such conditions, nitric oxide synthase inhibitors might be of therapeutic value, but detrimental side effects have been reported with their use, possibly related to the blockade of constitutive nitric oxide synthase. Therefore, the use of selective inhibitors of inducible nitric oxide synthase might be more suitable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of L-canavanine, a potentially selective inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, in an animal model of septic shock. Anesthetized rats were challenged with 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide intravenously. One hour later, they randomly received a 5 hr infusion of either L-canavanine (20 mg/hr/kg, n=15), nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (5 mg/hr/kg, n=13) or 0.9% NaCl (2 mL/hr/kg, n=21). Lipopolysaccharide induced a progressive fall in blood pressure and cardiac index, accompanied by a significant lactic acidosis and a marked rise in plasma nitrate. All these changes were significantly attenuated by L-canavanine, which also improved the tolerance of endotoxemic animals to acute episodes of hypovolemia. In addition, L-canavanine significantly increased survival of mice challenged with a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide. In contrast to L-canavanine, nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased blood pressure at the expense of a severe fall in cardiac index, while largely enhancing lactic acidosis. This agent did not improve survival of endotoxemic mice. In additional experiments, we found that the pressor effect of L-canavanine in advanced endotoxemia (4 hr) was reversed by L-arginine, confirming that it was related to nitric oxide synthase inhibition. In contrast, L-canavanine did not exert any influence on blood pressure in the very early stage (first hour) of endotoxemia or in the absence of lipopolysaccharide exposure, indicating a lack of constitutive nitric oxide synthase inhibition by this agent. In conclusion, L-canavanine produced beneficial hemodynamic and metabolic effects and improved survival in rodent endotoxic shock. The actions of L-canavanine were associated with a selective inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase and were in marked contrast to the deleterious consequences of nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, in similar conditions.",

Intravenous infusion of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (50 mg/kg), an inhibitor of constitutive and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase, 60 min after challenge with lipopolysaccharide, caused an immediate increase in blood pressure followed by a precipitous fall in pressure, and death. In contrast, intravenous infusion of L-canavanine (100 mg/kg), reported to be a selective inhibitor of inducible NO synthase in vitro, 60 min and 180 min after lipopolysaccharide challenge, produced an increase in mean arterial pressure and reversed the lipopolysaccharide induced hypotension. However, in lipopolysaccharide challenged animals protected from hypotension by administration of L-canavanine (60 min post challenge), intravenous infusion of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester at 180 min post challenge caused an immediate rise in mean arterial pressure, followed by a rapid fall in blood pressure and heart rate, and sudden death. In contrast, a second dose of L-canavanine at 180 min post challenge maintained blood pressure for the duration of the experiment. These findings indicate that inhibition of both constitutive and inducible NO synthase during endotoxemia is lethal. However, the use of a selective inhibitor of inducible NO synthase restores mean arterial pressure to baseline, and offers a therapeutic approach to managing hypotension in shock.",

Owing to its structural similarity to L-arginine, L-canavanine, the beta-oxa-analog of L-arginine, is a substrate for arginyl tRNA synthetase and is incorporated into nascent proteins in place of L-arginine. Although L-arginine and L-canavanine are structurally similar, the oxyguanidino group of L-canavanine is significantly less basic than the guanidino group of L-arginine. Consequently, L-canavanyl proteins lack the capacity to form crucial ionic interactions, resulting in altered protein structure and function, which leads to cellular death. Since L-canavanine is selectively sequestered by the pancreas, it may be especially useful as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This novel mechanism of cytotoxicity forms the basis for the anticancer activity of L-canavanine and thus, arginyl tRNA synthetase may represent a novel target for the development of such therapeutic agents.",

Many species are prolific canavanine producers; they divert enormous nitrogen resource to the storage of this single natural product. Canavanine, a highly effective protective allelochemical, provides a formidable chemical barrier to predation and disease. The accumulated experimental evidence leaves little doubt that the key element in the ability of canavanine to function as an effective protective allelochemical is its subtle structural mimicry of arginine which makes it an effective substrate for amino acid activation and aminoacylation, and its marked diminution in basicity relative to arginine which mediates the production of structural aberrant, dysfunctional canavanyl proteins. The biological burdens of canavanyl protein formation by canavanine-treated Manduca sexta larvae were carried throughout their remaining life cycle. Protein-based sequestration of canavanine prevented turnover and clearance of the free amino acid, and undoubtedly contributed significantly to the antimetabolic character of this protective allelochemical.",

This natural product was only slightly toxic to Sprague-Dawley rats following a single sc injection: the LD50 was 5.9 +/- 1 8 g/kg in adult rats and 5.0 +/- 1.0 g/kg in 10-day-old rats. Following a single dose of 2.0 g/kg, the systemic clearance value for canavanine in adult rats was 0.114 liter/hr, the volume of distribution at steady state was 0.154 liter, and the half-life was 1.56 hr. Forty-eight percent of the dose was excreted unaltered in the urine following an iv injection, and 16% of a sc dose was recovered in the urine. Bioavailability of a 2.0 g/kg sc dose was 72%. Single oral doses of canavanine were less toxic to adult rats than sc injections. Bioavailability of a 2.0 g/kg po dose was 43%, and only 1% of the administered canavanine was recovered in the urine. Twenty-one percent of the administered canavanine remained in the gastrointestinal tract 24 hr after an oral dose. Less than 1% of a 2.0 g/kg dose of L-[guanidinooxy-(14)C]canavanine was incorporated into the proteins of adult and neonatal rats 4 or 24 hr following administration. Repeated sc administration of canavanine resulted in more severe toxicity. Weight loss and alopecia were observed in rats given daily sc canavanine injections for 7 days. Food intake was decreased by 80% in adult rats subjected to this dosing regimen, but returned to normal after canavanine injections were terminated. Histological studies of tissues from adult rats treated with 3.0 g/kg canavanine daily for 6 days revealed pancreatic acinar cell atrophy and fibrosis. Serum amylase and lipase levels were elevated following one sc injection of 2.0 g/kg canavanine; after three daily injections both serum enzymes were depleted. Elevations in serum glucose and urea nitrogen, and depletion of cholesterol, were observed. The most significant changes were severe attenuations of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase activity.",

CAV becomes incorporated into cellular proteins of MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells and the aberrant, canavanyl proteins are not preferentially degraded. Hydrolytic cleavage of CAV to canaline (CAN) and urea is mediated by arginase. CAN is a potent metabolite that inactivates vitamin B6-containing enzymes and may inhibit cell growth. To determine the presence of arginase and its specificity for ARG and CAV in MIA PaCa-2 cells, a radiometric assay, which quantifies the (14)C released from the hydrolytic cleavage of L-[guanidino-(14)C]ARG or L-[guanidinooxy-(14)C]CAV mediated by arginase, was employed. Insignificant amounts of (14)CO2 were released when cells were exposed to [(14)C]CAV or to [(14)C]ARG. Pancreatic cancer cells secrete a negligible amount of arginase. Cytotoxic effects of CAN and CAV were compared on cells exposed to varying concentrations of ARG. These studies provide evidence that CAV's cytotoxic effects on MIA PaCa-2 cells cannot be attributed to conversion to the active metabolite CAN. A slower and decreased hydrolysis of CAV by arginase allows CAV to persist and increases its chances of incorporating into proteins in these cells. Lack of considerable amounts of arginase in the pancreas makes CAV a worthy candidate for further studies in pancreatic cancer.",

Since the immunotoxic evaluation of agents in development is a critical component of the drug development process, the antiproliferative effects of L-canavanine and L-canaline were evaluated in vitro. Both L-canavanine and L-canaline were cytotoxic to peripheral blood mononucleocytes (PBMCs) in culture. Additionally, the mononucleocytes were concurrently exposed to either L-canavanine or L-canaline and each one of a series of compounds that may act as metabolic inhibitors of the action of L-canavanine and L-canaline (L-arginine, L-ornithine, D-arginine, L-lysine, L-homoarginine, putrescine, L-omega-nitro arginine methyl ester, and L-citrulline). The capacity of these compounds to overcome the cytotoxic effects of L-canavanine or L-canaline was assessed in order to provide insight into the biochemical mechanisms that may underlie the toxicity of these two novel anticancer agents. The results of these studies suggest that the mechanism of L-canavanine toxicity is mediated through L-arginine-utilizing mechanisms and that the L-canavanine metabolite, L-canaline, is toxic to human PBMCs by disrupting polyamine biosynthesis. The elucidation of the biochemical mechanisms associated with the effects of L-canavanine and L-canaline on lymphoproliferation may be useful for maximizing the therapeutic effectiveness and minimizing the toxicity of these novel anticancer agents.",

L-Canavanine, provided at 2.0 g/kg, was supplemented with 5 uCi of L-[guanidinooxy-(14)C]canavanine (58 uCi/mumol) and administered iv, sc, or orally to female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately 200 g. 14C recovery in the urine at 24 hr was 83, 68, or 61%, respectively, of the administered dose. Another 5-8% of the (14)C was expired as (14)CO2. The gastrointestinal tract contained 21% of orally administered (14)C. Serum, feces, tissues, and de novo synthesized proteins only accounted for a few percent of the original dose by any administrative route. Analysis of the (14)C-containing urinary metabolites revealed that [(14)C] urea accounted for 88% of the urinary radioactivity for an iv injection, 75% for sc administration, and 50% following an oral dose. By all routes of administration, [(14)C]guanidine represented 5% of the radioactivity in the urine and [(14)C]guanidinoacetic acid accounted for 2%. Serum and urine amino acid analysis showed a markedly elevated ornithine level. Basic amino acids such as histidine, lysine, and arginine were also higher in the urine. Plasma ammonia levels were determined following oral canavanine doses of 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 g/kg. A rapid but transient elevation in plasma ammonia was observed only at the 4.0 g/kg dose. This indicates that elevated plasma ammonia is not a likely cause of canavanine toxicity at the drug concentrations used in this study.",

The present work shows that hydroxyguanidine is formed by a nonenzymatic beta,gamma-elimination reaction following enzymatic oxidation at the alpha-C and that the abstraction of the beta-H is general-base catalyzed. The elimination reaction requires the presence in the alpha-position of an anion-stabilizing group--the protonated imino group (iminium ion group) or the carbonyl group. The iminium ion group is more activating than the carbonyl group. Elimination is further facilitated by protonation of the guanidinooxy group. The other product formed in the elimination reaction was identified as vinylglyoxylate (2-oxo-3-butenoate), a very highly electrophilic substance. The product resulting from hydrolysis following oxidation was identified as alpha-keto-gamma-guanidinooxybutyrate (ketocanavanine). The ratio of hydroxyguanidine to ketocanavanine depended upon the concentration and degree of basicity of the basic catalyst and on pH. In the presence of semicarbazide, the elimination reaction was prevented because the imino group in the semicarbazone derivative of ketocanavanine is not significantly protonated. Incubation of canavanine with 5'-deoxypyridoxal also yielded hydroxyguanidine. Since the elimination reactions take place under mild conditions, they may occur in vivo following oxidation at the alpha-C of L-canavanine (ingested or formed endogenously) or of other amino acids with a good leaving group in the gamma-position (e.g., S-adenosylmethionine, methionine sulfoximine, homocyst(e)ine, or cysteine-homocysteine mixed disulfide) by an L-amino acid oxidase, a transaminase, or a dehydrogenase. Therefore, vinylglyoxylate may be a normal metabolite in mammals which at elevated concentrations may contribute to the in vivo toxicity of canavanine and of some of the other above-mentioned amino acids.",

This investigation evaluated the natural abundance of this anti-cancer compound in commercially available sprouts, and in ten varieties of the seed of alfalfa, Medicago sativa (L.). Canavanine abundance in commercially grown sprouts varied according to the source; the young plant stored appreciable canavanine that ranged from 1.3 to 2.4% of the dry matter. Alfalfa seeds were also rich in this nonprotein amino acid as the canavanine content varied from 1.4 to 1.8% of the dry matter. On average, the tested seeds contained 1.54 =/- 0.03% canavanine. Alfalfa seed canavanine content was comparable to the levels found in the seeds of representative members of the genus Canavalia, which are amongst the more abundance sources of this antimetabolite.",

This quick method was used to identify canavanine (sensitivity 50 microg) from irradiated and nonirradiated alfalfa and clover seed extracts and alfalfa sprout water.

The aim of the present study was to determine the ability of different processing methods to reduce canavanine in sword beans (Canavalia gladiata). For this purpose a method for the detection and quantification of canavanine was developed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of the dabsylated derivatives. The recovery of canavanine using this method was 88-91%. Optimum extraction of canavanine from raw and processed beans was obtained by addition of hot water prior to overnight soaking. The results obtained with this method agree well with previously published values for raw seeds. The method is sensitive, specific and can successfully be applied to the detection of canavanine in legumes. Overnight soaking and boiling in excess water followed by decanting gave the most pronounced reduction in canavanine content (around 50%), followed by boiling and decanting excess water (34%). Roasting as used in this study and autoclaving were less effective in reducing the canavanine content.",

It is a potentially toxic antimetabolite of L-arginine that is stored by many leguminous plants. It has demonstrative antineoplastic activity against a number of animal-bearing carcinomas and cancer cell lines. L-canavanine has been used as an experimental medication. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: L-Canavanine is a naturally occurring L-amino acid that interferes with L-arginine-utilizing enzymes owing to its structural analogy with this L-amino acid. In macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), L-canavanine is able to prevent the L-arginine-derived synthesis of nitric oxide (NO). L-canavanine exerts differential effects on human platelets in relation to the concentrations: at low levels, it exerts antiaggregating effects by actions independent of NOS inhibition, whereas, at high levels, it inhibits NO synthesis and does not exert antiaggregating effects. L-canavanine was cytotoxic to human peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes (PBMCs) in culture. The results of these studies suggest that the mechanism of L-canavanine toxicity is mediated through L-arginine-utilizing mechanisms and that the L-canavanine metabolite, L-canaline, is toxic to human PBMCs by disrupting polyamine biosynthesis. ANIMAL STUDIES: It was only slightly toxic to rats following a single sc injection: the LD50 was 5.9 +/- 1 8 g/kg in adult rats and 5.0 +/- 1.0 g/kg in 10-day-old rats. Repeated sc administration of canavanine resulted in more severe toxicity. Weight loss and alopecia were observed in rats given daily sc canavanine injections for 7 days. Food intake was decreased by 80% in adult rats subjected to this dosing regimen, but returned to normal after canavanine injections were terminated. Histological studies of tissues from adult rats treated with 3.0 g/kg canavanine daily for 6 days revealed pancreatic acinar cell atrophy and fibrosis. Serum amylase and lipase levels were elevated following one sc injection of 2.0 g/kg canavanine; after three daily injections both serum enzymes were depleted. Elevations in serum glucose and urea nitrogen, and depletion of cholesterol, were observed. The most significant changes were severe attenuations of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase activity. Eighteen female mice were fed a diet containing 1.56% canavanine sulphate (1% base) and eighteen others were fed a control diet from day 84 to day 477 of age. Four g/d/mouse diet were fed from day 84 to day 164 of age and 5 g/d/mouse were fed thereafter. Only 6 of 10 canavanine-fed  mice with copulatory plugs (vs 5 of 5 controls) carried any pups to 17d of gestation. Counts of corpora lutea, embryos and resorption sites indicate that these significant effects on pregnancy may have been due to failure of implantation. Only 50% of control mice and a full 89% of canavanine-fed mice survived to 477 days of age. These results indicate that canavanine may extend the life of mice, but interferes with their reproduction. Mutagenic activities of l-canavanine and metabolite l-canaline on Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and Bacillus subtilis h 17 rec+ & M 45 rec- were investigated in order to elucidate the mechanism of cytotoxicity of each compound. Both compounds and their metabolites obtained from rat liver homogenate did not cause base-pair substitutions and frameshift activities on DNA structure. Apparently, the compounds do not act on DNA directly, but other mechanisms, such as formation of l-canavanine-containing proteins, appear to influence DNA metabolism. Canavanine induced marked growth inhibition of the rat colon carcinoma.",

Swiss albino mice (20-40 g) were administered intraperitoneally bosentan (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg), aminoguanidine (15 mg/kg) or L-canavanine (20 or 100 mg/kg) 10 min before they received saline or Escherichia coli endotoxin (10 mg/kg). After 4 hr, the mice were anesthetized, mesenteric blood flow values were measured, spleen and liver weight/body weight ratios were determined and the organs were examined histopathologically. Endotoxin decreased mesenteric blood flow (mL/min), saline: 3.0 +/- 0.2; endotoxin: 2.2 +/- 0.2: n=10, p<0.05), increased the weight of liver (g per kg body weight, saline: 47.5 +/- 2.0; endotoxin: 60.8 +/- 1.9: n=10, p<0.05) and spleen (g per kg body weight, saline: 3.9 +/- 0.5; endotoxin: 8.6 +/- 0.9; n=10, p<0.01) while it inflicted significant histopathological injury to both organs. Bosentan was ineffective at 3 mg/kg but at 10 and 30 mg/kg doses, it abolished all the deleterious effects of endotoxin without exception. Aminoguanidine blocked most of the effects of endotoxin except those on spleen. In contrast, L-canavanine blocked only the endotoxin-induced increase in liver weight but itself increased spleen weight and failed to block any other effects of endotoxin. Thus, it can be speculated that the beneficial effects of aminoguanidine are produced largely by mechanisms other than selective inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibition since L-canavanine was not fully effective. The beneficial effects of endothelin inhibition by using bosentan in endotoxemia can be further exploited for the understanding and the therapy of sepsis-related syndromes.",

Endotoxin infusion (2.5 mg kg-1 hr-1 over 6 hr) produced progressive and marked hypotension and hypoglycemia. Electron microscopy showed marked changes in the kidney, comprising severe endothelial cell disruption and the accumulation of platelets in the blood vessels. In the lung, there was marked accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in small blood vessels and endothelial disruption. Treatment with L-canavanine (10 mg kg-1 by bolus injection each hour starting 70 min after endotoxin or saline infusion) significantly reduced endotoxin-induced hypotension, without any effect on the hypoglycemia. This treatment markedly reduced the endotoxin-induced electron microscopical changes in the kidneys and lungs. Although L-canavanine, like L-NAME, inhibited both cerebellar constitute and splenic inducible nitric oxide synthase in vitro, in contrast to L-NAME it did not modify either arterial blood pressure or carotid artery blood flow in control rats. The data are consistent with L-canavanine being a selective inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, at least in vivo, and suggest that inhibitors of this enzyme may be beneficial in endotoxin-induced shock.",

Both chemicals induce a similar pattern of alterations in different RNP structures as well as in both RNA and protein synthesis. Pulse and chase autoradiographic experiments reveal that both canavanine and cadmium induce a preferential inhibition of nucleolar RNA synthesis and a slowdown in the transport or processing of nucleolar and extranucleolar RNA. Nucleoli become round and compact. Accumulation of perichromatin granules and fibrils occurs, there is a depletion of interchromatin fibrils, and nuclear formations appear which seem to be involved in the morphogenesis of perichromatin granules accumulated during the treatments. The appearance of clusters of 29- to 35-nm granules might be related with a deficient assembling of constituents of perichromatin granules. The effects of different inhibitors of the transcriptional processes on the accumulation of perichromatin granules suggest that these granules represent a particular subpopulation of hnRNP.",

Using the human colonic tumor cell line, HT-29, time-dose studies were performed with log-phase cultures in order to determine conditions which maximize the incorporation of L-canavanine into cellular proteins while leaving a large fraction of the cells viable for subsequent gamma-ray survival measurements. At an input ratio of 2.5 (L-canavanine:arginine), the analogue exerted a cytostatic effect on the cells for at least 6 days following one cell division. Little cell killing (less than 20%) by clonogenicity was caused by L-canavanine during the first 12 hr of treatment of log-phase cells, even at a L-canavanine:arginine ratio of 20. A 24-hr exposure, however, produced an exponential decrease in survival as a function of L-canavanine concentration. The interaction between L-canavanine treatment and gamma-ray damage with respect to cell survival was examined under several conditions and times based on the above findings. Optimal enhancement of X-ray-induced cytotoxicity (assayed by loss of clonogenicity) was observed with a 48-hr exposure to the analogue at a L-canavanine:arginine ratio of 10. A marked increase in radiosensitivity was observed when L-canavanine was administered either before or after irradiation of the cells. In both protocols, enhancement was seen at all radiation doses. Together with our earlier findings showing the antitumor activity of L-canavanine in L1210 murine leukemia, these results suggest the potential usefulness of this amino acid analogue in the treatment of cancer.",

Our objective was to confirm or disprove the presence of L-canavanine (a nonprotein amino acid known to induce systemic lupuslike symptoms in humans) in H. alpinum seeds. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of H. alpinum seeds was performed. Our analysis confirmed the presence of L-canavanine in H. alpinum seeds and demonstrated that it is a significant component of the seeds, with a concentration of 1.2% (weight/weight), roughly half of that found in Canavalia ensiformis. The data led us to conclude it is highly likely that the consumption of H alpinum seeds contributed to the death of Chris McCandless.",

Since the immunotoxic evaluation of agents in development is a critical component of the drug development process, the antiproliferative effects of L-canavanine and L-canaline were evaluated in vitro. Both L-canavanine and L-canaline were cytotoxic to peripheral blood mononucleocytes (PBMCs) in culture. Additionally, the mononucleocytes were concurrently exposed to either L-canavanine or L-canaline and each one of a series of compounds that may act as metabolic inhibitors of the action of L-canavanine and L-canaline (L-arginine, L-ornithine, D-arginine, L-lysine, L-homoarginine, putrescine, L-omega-nitro arginine methyl ester, and L-citrulline). The capacity of these compounds to overcome the cytotoxic effects of L-canavanine or L-canaline was assessed in order to provide insight into the biochemical mechanisms that may underlie the toxicity of these two novel anticancer agents. The results of these studies suggest that the mechanism of L-canavanine toxicity is mediated through L-arginine-utilizing mechanisms and that the L-canavanine metabolite, L-canaline, is toxic to human PBMCs by disrupting polyamine biosynthesis. The elucidation of the biochemical mechanisms associated with the effects of L-canavanine and L-canaline on lymphoproliferation may be useful for maximizing the therapeutic effectiveness and minimizing the toxicity of these novel anticancer agents.",

CAV can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, but little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms mediating these effects. We demonstrated that the treatment of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells with CAV caused growth inhibition; G1 phase arrest is accompanied by accumulation of an incompletely phosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma protein, whose phosphorylation is necessary for cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. In addition, CAV induces the expression of p53 and subsequent expression of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21/WAF1. The p53-dependent induction of p21/WAF1 and the following dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by CAV could account for the observed CAV-mediated G1 phase arrest.",

CAV becomes incorporated into cellular proteins of MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells and the aberrant, canavanyl proteins are not preferentially degraded. Hydrolytic cleavage of CAV to canaline (CAN) and urea is mediated by arginase. CAN is a potent metabolite that inactivates vitamin B6-containing enzymes and may inhibit cell growth. To determine the presence of arginase and its specificity for ARG and CAV in MIA PaCa-2 cells, a radiometric assay, which quantifies the (14)C released from the hydrolytic cleavage of L-[guanidino-(14)C]ARG or L-[guanidinooxy-(14)C]CAV mediated by arginase, was employed. Insignificant amounts of (14)CO2 were released when cells were exposed to [(14)C]CAV or to [(14)C]ARG. Pancreatic cancer cells secrete a negligible amount of arginase. Cytotoxic effects of CAN and CAV were compared on cells exposed to varying concentrations of ARG. These studies provide evidence that CAV's cytotoxic effects on MIA PaCa-2 cells cannot be attributed to conversion to the active metabolite CAN. A slower and decreased hydrolysis of CAV by arginase allows CAV to persist and increases its chances of incorporating into proteins in these cells. Lack of considerable amounts of arginase in the pancreas makes CAV a worthy candidate for further studies in pancreatic cancer.",

This natural product was only slightly toxic to Sprague-Dawley rats following a single sc injection: the LD50 was 5.9 +/- 1 8 g/kg in adult rats and 5.0 +/- 1.0 g/kg in 10-day-old rats. Following a single dose of 2.0 g/kg, the systemic clearance value for canavanine in adult rats was 0.114 liter/hr, the volume of distribution at steady state was 0.154 liter, and the half-life was 1.56 hr. Forty-eight percent of the dose was excreted unaltered in the urine following an iv injection, and 16% of a sc dose was recovered in the urine. Bioavailability of a 2.0 g/kg sc dose was 72%. Single oral doses of canavanine were less toxic to adult rats than sc injections. Bioavailability of a 2.0 g/kg po dose was 43%, and only 1% of the administered canavanine was recovered in the urine. Twenty-one percent of the administered canavanine remained in the gastrointestinal tract 24 hr after an oral dose. Less than 1% of a 2.0 g/kg dose of L-[guanidinooxy-(14)C]canavanine was incorporated into the proteins of adult and neonatal rats 4 or 24 hr following administration. Repeated sc administration of canavanine resulted in more severe toxicity. Weight loss and alopecia were observed in rats given daily sc canavanine injections for 7 days. Food intake was decreased by 80% in adult rats subjected to this dosing regimen, but returned to normal after canavanine injections were terminated. Histological studies of tissues from adult rats treated with 3.0 g/kg canavanine daily for 6 days revealed pancreatic acinar cell atrophy and fibrosis. Serum amylase and lipase levels were elevated following one sc injection of 2.0 g/kg canavanine; after three daily injections both serum enzymes were depleted. Elevations in serum glucose and urea nitrogen, and depletion of cholesterol, were observed. The most significant changes were severe attenuations of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase activity.",

We investigated the effects of L-canavanine on performance and select metabolic responses of growing chicks. Canavanine was added to a control diet, in an amount equivalent to that provided by 300 g raw canavalia seeds/kg diet (10 g free base canavanine/kg diet). Growth, plasma basic amino acids and kidney arginase, activity were measured. The incorporation of canavanine into a nutritionally balanced diet for growing chicks depressed feed intake and growth by approximately 25% (p<0.01) compared with the control diet. Performance was unaffected by equimolar amounts of arginine. Canavanine exerted its growth-depressing effect exclusively by reducing feed intake, because this effect was not observed in a pair-feeding experiment. Chicks fed a diet containing 473 mmol canavanine sulfate/kg for 11 d were given an intracrop dose of 946 mmol of canavanine sulfate or arginine hydrochloride. In both cases, plasma histidine and lysine concentrations were significantly decreased compared with a placebo group dosed with water. Plasma arginine concentration was unaffected by the canavanine sulfate dose but, as expected, was significantly increased by the arginine hydrochloride dose. Free base canavanine significantly (p<0.05) reduced kidney arginase activity. No overt toxic effects were observed at any point during the study. These data indicate that, although canavanine is not the principal antinutritional factor in Canavalia ensiformis seeds, its presence in the diet precludes optimum performance of chicks.",

The 1 and 10% lethal dose values following a single sc injection in Fischer rats were 4.75 and 5.57 g/kg, respectively. Rats received sc injections of a 10% (w/v) tumor cell suspension. When the tumors reached a size of 500 to 1000 cu mm, the rats received canavanine, 2.0 g/kg or 3.0 g/kg sc daily for 5 or daily for 9 days. Control animals received a 0.9% NaCl solution. Administration of canavanine, 2.0 g/kg for 5 days produced a treated versus control of 23%; the treated versus control for 9 days was 14%. The 3.0-g/kg dosing regimen resulted in a treated versus control value of -13% after 5 days and -8% after 9 days. The negative values indicated regression of the tumor. The reduction in tumor volume, expressed as the percentage of regression, was 22% in animals receiving canavanine, 3.0 g/kg daily for 5 days and 60% in the 3.0-g/kg-daily-for-9-days treatment group. Cumulative toxicity caused death in 2 of 5 animals in the 3.0-g/kg-for-9-days treatment group; the average weight loss was 31%. The 3.0-g/kg-for-5-days treatment also produced undesirable cumulative toxicity as indicated by a weight loss of 19%. Cumulative toxicity was reduced greatly when canavanine was administered at a dose level of 2.0 g/kg for 5 days (weight loss of 13%). Analysis of the relationship of caloric deprivation to tumor growth reduction established that canavanine-mediated curtailment of tumor growth was not caused by reduced food intake and its associated loss in body weight. Histological examination of tissues from rats receiving canavanine, 2.0 or 3.0 g/kg daily for 5 or 9 days failed to reveal lesions in any of the examined tissues, except for varying degrees of pancreatic acinar atrophy. All other tissues appeared normal. The white and red blood cell values of canavanine-treated rats were also normal following 1, 3, or 6 injections of canavanine, 2.0 or 3.0 g/kg. The results indicated that canavanine induced marked growth inhibition of the rat colon carcinoma. Our experiments also disclosed that further studies must be conducted to optimize the dosing schedule to enhance drug efficacy and to reduce its cumulative toxicity.",

L-Canavanine is a basic amino acid which occurs naturally in some species of beans and alfalfa. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.2X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates L-canavanine will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase L-canavanine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. L-canavanine does not contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, L-canavanine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 17. The estimated pKa values of L-canavanine are 2.10 and 9.31, indicating that this compound will exist as a zwitterion in the environment and zwitterions generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an ion and ions do not volatilize. L-Canavanine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, L-canavanine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The estimated pKa values indicate L-canavanine will exist as a zwitterion at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to L-canavanine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where L-canavanine is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to L-canavanine via ingestion of food. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

An observational cohort study was performed in two tertiary referral high-risk obstetric medicine clinics. Fourteen women taking tacrolimus during pregnancy and lactation, and their 15 infants, 11 of whom were exclusively breast-fed, were assessed. Tacrolimus levels were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Samples from mothers and cord blood were collected at delivery and from mothers, infants, and breast milk postnatally where possible. All infants with serial sampling had a decline in tacrolimus level, which was approximately 15% per day (ratio of geometric mean concentrations 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.88; P<0.001). Breast-fed infants did not have higher tacrolimus levels compared with bottle-fed infants (median 1.3 ug/L [range, 0.0-4.0] versus 1.0 ug/L (range, 0.0-2.3), respectively; P=0.91). Maximum estimated absorption from breast milk is 0.23% of maternal dose (weight-adjusted). Ingestion of tacrolimus by infants via breast milk is negligible. Breastfeeding does not appear to slow the decline of infant tacrolimus levels from higher levels present at birth.",

The mean umbilical cord venous plasma (0.09 + or - 0.04 ng ml(-1)) and unbound drug concentrations (0.003 + or - 0.001 ng ml(-1)) were approximately one fifth of the respective maternal concentrations. Arterial umbilical cord blood concentrations of tacrolimus were 100 + or - 12% of umbilical venous concentrations. In addition, infant exposure to tacrolimus through the breast milk was less than 0.3% of the mother's weight-adjusted dose. Differences between maternal and umbilical cord tacrolimus concentrations may be explained in part by placental P-gp function, greater red blood cell partitioning and higher haematocrit levels in venous cord blood.",

Tacrolimus is bound mainly to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and has a high level of association with erythrocytes. The distribution of tacrolimus between whole blood and plasma depends on several factors, such as hematocrit, temperature at the time of plasma separation, drug concentration, and plasma protein concentration. In a US study, the ratio of whole blood concentration to plasma concentration averaged 35 (range 12 to 67).  There was no evidence based on blood concentrations that tacrolimus accumulates systemically upon intermittent topical application for periods of up to 1 year. As with other topical calcineurin inhibitors, it is not known whether tacrolimus is distributed into the lymphatic system.",

The major metabolite identified in incubations with human liver microsomes is 13-demethyl tacrolimus. In in vitro studies, a 31-demethyl metabolite has been reported to have the same activity as tacrolimus.",

Although structurally unrelated to cyclosporin A (CsA), its mode of action is similar. It exerts its effects principally through impairment of gene expression in target cells. Tacrolimus bonds to an immunophilin, FK506 binding protein (FKBP). This complex inhibits calcineurin phosphatase. The drug inhibits calcium-dependent events, such as interleukin-2 gene transcription, nitric oxide synthase activation, cell degranulation, and apoptosis. Tacrolimus also potentiates the actions of glucocorticoids and progesterone by binding to FKBPs contained within the hormone receptor complex, preventing degradation. The agent may enhance expression of the transforming growth factor beta-1 gene in a fashion analogous to that demonstrated for CsA. T cell proliferation in response to ligation of the T cell receptor is inhibited by tacrolimus. Type 1 T helper cells appear to be preferentially suppressed compared with type 2 T helper cells. T cell-mediated cytotoxicity is impaired. B cell growth and antibody production are affected indirectly by the suppression of T cell-derived growth factors necessary for these functions. Antigen presentation appears to be spared. ...",

It is a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant available in several preparations. Tacrolimus in both oral capsules and a solution for IV injection is used for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving liver, kidney or heart transplants. Tacrolimus topical ointment is used as a second-line therapy for the short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised adults and children. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: While most acute overdosages of tacrolimus at up to 30 times the intended dose have been asymptomatic and all patients recovered with no sequelae, some acute overdosages were followed by adverse reactions including  tremors, abnormal renal function, hypertension, and peripheral edema. At therapeutic doses, patients receiving tacrolimus are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, as well as an increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including  fatal, outcomes. While there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, the use of tacrolimus during pregnancy in humans has been associated with neonatal hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction. ANIMAL STUDIES: Both rats and baboons showed a similar toxicologic profile following oral or intravenous administration of tacrolimus. Toxicity following intravenous administration was evident at lower doses than after oral administration for both rats and baboons. Toxicity was seen at lower doses in rats than in baboons. The primary target organs were the kidneys, pancreatic islets of Langerhans and exocrine pancreas, spleen, thymus, gastrointestinal tract, and lymph nodes. In addition, decreases in erythrocyte parameters were seen. Tacrolimus also produced reproductive and developmental toxicity in both rats and rabbits. In rats, chronic oral administration of tacrolimus at high doses resulted in changes in sex organs, and glaucoma/eye changes. Oral doses of tacrolimus at 1 and 3.2 mg/kg/day produced overt signs of parental toxicity and changes in the fertility and general reproductive performance of rats. Effects on reproduction included some embryo lethality, reduced number of implantations, increased incidence of post-implantation loss, and reduced embryo and offspring viability. In a rabbit teratology study, signs of maternal toxicity including reduced body weight were produced at all oral doses of tacrolimus administered (0.1, 0.32, or 1 mg/kg/day). Doses of 0.32 and 1 mg/kg/day produced signs of developmental toxicity, such as increased incidence of post-implantation losses, reduced number of viable fetuses, and increased incidences of morphological variations. In a rat teratology study, increased post-implantation loss was observed at 3.2 mg/kg/day. Maternal doses of 1 mg/kg/day decreased the body weight of F1 offspring. Decreased body weight, reduced survival number, and some skeletal alterations were seen in F1 offspring at maternal doses of 3.2 mg/kg/day. Tacrolimus did not exhibit genotoxic activity in vitro in bacterial asaays in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli or mammalian assays in Chinese hamster lung-derived cells assays. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro in the CHO/HGPRT assay (the Chinese hamster ovary cell assay (CHO), which measures forward mutation of the HGPRT locus) or in vivo in clastogenicity assays performed in mice. Tacrolimus also did not cause unscheduled DNA synthesis in rodent hepatocytes.",

Current guidelines allow topical tacrolimus to be applied to the nipples just after nursing, with the nipples cleaned gently before nursing.

Median serum testosterone levels (0.121 vs 0.137 mcg/L) and serum cortisol levels (82.5 vs 105 mg/L) were also significantly lower in the tacrolimus group. The reduced prolactin may be caused by inhibition of the transcription of the human prolactin gene. Not all studies have found a reduction in serum prolactin with tacrolimus.

The utilization of phenytoin to assist in decreasing tacrolimus concentrations in a case series of four solid organ transplant recipients with acute, symptomatic tacrolimus toxicity presenting with elevated serum creatinine, potassium, and tacrolimus trough concentrations greater than 30 ng/mL /is reported/. All four patients had the potential causative agents stopped or temporarily held and were given ... phenytoin for two to three days. Within three days of beginning phenytoin, all four patients had a decrease in tacrolimus concentration to less than 15 ng/mL, a return to or near baseline creatinine concentration, and lack of phenytoin-related side effects. Therefore, phenytoin appears to be a safe and potentially beneficial treatment option in patients with symptomatic tacrolimus toxicity.",

Mice (56/sex) were administered FK506 as a dietary admix at doses of 0 (control), 0 (placebo), 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of any tumorigenic potential of FK506 in this study. Signs of toxicity were evident in the form of reduced bodyweight gain in both sexes receiving 3.0 mg/kg/day and for males receiving 1 mg/kg/day. For males receiving 3.0 mg/kg/day, there was a reduction in the efficiency of food utilization. An increase in mortality for males at 3.0 mg/kg/day was accompanied by pathological findings of minimal adipose tissue and fur staining, evidence of dysfunctional testes/epididymides, prostate glands and seminal vesicles. Males and females at 3.0 mg/kg/day also demonstrated reduced islets of Langerhans and increased basophilia and cellularity of islets. The no-effect level was considered to be 0.3 mg/kg/day in both sexes. In addition, 1 mg/kg/day was a no-effect level for females only.",

An observational cohort study was performed in two tertiary referral high-risk obstetric medicine clinics. Fourteen women taking tacrolimus during pregnancy and lactation, and their 15 infants, 11 of whom were exclusively breast-fed, were assessed. Tacrolimus levels were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Samples from mothers and cord blood were collected at delivery and from mothers, infants, and breast milk postnatally where possible. All infants with serial sampling had a decline in tacrolimus level, which was approximately 15% per day (ratio of geometric mean concentrations 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.88; P<0.001). Breast-fed infants did not have higher tacrolimus levels compared with bottle-fed infants (median 1.3 ug/L [range, 0.0-4.0] versus 1.0 ug/L (range, 0.0-2.3), respectively; P=0.91). Maximum estimated absorption from breast milk is 0.23% of maternal dose (weight-adjusted). Ingestion of tacrolimus by infants via breast milk is negligible. Breastfeeding does not appear to slow the decline of infant tacrolimus levels from higher levels present at birth.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It not is expected to volatilize from either moist or dry soil to the atmosphere. Limited laboratory data indicate that it has the potential to biodegrade in soil under anaerobic conditions. If released to water, m-nitroacetophenone is not expected to volatilize to the atmosphere. The estimated half-life for volatilization from a model river is 517 days. m-Nitroacetophenone is not expected to bioconcentrate in fish and aquatic organisms nor is it expected to adsorb to sediment and suspended organic matter. Limited laboratory data indicate that it has the potential to biodegrade in water under anaerobic conditions. If released to the atmosphere, m-nitroacetophenone may undergo atmospheric removal by a slow reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals; the estimated half-life for this process is 55 days. m-Nitroacetophenone may also undergo atmospheric removal by wet deposition processes.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

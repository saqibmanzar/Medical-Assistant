They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, protriptyline does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, protriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TCAs down-regulate cerebral cortical \u03b2-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H1 receptors, alpha1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Protriptyline may be used for the treatment of depression.",

They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, protriptyline does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, protriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TCAs down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Protriptyline may be used for the treatment of depression. ",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by inhibiting the reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. The effectiveness of antidepressants appear after approximately two weeks following recommended adminsitration schedule. Gradual changes are thought to occur in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, involved in emotion regulation as part of the limbic system, as receptor sensitivity is enhanced. While &alpha;<sub>1</sub> and &beta;<sub>1</sub> receptors are sensitized, &alpha;<sub>2</sub> receptors are desensitized (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also reported to alter the perceptions of pain, including neuropathic or neuralgic pain, so they may exhibit analgesic properties. The mechanism of action behind this analgesic property is not fully understood; however, it is thought to involve modulation of endogenous opioid systems in the CNS via an indirect serotonergic route. Tricyclic antidepressants are also effective in relieving migraine prophylaxis, but not in abortion of acute migraine attack, potentially via their serotonergic effects.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

The aminotransferase abnormalities are usually mild, asymptomatic and transient, reversing even with continuation of medication. The rate of serum enzyme elevations specifically during protriptyline therapy has not been well defined. Rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury have been reported in patients on tricyclic antidepressants, but there have been no specific reports related to protriptyline. In typical tricyclic antidepressant acute liver injury, the latency to onset has ranged from 1 to 14 months. The pattern of serum enzyme elevations was typically cholestatic, but hepatocellular cases have also been reported including an acute hepatitis-like syndrome with acute liver failure. Instances of acute cholestatic hepatitis and prolonged jaundice compatible with vanishing bile duct syndrome have been linked to other tricyclic antidepressants, mostly amitriptyline and imipramine, the two most commonly used agents in this class. Signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (rash, fever and eosinophilia) are frequent in reported cases, but these symptoms are usually mild and transient. Autoantibody formation is rare. Protriptyline is a rarely used tricyclic antidepressant but is suspected of having a profile of adverse effects similar to that of imipramine and amitriptyline.",

Other more complicated side effects include; chest pain or heavy feeling, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, nausea, sweating, general ill feeling; sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden headache, confusion, problems with vision, speech, or balance; hallucinations, or seizure (convulsions); easy bruising or bleeding, unusual weakness; restless muscle movements in your eyes, tongue, jaw, or neck; urinating less than usual or not at all; extreme thirst with headache, nausea, vomiting, and weakness; or feeling light-headed or fainting. Deaths may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs. Multiple drug ingestion (including alcohol) is common in deliberate tricyclic antidepressant overdose. (Wikipedia)",

Patients may also chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless candy in order to increase the flow of saliva. Some artificial saliva products may give temporary relief. Men with prostate enlargement who take protriptyline may be especially likely to have problems with urinary retention. Symptoms include having difficulty starting a urine flow and more difficulty than usual passing urine. In most cases, urinary retention is managed with dose reduction or by switching to another type of antidepressant. In extreme cases, patients may require treatment with bethanechol, a drug that reverses this particular side effect. As management of overdose is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment. Signs and symptoms of toxicity develop rapidly after tricyclic antidepressant overdose, therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible. (Wikipedia)",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

For people who could become pregnant or who are currently pregnant, the FDA & EPA suggest eating up to 12 ounces (340 grams) of fish a week. This would equal 2 to 3 servings from their list of fish that fall under their \u201cBest Choices\u201d category, or 1 serving per week from the \u201cGood Choices\u201d category.There are different types (species) of tuna.

The baby\u2019s brain is the most sensitive organ to the effects of methylmercury exposure. The brain continues to develop throughout the entire pregnancy, so high exposure at any time in the pregnancy can be concerning.The effects of methylmercury on human pregnancy have been documented by several events that occurred many years ago in Japan and Iraq. Children were born with birth defects following the contamination of the food supply by methylmercury. These were extreme situations where a number of adults also became sick and died from the contamination. The birth defects reported were small head size, brain damage, developmental delay, intellectual disability, blindness, muscle weakness, and seizures.",

These high levels of exposures are not typical.

A study in another country, where people eat much more fish than is typically consumed in the U.S., reported that methylmercury from a balanced diet that includes fish is not likely to affect the development of the child from prenatal exposure. Another study found that children born to people who ate fish during pregnancy had higher IQ levels. This included persons who had somewhat increased levels of mercury; suggesting that other nutrients in fish might have had a protective effect.One study suggested that having exposure to higher levels of mercury in pregnancy might increase the chance of children maturing to puberty at a slightly younger age (called precocious puberty). This study has several limitations, so it is not proven that prenatal exposure to mercury was really the cause.",

You can maximize the benefits of fish by choosing fish with low mercury levels.People who are pregnant should not eat raw fish, such as that found in sushi and sashimi. This is because raw fish may contain bacteria or parasites that could cause serious illness. While cooking fish reduces the risk of illness from bacteria and pathogens, it does not reduce the levels of methylmercury in the fish.

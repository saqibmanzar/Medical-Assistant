When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In addition, this section contains information on appropriate engineering controls (e.g., use local exhaust ventilation, or use only in an enclosed system) as well as recommendations for personal protective measures to prevent illness or injury from exposure to chemicals, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., appropriate types of eye, face, skin or respiratory protection needed based on hazards and potential exposure).",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.2X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates trimethylbenzylammonium chloride will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase trimethylbenzylammonium chloride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 day. Particulate-phase trimethylbenzylammonium chloride will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, trimethylbenzylammonium chloride is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 900. By analogy to other alkyldimethylbenzyl quaternary ammonium compounds, trimethylbenzylammonium chloride is expected to strongly adsorb to sediment and suspended organic matter. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-14 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, trimethylbenzylammonium chloride is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Studies on the influence of chemical structure on quaternary ammonium compound (QACs) biodegradability suggest that alkyltrimethylammonium QACs will be most rapidly degraded followed by alkyldimethylbenzylammonium and alkylpyridinium QACs, although at high concentrations it may be toxic to the microbial population. A BCF of <0.2 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to trimethylbenzylammonium chloride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where trimethylbenzylammonium chloride is produced or used.

Volatilization of trimethylbenzylammonium chloride from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-14 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Trimethylbenzylammonium chloride is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 2.2X10-7 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5). Studies on the influence of chemical structure on quaternary ammonium compound (QACs) biodegradability suggest that alkyltrimethylammonium QACs will be most rapidly degraded followed by alkyldimethylbenzylammonium and alkylpyridinium QACs, although at high concentrations it may be toxic to the microbial population(6).",

By analogy to other alkyldimethylbenzyl quaternary ammonium compounds, trimethylbenzylammonium chloride is expected to strongly adsorb to sediment and suspended organic matter(8). Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-14 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Trimethylbenzylammonium chloride will not volatilize from water to the atmosphere(9,SRC) because it completely dissociates. According to a classification scheme(5), a BCF of <0.2(7), and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. If released to water, trimethylbenzylammonium chloride will completely dissociate(SRC) since it is an ionic compound. By analogy to other alkyldimethylbenzyl quaternary ammonium compounds, trimethylbenzylammonium chloride may biodegrade in aquatic systems at low concentrations(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that trimethylbenzylammonium chloride is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water surfaces(2). Trimethylbenzylammonium chloride's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces will not occur(SRC). Trimethylbenzylammonium chloride is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 2.2X10-7 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3).",

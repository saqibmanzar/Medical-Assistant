When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Improvement is manifested by relief of muscle spasm and its associated signs and symptoms, namely, pain, tenderness, limitation of motion, and restriction in activities of daily living. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride should be used only for short periods (up to two or three weeks) because adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use is not available and because muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions is generally of short duration and specific therapy for longer periods is seldom warranted. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride has not been found effective in the treatment of spasticity associated with cerebral or spinal cord disease, or in children with cerebral palsy. /Included in US product label/",

Currently there are no standardized drug therapies for the treatment of tinnitus. Based on the analogy between pain and tinnitus it is suggested that among all antidepressant families that have been used for tinnitus, particular interest should be paid to the tricyclic group of drugs as they have an analgesic effect. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a tricyclic pharmacological agent, namely cyclobenzaprine for the relief of tinnitus complaints. 65 patients, who received the drug treatment, were compared to 30 patients on a waiting list, who received no treatment. Analysis shows that cyclobenzaprine offers some benefit to patients with tinnitus on both tinnitus intensity and tinnitus distress, while a waiting list control group does not demonstrate any improvement: 24% of the tinnitus patients showed a clear response to cyclobenzaprine with a reduction of 53% on tinnitus intensity and 25% had a clear response to cyclobenzaprine with a reduction of 55% on tinnitus distress. It was further demonstrated that particular subgroups, namely pure tone tinnitus patients and unilateral tinnitus patients, respond better to cyclobenzaprine. Our results indicate that cyclobenzaprine is a promising drug to treat tinnitus particularly in certain subgroups. As there is a good risk-benefit ratio and there are currently no well-established, specific treatments for tinnitus, cyclobenzaprine might be worthwhile to further investigate.",

The concomitant use of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride with MAO inhibitors is contraindicated. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., confusion, agitation, hallucinations), autonomic instability (e.g., diaphoresis, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., tremor, ataxia, hyperreflexia, clonus, muscle rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Treatment with Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above reactions occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. If concomitant treatment with Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, careful observation is advised, particularly during treatment initiation or dose increases.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The drug was rapidly and widely distributed into rat tissues, highest concentrations being found in the small intestine, lung, kidney, and liver. The drug was highly bound in human plasma. Extensive biliary excretion of the labeled compound was observed in the rat.

Seventy-five percent of this drug at a concentration of 1 mM was metabolized within 72 hr by C. elegans grown on Sabouraud dextrose broth. Milligram amounts of fungal metabolites were isolated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and their structures were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and UV spectroscopy analyses. The major fungal metabolites of cyclobenzaprine were 2-hydroxycyclobenzaprine (59%), N-desmethylcyclobenzaprine (21%), cyclobenzaprine trans-10,11-dihydrodiol (5%), N-desmethyl-2-hydroxy-cyclobenzaprine (3%), 3-hydroxycyclobenzaprine (3%), and cyclobenzaprine N-oxide (1%). These fungal metabolites were used as standards to investigate the metabolism of cyclobenzaprine by rat liver microsomes. Rat liver microsomes also biotransformed cyclobenzaprine to produce similar metabolites as the fungus. The isotope labeling of 2-hydroxycyclobenzaprine by 18O2 and the trans-configuration of the dihydrodiol suggested that these reactions were catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases in C. elegans. These results also demonstrated that the fungal biotransformation system could be used to predict and synthesize the mammalian drug metabolites.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

There is some evidence that cyclobenzaprine exerts its effects at the supraspinal level, specifically within the locus coeruleus of the brainstem, with little-to-no action at neuromuscular junctions or directly on skeletal musculature. Action on the brainstem is thought to result in diminished activity of efferent alpha and gamma motor neurons, likely mediated by inhibition of coeruleus-spinal or reticulospinal pathways, and ultimately depressed spinal cord interneuron activity.  More recently it has been suggested that inhibition of descending serotonergic pathways in the spinal cord via action on 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to cyclobenzaprine\u2019s observed effects.",

In the present study, we examined the effects of cyclobenzaprine on descending neurons by measuring the monosynaptic reflex in rats. Cyclobenzaprine reduced the monosynaptic reflex amplitude dose dependently and this effect was not inhibited by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists idazoxan and yohimbine. Cyclobenzaprine-induced monosynaptic reflex depression was not attenuated by noradrenergic neuronal lesions produced by 6-hydroxydopamine. However, cyclobenzaprine inhibited monosynaptic reflex facilitation induced by (+/-)-1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane, a 5-HT2 receptor agonist, in spinalized rats markedly, and 5-HT depletion by DL-p-chlorophenylalanine inhibited the depressive effect of cyclobenzaprine on the monosynaptic reflex. These results suggest that cyclobenzaprine is a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist and that its muscle relaxant effect is due to inhibition of serotonergic, not noradrenergic, descending systems in the spinal cord.",

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Manifestations of toxicity may develop rapidly after a cyclobenzaprine overdose, and rarely, death may occur. The most common toxic effects associated with cyclobenzaprine overdose are drowsiness and tachycardia; less frequent manifestations include tremor, agitation, coma, ataxia, hypertension, slurred speech, confusion, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and hallucinations. Rarely, potentially serious effects may include cardiac arrest, chest pain, cardiac dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, seizures, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is another potential side effect. Blood concentration of > or = 0.8 mg/L cyclobenzaprine may be associated with a fatal outcome. In one case of accidental overdose, the victim developed severe hypothermia and then developed cardiac arrest during transport. ANIMAL STUDIES: Ptyalism, emesis, tremors, convulsions and increased respiratory rate developed and death occurred within 1 hour following single oral doses of 180 mg/kg or more by gavage in dogs. Acute exposure to the drug in rats resulted in ataxia, decreased respiratory rate, sedation, flaccid hind legs, loss of the ear flick reflex, loss of the righting reflex with swimming movements, intermittent clonic convulsions, weight loss, lethargy, and then death. The drug was more toxic to infant and weanling rats than to young adults. In rats treated with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride for up to 67 weeks at doses of approximately 5 to 40 times the maximum recommended human dose, pale, sometimes enlarged, livers were noted and there was a dose-related hepatocyte vacuolation with lipidosis. No evidence of embryo lethality or teratogenicity was revealed following oral doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg/day in studies in mice and rabbits. The reproductive performance and fertility of males and females, and the growth and survival of their offspring were not adversely affected by doses of 5 or 10 mg/kg/day in rats. Litter size, size and survival of the pups, and weight gain of the mothers were decreased by doses of 20 mg/kg/day. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride was determined to have no genotoxic effects in several assays, including mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay; Salmonella-Escherichia coli mammalian microsome reverse mutation assay with confirmatory assay; and in a CHO cells chromosomal aberration assay with and without metabolic activation.",

Case 1: a 56-year-old female was found in full cardiopulmonary arrest after a verbal suicide threat to a friend. Postmortem blood concentrations were cyclobenzaprine 0.96 mg/L and diazepam 0.3 mg/L. Case 2: a 37-year-old male was found in full arrest by a family member after an intentional ingestion of cyclobenzaprine. Postmortem blood concentrations were cyclobenzaprine 0.8 mg/L and ethanol 0.174 gm/dL. The concentrations of diazepam and ethanol reported in these two patients were not found in quantities usually associated with a fatal outcome, suggesting that the cyclobenzaprine was the primary cause of the fatality. Additionally, the blood was drawn from a femoral site, so that postmortem redistribution is not a likely factor. Blood concentration of > or = 0.8 mg/L cyclobenzaprine may be associated with a fatal outcome.",

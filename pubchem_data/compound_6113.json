ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

To determine the importance in germ-line mutagenesis of the O6-G site relative to the N-7 of guanine, dose-response curves were constructed for both 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea and ethyl methanesulfonate, where dose was measured as total adducts per deoxynucleotide and response as sex-linked recessive lethals induced in Drosophila melanogaster spermatozoa. For both mutagens the dose response curve was linear and extrapolated to the origin. ... 1-Ethyl-1-nitrosourea is 1.9 times more efficient per adduct in inducing sex-linked recessive lethals mutations than EMS. In vitro studies showed that 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea induced 9.5% of its total adducts on O6-G while EMS induced 2.0% of its adducts on O6-G. If O6-G was the sole genotoxic site, then 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea should be 4.8 times more efficient per adduct than ethyl methanesulfonate. ...

In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a protective suit and a carefully fitted respiratory. If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. Smoking, eating, and drinking should be prohibited in ethyl methanesulfonate work areas. Ethyl methanesulfonate should be stored in a securely sealed container which is enclosed in a second, unbreakable, leakproof container. Ethyl methanesulfonate is a potential candidate for fluidized bed, rotary kiln, and liquid injection forms of incineration.",

In the presence of vitamin C at a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml, ethyl methanesulfonate induced mutations were reduced to about one-third or one-forth of those in control cultures treated with ethyl methanesulfonate alone. Dehydro-vitamin C and iso-vitamin C also inhibited ethyl methanesulfonate induced mutations to about ... one-half or one-third of the control level. ... Vitamin C may react directly with ethyl methanesulfonate as a desmutagen and thus inactivate its mutation-inducing activity in Chinese hamster V79 cells. Vitamin E had an additive cytotoxic effect on EMS-induced cytotoxicity. This vitamin enhanced the frequencies of 6TG-resistant mutations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate. Pretreatment with vitamin E before treatment with ethyl methanesulfonate resulted in no detectable effect in modifying the ethyl methanesulfonate induced mutations. On the contrary, vitamin A markedly enhanced ethyl methanesulfonate induced mutation frequencies.",

A reduction of the mutation rate induced by ethyl methanesulfate in adults could be observed independently of the developmental stages (larvae or imago) pretreated with 1,4-dihydropyridine. The protective effect of this ... antimutagen against the alkylating agent depended on both the 1,4-dihydropyridine dose and the level of the ethyl methanesulfonate induced mutation rate. The effect of 1,4-dihydropyridine was more pronounced than that of /cysteine and cysteamine/.",

The exogenous administration of alpha-TS (25 microM) completely protected hepatocytes from chemically- induced toxicity when exposed to physiological free extracellular calcium concentrations (0.8-1.5 mM). ... Hepatocytes exposed to unesterified alpha- tocopherol (alpha-T, 25 microM) or alpha-tocopheryl acetate (alpha-TA, 25 microM), however, were not protected from the toxic effect of chemicals even though these treatments resulted in the marked accumulation of cellular alpha-T (2.65 nml/10(6) cells) and alpha-TA (2.3 nmol/10(6) cells), respectively. Finding suggest that the supplementation of endogenous stores of alpha-T or alpha-TA does not promote protection against chemical toxicity and that alpha-TS cytoprotection results not from the accumulation of alpha-T but rather from the cellular presence of the intact alpha-TS molecule. Thus alpha-TS appears to possess cytoprotective properties that differ from other vitamin E congeners.",

The relationship between sister chromatid exchange and toxicity was quantified, the progression through the cell cycle was evaluated with flow cytometric methods, and the effects of these chemicals on cell growth and average generation time were determined. A strong correlation existed between relative cloning efficiency and sister chromatid exchange (r= -0.978, p< .001) which was accompanied by an inhibition of growth as evidenced by a significant (p< .0001) negative linear effect of concentration on the relative cell count from 24 to 72 hr after exposure and by a concentration dependent increase (p< .0001) in the average generation time. Delays in the transit through S-phase were evident 4 hr after exposure to toxic concentrations of either carcinogen and by 8 to 12 hr post-exposure at the lower concentrations. Increases in the percentage of nuclei in G2 + M, indicative of G2 arrest, occurred from 12 to 24 hr after exposure. ...",

Observations were made for 14 days. EMS progressively decreased the fresh weight of Anabaena oryzae (except on 2nd day at 15 min time dose) over controls. Chlorophyll a decreased in all the days with increase in dose time. In Nostoc entophytum, growth rates in EMS treated cultures were significantly affected but the cells grew after a long lag-phase (as compared to controls). Chlorophyll a was consistently reduced (except on 4th and 6th day at 15 min time dose) over controls. Vegetative cell length and breadth for both algae were higher in treated cultures. Algae treated with 0.1 mL of EMS at pH 5 for 2 hr, grew after a much shorter lag phase than those treated at higher pH values (pH 6, 7, or 8). Breakage of filaments and cell lysis were observed in Anabaena oryzae at 30 and 60 min doses. Nostoc entophytum was even more strongly affected. The cells showed chlorosis and lysis with incr time doses. The filaments in control were greenish blue whereas in treated samples they were pale yellow.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.206 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl methanesulfonate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl methanesulfonate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 days. Ethyl methanesulfonate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethyl methanesulfonate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 22. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyl methanesulfonate is expected to hydrolyze in the presence of water with reported half-lives of 46 and 96 hours and this is expected to be the major fate process for this compound in water and moist soil environments. Ethyl methanesulfonate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, ethyl methanesulfonate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. While volatilization from water surfaces may occur based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant, hydrolysis of ethyl methanesulfonate is expected to be the major fate process for this compound in water. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 60 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since ethyl methansulfonate is no longer produced or used in the US. In the past, ethyl methanesulfonate was used as a research chemical and it is expected that inhalation and dermal exposure to this compound would be minimized under these circumstances. (SRC)",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 17 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). A neutral hydrolysis rate constant of 1.58X10-2 per hour was measured for ethyl methanesulfonate; this corresponds to a half-life of 46 hours at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C(2). In a second study, a reaction rate constant of 7.2X10-3 per hour was measured(3); this corresponds to a half-life of 96 hours at 20 \u00b0C(3). This compound is expected to be inert to reaction with naturally-occurring oxidants found in water (alkylperoxy radicals and singlet oxygen)(4). Ethyl methanesulfonate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

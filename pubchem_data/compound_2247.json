When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Human P450s involved in the O-demethylation of astemizole have, however, not been identified, and the involvement of twelve known drug-metabolizing P450s were denied. During the course of the P450 identification study, higher activities of the astemizole O-demethylation in the rabbit small intestine than in the liver (about 3-fold) were found. These data suggest the possible involvement of CYP2J, since P450 included in this subfamily is dominantly expressed in the small intestine of rabbits. ...",

Experiments with recombinant P450s and antibodies indicate a negligible role for CYP3A4 on the main metabolic route of astemizole, i.e. formation of DES-AST, although CYP3A4 may mediate the relatively minor metabolic routes to 6OH-AST and NOR-AST. Recombinant CYP2D6 catalyzed the formation of 6OH-AST and DES-AST. Studies with human liver microsomes, however, suggest a major role for a mono P450 in DES-AST formation. ...",

Information about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these medications, while still incomplete, is now sufficient to permit optimisation of therapy. Published pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information on these H1-RA is summarised here, and areas where more data are required are delineated. Serum concentrations of most second-generation H1-RA are relatively low, and are usually measured by radioimmunoassay. After oral administration, peak concentrations are observed within 2 or 3 h. Bioavailability has not been well studied, due to the lack of intravenous formulations. Most H1-RA are metabolised in the hepatic cytochrome P450 system: terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, azelastine, and ebastine have 1 or more active metabolites which are present in serum in higher concentrations than the respective parent compound, and therefore can be measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Cetirizine, an active metabolite of the first generation H1-receptor antagonist hydroxyzine, is not further metabolised to any great extent in vivo, and is eliminated via renal excretion. Levocabastine is also eliminated primarily by excretion. Serum elimination half-life values differ greatly from 1 H1-RA to another, and are 24 h or less for terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, cetirizine, azelastine and ebastine, and the active metabolites of terfenadine, loratadine and ebastine. The active metabolite of azelastine (demethylazelastine) has a serum elimination half-life value of about 2 days, while that of astemizole (demethyl-astemizole) has a value of 9.5 days. From the few published studies in which the apparent volumes of distribution of the second-generation H1-RA have been calculated, it appears that tissue distribution is extensive. In children, the half-lives of H1-RA are generally shorter than are found in adults; there is no published information on the pharmacokinetics of astemizole, loratadine, azelastine, or ebastine in children. In some elderly adults, terfenadine, loratadine and cetirizine may have longer half-lives than in young healthy adults. There is little published data on the pharmacokinetics of the second-generation H1-RA in patients with impaired hepatic function. The half-life of cetirizine is prolonged in those with impaired renal function. There is a paucity of information on the pharmacokinetics of H1-RA in neonates, in pregnancy or during lactation.",

All of the metabolites of astemizole tested were more active than the parent compound in inhibiting contraction of the ileum and bronchoconstriction induced by histamine in guinea pigs. Desmethylastemizole was about the same as astemizole in inhibiting mepyramine binding in guinea pig cerebellum. In heterologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and homologous PCA, the metabolites caused almost equipotent inhibition to that seen with astemizole. No H2-antagonistic activity was seen with astemizole or desmethylastemizole.",

They may also have a therapeutic role to play in asthma. Until recently all antihistamines produced some degree of drowsiness, as well as having anticholinergic side effects. Several non-sedating antihistamines have now been developed. Evidence suggests that their freedom from central nervous system effects is due to their lack of penetration of the blood brain barrier. They also have no appreciable binding to cholinergic receptors. Two of these non-sedating antihistamines, terfenadine and astemizole, have novel binding characteristics with the histamine H1 receptor, exhibiting irreversible binding at higher concentrations. In humans astemizole has a remarkably long half-life of elimination, on the order of 12 to 18 days for metabolites. Clinical trials have demonstrated that these newer antihistamines are as effective as classical antihistamines and that they have no greater incidence of central nervous system or anticholinergic side effects than placebo.",

The perforated patch clamp recording technique was used to study the effects of desmethylastemizole (20 nmol/liter) on action potentials and iKr in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes. Desmethylastemizole produced action potential prolongation and the induction of plateau early afterdepolarizations. Under voltage clamp conditions, desmethylastemizole suppressed iKr amplitude by approximately 65%. The drug E-4031 (100 nmol/liter), which selectively blocks iKr, had a similar effect on current amplitude. Desmethylastemizole, the major astemizole metabolite, blocks the repolarizing K+ current iKr with high affinity. The clinical observation of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes found with astemizole intake may principally be caused by the proarrhythmic effects of its metabolite desmethylastemizole.",

The study was conducted in a two-way cross-over fashion after the subjects had been randomly given either dirithromycin (two 250 mg tablets) or placebo (two tablets) every morning for 10 days. On the morning of the fourth dose of either dirithromycin or placebo each subject ingested a single 30-mg oral dose (three 10-mg tablets) of astemizole. The disposition kinetics of both astemizole and its major metabolite, N-desmethylastemizole, were characterized after measuring the concentrations of both analytes in the serum fraction of serial blood samples collected for 14 days after the astemizole dose. In addition, corrected QTc intervals were estimated from electrocardiogram rhythm strips that were run 24 hours prior to the astemizole dose, 12 hours after the astemizole dose, and after the last treatment (dirithromycin or placebo) dose in both study periods. Pharmacokinetic parameters that were measured for both astemizole and N-desmethylastemizole during each treatment were: C(max), t(max), AUC (0-infinity), CL(oral), half-life, and volume of distribution (V). None of the parameters for N-desmethylastemizole was different when comparing data by ANOVA from the dirithromycin treatment period with that of the placebo treatment period. On the other hand, during dirithromycin treatment astemizole Cl(oral) was 34% slower, volume of distribution was 24% larger, and half-life was 84% longer. Generally, all QTc intervals did not appear to be affected by dirithromycin treatment. The changes in astemizole kinetics could not be attributed to its N-demethylation since the dispositional kinetics of N-desmethylastemizole were unaffected by dirithromycin. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain the clinical significance of the changes in astemizole kinetics. Since there were no significant differences for mean QTc intervals and no effect of dirithromycin treatment on N-desmethylastemizole kinetics, it is unlikely that a standard regimen of dirithromycin would place a patient taking astemizole at an increased risk of torsade de pointes or related ventricular arrhythmias.",

Chemical inhibitors of astemizole O-demethylation were screened using the small intestinal and liver microsomes from rabbit as an animal model for the first-pass metabolism of humans. In the rabbit small intestine, astemizole O-demethylation was clearly inhibited by ebastine, arachidonic acid, alpha-naphthoflavone, ketoconazole, tranylcypromine, troglitazone and terfenadine. In humans, these inhibitors also reduced microsomal astemizole O-demethylation in both the small intestine and liver. However, the inhibition rate of almost all these chemicals were clearly greater in the small intestine than in the liver. Thus, a different contribution of cytochrome p450 in each tissue is suggested. All the chemicals inhibited astemizole O-demethylation in recombinant CYP2J2 microsomes. The results suggest that CYP2J2 is involved in astemizole O-demethylation in both the human small intestine and liver; however, the contribution in the liver is lower than in the small intestine. The effects of the CYP2J2 inhibitors during first-pass metabolism may be more important in the small intestine than in the liver. Since all the inhibition profiles of astemizole O-demethylation were different in the liver and small intestine, involvement of another p450 in astemizole O-demethylation in human liver may be speculated. In the rabbit microsomal systems, the same metabolites found in humans were qualitatively detected and the inhibition profiles of the chemical agents in the microsomes resembled that of humans.",

The following antiepileptic drugs were administered intraperitoneally: valproate magnesium, carbamazepine, diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital. Adverse effects were evaluated in the chimney test (motor performance) and passive avoidance task (long-term memory). Brain and plasma levels of antiepileptic drugs were measured by immunofluorescence. Astemizole (a single dose and following a 7-day treatment at 2-6 mg/kg) reduced the threshold for electroconvulsions, being without effect upon this parameter at lower doses. Astemizole (1 mg/kg) did not significantly alter the protective effect of antiepileptic drugs against maximal electroshock (after acute and 7-day administration). Also, acute astemizole (2 mg/kg) remained ineffective in this respect. Astemizole (2 mg/kg), following chronic administration, significantly reduced the protective efficacy of phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin, reflected by an increase in their ED(50) values (50% effective dose necessary to protect 50% of animals tested against maximal electroshock) from 21.1 to 34.0 mg/kg and from 10.4 to 19.2 mg/kg, respectively. Astemizole (2 mg/kg) did not alter the protective activity of the remaining antiepileptic drugs. Moreover, astemizole (2 mg/kg) did not influence the free plasma levels and brain concentration of the studied antiepileptic drugs. Also, this H(1) receptor antagonist did not impair long-term memory or motor coordination when given acutely. However, 7-day treatment with astemizole (2 mg/kg) significantly decreased TD(50) (50% toxic dose required to induce motor impairment in 50% of animals) value of phenobarbital, being without effect on carbamazepine, valproate and diphenylhydantoin in this respect. Similarly, phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin, administered alone at their ED(50)s against maximal electroshock, or combined with astemizole, disturbed long-term memory in mice. The results of this study indicate that astemizole may need to be used with caution in epileptic patients.",

Treat coma, hyperthermia, and atypical ventricular tachycardia if they occur. Monitor the patient for at least 6 to 8 hours after ingestion.There is no specific antidote for antihistamine overdose. As for anticholinergic poisoning, physostigmine has been used for treatment of severe delirium or tachycardia. However because antihistamine overdose carry a greater risk for seizures physostigmine is not recommended routinely. Sodium bicarbonate may be useful for myocardial depression and QRS interval prolongation after massive diphenhydramine overdose. Administer activated charcoal orally if conditions are appropriate. Gastric lavage is not necessary after small to moderate ingestions if activated charcoal can be given promptly. Because of slowed gastrointestinal motility, gut decontamination procedures may be helpful even in late-presenting patients. Hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, peritoneal dialysis, and repeat dose activated charcoal are not effective in removing antihistamines.",

The doses given--approximately 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg body weight/day were equivalent to 25, 100, and 400 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 10 mg/day. Survival of both mice and rats was comparable between groups. Peto's age-adjusted, dose-related trend analysis for the tumor-bearing rats did not reveal a statistically significant difference for males or females. There was no evidence that astemizole led to an increased incidence of spontaneously or unusually occurring neoplastic lesions in either mice or rats. Special attention was given to the effect of astemizole on the progression of spontaneously occurring mammary gland adenomas and fibroadenomas. Peto's analysis applied to the number of female rats bearing these benign mammary gland tumors disclosed no statistically significant dose-related trend. There was no positive trend for the onset of this tumor type, and the median size of the tumor over time per rat was also not statistically significantly different in a comparison of the control group with each of the dosed groups. The findings from these carcinogenicity studies suggest that astemizole is not tumorigenic and that it does not promote tumor growth.",

Astemizole (10 mg/kg) was injected daily into female Wistar rats throughout pregnancy (prenatal treatment) or during the first 6 days of lactation (postnatal treatment). Neither treatment modified dam body weight. Prenatal exposure reduced offspring body weight and lead to a latter expression of the vaginal opening of female offspring. In addition, a long-term disruption of male reproductive behavior was observed, while female sexual behavior was not modified. The sexual activity index and the intromission frequency were increased in prenatally treated animals. Testes wet weight was reduced, but no modifications were detected in vas deferens or seminal vesicles. Postnatal treatment did not alter offspring body weight, open-field activity, sexual behavior and organ weight /and/ did not delay testes descent but reduced the time until vaginal opening. Hypothalamic serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline as well as dopamine and noradrenaline metabolites were not modified by both prenatal and postnatal treatments. Increased striatal 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels were observed after prenatal and postnatal treatments, while only postnatal serotonin levels were increased. The present results indicate that prenatal astemizole exposure can have long-lasting organizational effects on reproductive behavior of male rats, while postnatal exposure to this drug did not alter mating behavior. In relation to female rats, prenatal and postnatal exposures to astemizole accelerated puberty but did not alter sexual behavior. Neurochemical data show that both treatments increased striatal dopaminergic system activity, suggesting a central astemizole effect after perinatal exposure.",

A dose of 0.3 mg/kg of iv astemizole (n = 7), which is close to the recommended dose for clinical use, showed a bradycardic effect and a reversed use-dependent lengthening of repolarization. The increase in the repolarization was greater than in the effective refractory period. These effects persisted even when the plasma drug concentration became undetectable. Additional administration of 3.0 mg/kg of iv astemizole (n = 7) decreased the mean blood pressure, suppressed the cardiac contraction and conduction, and induced early after depolarization-like potential in addition to the qualitatively similar effects compared to those observed by the lower dose. The decrease of the plasma concentration of astemizole followed the pattern predicted by the two-compartment theory of pharmacokinetics, but the drug concentration in the cardiac muscle was estimated to be more than 100 times greater than that in plasma. /The/ study emphasizes that each cardiac consequence of astemizole overdose may be related to proarrhythmic effects and the monitoring of plasma drug concentration will be less helpful in predicting the cardiac adverse effects of astemizole.",

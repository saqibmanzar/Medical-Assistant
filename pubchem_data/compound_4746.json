When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Perhexiline increases glucose metabolism at the expense of free-fatty-acid metabolism, enhancing oxygen efficiency during myocardial ischaemia.

The predominant mechanism of this particular perhexiline effect is an increase in platelet cGMP responsiveness. Perhexiline also may reduce the potential for nitric oxide clearance by neutrophil-derived oxygen. Perhexiline relieves symptoms of angina, improves exercise tolerance, and increases the workload needed to induce ischaemia when used as monotherapy. The primary therapeutic roles for perhexiline are as short-term therapy (less than 3 months duration) in patients with severe ischaemia awaiting coronary revascularisation or long-term therapy in patients with ischaemic symptoms refractory to other therapeutic measures.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Because of its low molecular weight and hydrophobic nature, dermal absorption is also likely ... . In rats treated with 1,1-DCE by gavage in corn oil, complete gastrointestinal absorption was found to occur at <350 mg/kg. 1,1-DCE is easily transported across the alveolar membrane. ... The major route of excretion for unchanged 1,1-DCE is through the lung. However, the majority of 1,1-DCE is rapidly metabolized to nonvolatile compounds and covalently bound derivatives. Mice metabolize more 1,1-DCE than do rats. For example, when given 50 mg/kg by oral gavage in corn oil, mice excreted 6% and rats excreted 28% of the dose as unchanged 1,1-DCE through the lungs. When exposed to 10 ppm for a single 6-hour episode, mice excreted 0.65% and rats excreted 1.63% of the absorbed dose as unchanged 1,1-DCE through the lungs. Intraperitoneal administration of 125 mg/kg (14)C-1,1-DCE to mice resulted in the highest concentrations of covalent binding (based on protein content) in the kidney, lung, and liver. The covalent binding and cellular damage in kidney, lung, and liver correlated with the high concentration of CYP2E1 in certain cell populations in these tissues.",

Fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats that inhaled 100 or 300 ppm for 2 hr absorbed total systemic doses of (10 or 30 mg/kg DCE, respectively. Other groups of rats received 10 or 30 mg/kg DCE by intravenous injection, bolus gavage (by mouth), or gastric infusion (g.i.) over a 2-hr period. Serial microblood samples were taken from the cannulated, unanesthetized animals and analyzed for DCE content by gas chromatography to obtain concentration versus time profiles. Inhalation resulted in substantially higher peak blood concentrations and area under blood-concentration time curves (AUC(0)(2)) than did gastric infusion of the same dose over the same time frame at each dosage level, although inhalation (AUC(0)(infinity)) values were only modestly higher. Urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) activities were monitored as indices of kidney injury in the high-dose groups. NAG and GGT excretion were much more pronounced after inhalation than gastric infusion. Administration of DCE by gavage also produced much higher Cmax and AUC(0)(2) values than did 2-hr g.i., although AUC(0)(infinity) values were not very different. The 30 mg/kg bolus dose produced marked elevation in serum sorbitol dehydrogenase, an index of hepatocellular injury. Administration of this dose by inhalation and gastric infusion was only marginally hepatotoxic. These findings demonstrate the TK and target organ toxicity of DCE vary substantially between different exposure routes, as well as dosage regimens, making direct extrapolations untenable in health risk assessments.",

With the 1 mg/kg body wt oral dose & the 10 ppm inhalation dose, there was no difference in elimination by fed versus fasted rats.

Vinylidene chloride (VDC) is nephrotoxic in mice after inhalation, but not after oral or intraperitoneal administration. The nephrotoxicity of VDC is due to the selective expression of an androgen-dependent cytochrome P450 in the proximal tubules of male mice. This enzyme oxidizes VDC to an electrophile and is not present in female mice, but can be induced be androgen treatment. The observation of nephrotoxicity of VDC after inhalation only is due to the high blood flow to the kidney and thus high concentrations of VDC delivered to the kidney after inhalation. After oral or intraperitoneal application, hepatic first-pass metabolism efficiently reduces the amount of VDC delivered to the kidney...",

It is not known whether the metabolism of 1,1-DCE is the same in humans, although in vitro microsomal preparations from human liver and lung form the same initial products ... . Oxidation of 1,1-DCE by CYP2E1 should produce three metabolites: DCE epoxide, 2-chloroacetyl chloride, and 2,2-dichloroacetaldehyde. All of these metabolites react with glutathione (GSH) and/or water. In the kidney, further metabolism of S-(2,2-dichloro-1- hydroxy)ethylglutathione could form another toxic compound, dicholorothioketene. The GSH conjugates formed are catabolized in the kidney to a variety of urinary excretion products. The epoxide, and perhaps to a lesser extent the chloroacetaldehyde, are believed to be associated with the tissue reactivity and toxic effects in tissues that ensue after significant depletion of GSH. The primary metabolites of 1,1-DCE formed in rat hepatic microsomal incubations are DCE epoxide, 2,2-dichloroacetaldehyde, and 2-chloroacetyl chloride ... . These metabolites were also identified from mouse microsomal incubations ... . All these electrophilic metabolites undergo secondary reactions, including oxidation, conjugation with GSH, and hydrolysis. The major products formed are GSH conjugates, 2-(S-glutathionyl)acetyl glutathione, and 2-S-glutathionyl acetate, which are believed to be derived from the DCE epoxide. S-(2,2-Dichloro-1-hydroxy ethyl glutathione, the GSH conjugate formed from reaction of GSH with 2,2- dichloroacetaldehyde, was not observed in rat liver microsomal incubations containing GSH ... . The acetal, together with chloroacetic acid and S-(2-chloroacetyl)- glutathione - the hydrolysis and GSH-conjugated products of 2-chloroacetyl chloride, respectively - was detected at levels much lower than those for the DCE epoxide-derived conjugates.",

Liver microsomes from three out of five human samples metabolized 1,1-DCE to the epoxide-derived GSH conjugates at levels that were 2.5- to 3-fold higher than in mouse liver microsomes, based on milligrams of microsomal protein. These GSH conjugates were also the major products formed in lung microsomes from eight human samples; only low levels of 2,2-dichloroacetaldehyde were formed. The mean level in lung microsomes from humans was about 50% of the amount formed in lung microsomes from mice. In both animal and human tissues, cytochrome P450 CYP2E1 catalyzes the formation of the DCE epoxide.",

Liquid-phase dehydrochlorination in the presence of alkali, e.g., NaOH /and/ 2. Pyrolytic gas-phase cracking at elevated temperatures. ... The latter route has the advantage that valuable chlorine is recovered as hydrogen chloride, which can be used again for oxychlorination processes. By this route, however, vinylidene chloride selectivity is low, because the formation of 1,2-dichloroethylenes is favored.  In the liquid phase reaction, vinylidene chloride selectivity is well above 90%; however, hydrogen chloride is lost as a salt.",

Low-level, chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure of vinylidene chloride in humans may effect the liver. Animal studies indicate that chronic exposure to vinylidene chloride can affect the liver, kidneys, CNS and lungs.

May form peroxides in storage. High concentrations cause a deficiency of oxygen with the risk of unconsciousness or death. Check that oxygen content is at least 19% before entering storage or spill area. A regulated, marked area should be established where this chemical is handled, used, or stored in compliance with OSHA Standard 1910.1045. ... Prior to working with this chemical you should be trained on its proper handling and storage. Before entering confined space where this chemical may be present, check to make sure that an explosive concentration is not present. Vinylidene chloride must be stored to avoid contact with oxidizers, such as perchlorates, peroxides, permanganates, chlorates, and nitrates, and strong acids, such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, and nitric, since violent reactions occur. Store in tightly closed containers in a cool, well-ventilated area away from sources of heat. Protect storage containers from physical damage. Sources of ignition, such as smoking and open flames, are prohibited where vinylidene chloride is handled, used, stored. Metal containers involving the transfer of 5 gallons or more of vinylidene chloride should be grounded and bonded. Drums must be equipped with self-closing valves, pressure vacuum bungs, and flame arresters. Use only nonsparking tools and equipment, especially when opening and closing containers of vinylidene chloride. Wherever vinylidene chloride is used, handled, manufactured, or stored, use explosion-proof electrical equipment and fittings. Procedures for handling, use, and storage of cylinders should be in compliance with OSHA 1910.101 and 1910.169, as with the recommendations of the Compressed Gas Association.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Four tank cars were damaged, spilling approx 300,000 lb of vinylidene chloride, 330,000 lb of phenol, and 125,000 lb of ethylene oxide. Most of the phenol, which had solidified on the surface, was removed by a cleanup contractor although residual phenol remained in the soil. The ethylene oxide vaporized, posing no groundwater contamination problems. The vinylidene chloride percolated through the sandy soils into the groundwater about 50 ft below the ground surface. Vinylidene chloride concentrations as high as 300 mg/L were found in monitoring wells near the derailment site. The groundwater cleanup program was completed over a three yr period. ...",

It is used as a captive intermediate in the production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b), in the production of chloroacetyl chloride, and in the production of homo-, co-, and terpolymers (latex and resin). The polymers are used in a variety of consumer products, including food packaging, textiles, and outdoor furniture. HUMAN STUDIES: Potential symptoms of overexposure are irritation of eyes, skin, throat, dizziness, headache, nausea, dyspnea, liver and kidney dysfunction, pneumonitis. Acute exposure to high concentrations of 1,1-DCE in air results in CNS depression. Repeated exposures to low concentrations are associated with liver and renal dysfunction. Contact with the eye causes conjunctivitis and transient corneal injury. Skin contact with 1,1-DCE causes irritation, which may be due partly to the presence of an inhibitor, hydroquinone monomethyl ether. In one epidemiological study of 138 workers exposed to 1,1-DCE in the United States, no excess of cancer was found, but follow-up was incomplete, and nearly 40% of the workers had less than 15 years' latency since first exposure. In a study in the Federal Republic of Germany of 629 workers exposed to 1,1-DCE, seven deaths from cancer (five bronchial carcinomas) were reported. This number was not in excess of the expected value. Two cases of bronchial carcinoma were found in workers, both of whom were 37 years old, whereas 0.07 were expected for persons aged 35 to 39 years. Three reports suggest an association between exposure to dichloroethylenes and birth defects. However, all of these situations involved exposure to multiple contaminants, so a cause-and-effect relationship between the reported birth defects and exposure to 1,1-DCE cannot be established. Hepatotoxicity has been observed in humans after repeated exposure to 1,1-DCE, presumably by the inhalation route. ANIMAL STUDIES: One study shows no evidence that 1,1-DCE causes skin sensitization. Following high-dose exposure by the oral or inhalation route, the target organs in experimental animals are the liver, the kidney, and the Clara cells of the lung. Following low-dose, long-term exposure, the liver is the major target organ in rats following oral or inhalation exposure, but the kidney is the major target organ in mice following inhalation exposure. Bioassays for cancer by the oral route of exposure have been conducted in rats, mice, and trout. Although these bioassays have protocol limitations, none provides any significant evidence that 1,1-DCE is a carcinogen by the oral route of exposure. Bioassays for cancer by the inhalation route of exposure have been conducted in rats, mice, and hamsters. One bioassay in male mice showed an increase in the incidence of kidney adenocarcinomas at one exposure level. There is evidence that the induction of kidney adenocarcinomas is a sex- and species-specific response related to the expression of CYP2E1 in the kidney of male mice. 1,1-DCE causes gene mutations in microorganisms in the presence of metabolic activation. Most tests with mammalian cells in vitro or in vivo show no evidence of genotoxicity. No reproductive or developmental toxicity was observed at an oral exposure that caused minimal toxicity in the liver of the dams. An increased incidence of total cardiac malformations of 12-13% was recorded in pups from rats imbibing water containing either 0.15 ppm or 110 ppm 1,1-DCE over a period of 2 months prior to and subsequently the whole pregnancy period (controls had a 3% incidence of similar cardiac anomalie). An increased incidence of cardiac terata was also reported when utilizing method of continuous infusion of the chemical directly into the gravid rat uterus via implanted osmotic pumps. 1,1-DCE was a cardiac teratogen in the chick embryo, cardiac anomalies included atrial and ventricular septal defects, malformations of all valves, and great vessel abnormalities. There is evidence of fetal toxicity (delayed ossification) following inhalation exposure in the absence of maternal toxicity. The toxicity of 1,1-DCE is associated with cytochrome P450-catalyzed metabolism of 1,1-DCE to reactive intermediates that bind covalently to cellular macromolecules. The extent of binding is inversely related to loss of GSH, so that severity of tissue damage parallel the decline in GSH. Thus, the responses to 1,1-DCE at low doses with little depletion of GSH are expected to be very different from the responses at high doses causing substantial GSH depletion. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: An 18-month carcinogenicity study of 1,1-DCE in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (8 weeks old) at 4 mg/kg body weight per day was conducted. 1,1-DCE was incorporated in the feed. Tissues examined for neoplasms included liver, kidney, spleen, gill, gonads, thymus, thyroid, heart, stomach, pyloric caeca, duodenum, rectum, pancreas, and swimbladder. 1,1-DCE produced no neoplasms at the exposure levels used and no increase in liver weight. There was no evidence of any other chronic toxic effects.",

These metabolites, especially 2,2-dichloroacetaldehyde and 2-chloroacetyl chloride, damage the liver by binding to cellular macromolecules. They also form glutathione S conjugates by the action of glutathione S-transferases located in the hepatic cytosol and microsomes. These are delivered to the kidney, where renal processing by beta-lyase and cysteine conjugate S-oxidase lead to nephrotoxic products. The metabolites are also known to damage the bronchiolar Clara cells in the lung. (L185)",

Under the draft revised guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment (U.S. EPA, 1999), EPA concludes 1,1-DCE exhibits suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity but not sufficient evidence to assess human carcinogenic potential following inhalation exposure in studies in rodents. Male mice developed kidney tumors at one exposure in a lifetime bioassay, a finding tempered by the absence of similar results in female mice or male or female rats and by the enzymatic differences (i.e., CYP2E1) between male mice and female mice, male and female rats, and human kidney cells. Limited evidence of genotoxicity has been reported in bacterial systems with metabolic activation. The data for 1,1-DCE are inadequate for an assessment of human carcinogenic potential by the oral route, based on the absence of statistically or biologically significant tumors in limited bioassays in rats and mice balanced against the suggestive evidence in male mice in a single bioassay by inhalation and the limited evidence of genotoxicity. The human epidemiological results on the carcinogenicity of 1,1-DCE are too limited to draw useful conclusions. EPA concludes that the results of kidney tumors in one sex and one exposure in a single species of rodents are too limited to support an exposure-response assessment.",

Increased incidences of renal tubule carcinoma and respiratory epithelium adenoma in the nose of male rats were also considered to be related to vinylidene chloride exposure. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of vinylidene chloride in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of C-cell adenoma or carcinoma in the thyroid gland and systemic mononuclear cell leukemia. Occurrences of malignant mesothelioma may have been related to vinylidene chloride exposure. There was  clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of vinylidene chloride in male B6C3F1/N mice based on increased incidences of renal tubule adenoma and carcinoma. Increased incidences of hepatocholangiocarcinoma may have been related to vinylidene chloride exposure. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of vinylidene chloride in female B6C3F1/N mice based on increased incidences of systemic hemangioma or hemangiosarcoma (combined). Hepatocholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in the liver of female mice were also considered to be related to vinylidene chloride exposure.

Pretreatment with 3-methylcholanthrene produced marked proliferation of membranes of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in Clara cells, while similar pulmonary cellular reactivity was not evoked by administration of phenobarbital. Administration of SKF-525A in conjunction with 1,1-DCE resulted in loss of apical bulges characteristic of Clara cells and, concomitantly, a reduction in smooth endoplasmic reticulum. ... No potentiation in hepatocellular necrosis by pretreatment with phenobarbital was noted. Pretreatment with 3-methylcholanthrene provided a small degree of protection from pulmonary and hepatic injury. Pretreatment with SKF-525A indicates that alkylation reactions in the lung appear to be directed to macromolecules which are not critical to the integrity of Clara cells, or occurred at noncritical sites, while those in the liver may not follow similar patterns of reactivities. Prior treatment of piperonyl-butoxide exacerbated injury in both lung and liver, but elicited no alterations in concentrations of covalently bound 1,1-DCE. These results suggest the lack of an association between pneumotoxicity and metabolism through a P448 dependent pathway.",

Serum alanine-aminotransferase was used to monitor onset, peak, and extent of liver damage. L-2-oxothiazolidine-4- carboxylate pretreated rats showed consistently lower serum alanine- aminotransferase activities 2 to 24 hr after 1,1-dichloroethylene. Alanine-aminotransferase activities in L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate pretreated rats exceeded control levels at about 4 hr after 1,1-dichloroethylene treatment compared to only 2 hr in the saline pretreated group. Peak alanine-aminotransferase values were approximately ten fold lower in the L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate treated animals indicating a protective effect of L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate on 1,1-dichloroethylene hepatotoxicity. This protection was associated with about 50% less total, acid soluble and acid precipitable 1,1-dichloroethylene in serum, 30% less in urine and at 24 hr 30 to 68% less covalently bound in the liver, kidney and lung. Peak liver injury correlated well with the amount of 1,1-dichloroethylene in serum at early times and with the amount covalently bound to liver at 24 hr. There was only a poor correlation with 1,1-dichloroethylene in the urine. Fasted rats demonstrated a persistent loss of hepatic cytochrome p450 at 3 and 6 hr whereas their hepatic and renal reduced glutathione contents were transiently diminished at 3 hr. The L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate induced loss of hepatic cytochrome p450 which converted 1,1-dichloroethylene to reactive intermediates, contributed to the apparent decrease in toxin metabolism and therefore to the L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate protection against 1,1-dichloroethylene induced liver injury.",

Data from available studies have been insufficient to correlate levels of 1,1-dichloroethene in the environment with levels in breath. ... Exposure to 1,1-dichloroethene (depending on dose and duration of exposure) increases serum levels of certain liver enzymes such as SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), and others, which is taken as an indication of liver injury. However, this effect is caused by other halogenated alkenes as well such as vinyl chloride, and cannot be considered as a specific indicator of 1,1-dichloroethene effects.",

Groups of female CD-1 mice were treated with 1,1-dichloroethylene (DCE) (75 mg/kg ip) or corn oil. Using an antibody directed against DCE-cysteine conjugates, adducts were detected primarily in association with mitochondria in the apices of bronchiolar Clara cells. Furthermore, morphological studies demonstrated early mitochondrial alterations in Clara cells that included severe swelling and disruption of cristae. Western blotting of lung cytosolic proteins showed greater immunoreactivity for cytochrome c in fractions from mice treated with DCE for 4 h than in controls. Immunohistochemical studies with an antibody to activated caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling were used to detect apoptotic cells. In both experiments, positive reactivities were observed in the bronchiolar epithelium at 12 and 24 hr after DCE treatment, whereas reactivities were absent in tissues from control animals. Finally, bronchiolar epithelial cells showing morphological criteria of apoptosis (chromatin condensation and margination) were observed at 24 hr after 75 and 125 mg/kg DCE. Apoptotic-like cells were more abundant in larger bronchioles. These data suggested that DCE produces pulmonary bronchiolar apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial perturbations, causing release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and caspase activation.",

The metabolic basis for the species- and sex-specific nephrotoxicity and /renal/ tumorigenicity of 1,1-dichloroethene /was examined/. Kidney microsomes from male mice biotransformed 1,1-dichloroethene to chloroacetic acid; the amounts of chloroacetic acid formed were dependent on the hormonal status of the animals and correlated well with the ability of kidney microsomes to oxidize p-nitrophenol and chlorozoxazone, specific substrates for cytochrome P450 2E1. In kidney microsomes from naive females, significantly lower rates of oxidation of 1,1-dichloroethene, p-nitrophenol, and chlorozoxazone were observed; oxidation could be induced by testosterone. With a rabbit anti-rat liver cytochrome P450 2E1 antibody, a cross-reactive protein was detected in male mouse kidney microsomes with a molecular weight very similar to that of rat liver cytochrome P450 2E1; the expression of this protein was regulated by testosterone and correlated well with the ability of the microsomes to oxidize p-nitrophenol, chlorozoxazone, and 1,1-dichloroethene. When the relative cytochrome P450 2E1 contents of renal microsomes of male mice from different strains were compared, differences in the expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 were observed. Moreover, nephrotoxicity in Swiss-Webster mice after inhalation of 1,1-dichloroethene was observed only in males and testosterone-treated females, but not in naive females. In kidney microsomes obtained from both sexes of rats and in six samples of human kidney (male donors), no p-nitrophenol oxidase activity was detected. These data suggest that cytochrome P450 2E1 or a P450 enzyme with very similar molecular weight, substrate specificities, and immunological properties is expressed only in male mouse kidney and bioactivates 1,1-dichloroethene.",

Intraperitoneal administration of 125 mg/kg vinylidene chloride to male CD-1 mice also resulted in necrosis and covalent binding of vinylidene chloride-derived radioactivity in lung Clara cells ... .

In November, 2002, the Dow Chemical Company submitted its tier 1 assessment of Vinylidene Chloride for the VCCEP. EPA's OPPT has reviewed this assessment and has concluded the following: (1) EPA agrees that all tier 1 exposure analyses have been conducted. For VCCEP, EPA does not recommend any tier 2 exposure studies. (2) EPA agrees that all tier 1 toxicology studies have been conducted. EPA also notes that most tier 2 toxicology studies have been conducted.

We exposed groups of 50 male and 50 female rats to atmospheres containing vapors of vinylidene chloride at concentrations of 25, 50, or 100 parts per million (ppm) for six hours per day, five days per week for two years; groups of mice were similarly exposed to atmospheres containing 6.25, 12.5, or 25 ppm of vinylidene chloride. Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats and mice exposed to clean air in the same type of inhalation chambers served as the control groups. Tissues from more than 40 sites were examined for every animal. All groups of male and female rats and mice exposed to vinylidene chloride had extensive non-cancerous lesions of the epithelium of the nose, including inflammation, metaplasia, hyperplasia, and atrophy. Male rats had markedly increased incidences of malignant mesotheliomas and some rare adenomas of the respiratory epithelium of the nose. Female rats had increased incidences of thyroid gland cancers and mononuclear cell leukemia. Male mice had marked increases of uncommon benign and malignant tumors of the kidney and female mice had increased incidences of hemangioma or hemangiosarcoma in all organs and a variety of liver tumors. We conclude that exposure to vinylidene chloride by inhalation caused malignant mesothelioma and cancers in the nose in male rats, thyroid gland cancers and mononuclear cell leukemia in female rats, kidney cancers in male mice, and hemangioma or hemangiosarcoma in all organs and liver tumors in female mice. A spectrum of nonneoplastic lesions in the nose of male and female rats and mice were caused by vinylidene chloride exposure.",

In subchronic studies, groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of either sex were administered vinylidene chloride in corn oil by gavage five times per week at 0, 5, 15, 50, 100, or 250 mg/kg body weight for 13 weeks. At the end of this study, representative tissues from these animals were subjected to histopathological examination. The liver was identified as a target organ for vinylidene chloride toxicity. In the 104-week chronic exposure study, conducted primarily to determine possible carcinogenic potential of vinylidene chloride by the oral route, 50 F344/N rats and 50 B6C3F1/N mice of either sex were gavaged with vinylidene chloride suspended in corn oil at dose levels of 1 or 5 mg/kg (rats) and 2 or 10 mg/kg (mice). Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of either sex received corn oil alone and served as vehicle controls. Throughout most of the study, mean body weights of the dosed rats of either sex and high-dose female mice were slightly lower than those of the controls. The absence of compound-related effects on survival or clinical signs suggests that the rats and mice of either sex could have tolerated higher doses. While no significant differences in survival were observed for any group of rats, 12 control and 10 low-dose males were killed accidentally during week 82; this may have compromised the sensitivity of the male rats study. The results of histopathological examination indicated an increased incidence of necrosis of the liver in high-dose male and low-dose female mice and chronic renal inflammation in high-dose rats of either sex. The only observed significant (P>0.05) increase in tumor incidence occurred in low-dose female mice: lymphoma (2/48, 9/49, 6/50) and lymphoma or leukemia (7/48, 15/49, 7/50). These increases were not considered to be related to vinylidene chloride administration because similar effects were not found in the high-dose female mice or in male mice or rats. Under the conditions of this bioassay, vinylidene chloride administered by gavage was not carcinogenic for F344/N rats or B6C3F1/N mice of either sex. However, since the use of a maximum tolerated dose in this study has not been clearly demonstrated and since previously reported studies have shown that carcinogenicity is associated with inhalation exposure to vinylidene chloride, this study should not be taken as proof that the chemical is not a carcinogen.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 600 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1-dichloroethylene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,1-dichloroethylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl and nitrate radicals; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 1.5 and 27 days, respectively. When adsorbed on silica gel, 1,1-dichloroethylene undergoes photolysis; approximately 72% of it degrades on exposure to 170 hours of sunlight. If released to soil, 1,1-dichloroethylene is expected to have high mobility based upon Koc values of 64-65. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.0261 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1-Dichloroethylene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 1,1-Dichloroethylene had a biodegradation rate of 0.050 ug/g soil/hr in soil from Skellingsted landfill in Holback, Denmark, incubated with methane. Under simulated landfill anaerobic conditions, 1,1-dichloroethylene degraded in 1-3 weeks. If released into water, 1,1-dichloroethylene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. In anaerobic microcosms designed to simulate a groundwater environment, 50% of the 1,1-dichloroethylene disappeared in 5-6 months. However, 1,1-dichloroethylene had a biodegradation half-life of 1.25 years in ground water from a former manufacturing facility in New Jersey. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. BCFs of <13, measured in fish, suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A hydrolysis half-life of 6-9 months has been observed for 1,1-dichloroethylene at pH 4.5 to 8.5. Occupational exposure to 1,1-dichloroethylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1-dichloroethylene is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,1-dichloroethylene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 1,1-dichloroethylene.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.0261 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively(SRC). A hydrolysis half-life of 6-9 months has been observed for 1,1-dichloroethylene at pH 4.5 to 8.5(6). According to a classification scheme(7), BCFs of <13 measured in carp(8), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. In anaerobic microcosms designed to simulate a groundwater environment, 50% of the 1,1-dichloroethylene disappeared in 5-6 months(9). However, 1,1-dichloroethylene had a biodegradation half-life of 1.25 years in ground water from a former manufacturing facility in New Jersey(10).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Contaminated drinking water wells in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maine had maximum 1,1-dichloroethylene concentrations of 280, 118, and 70 ppb, respectively(3). In a nationwide survey, 1,1-dichloroethylene was detected in 7.1% of samples from groundwater sources(4). 1,1-Dichloroethylene was not detected in groundwater at golf courses tested across the US(5). An assessment of untreated ambient groundwater in the US from 1985 to 1995 was conducted as part of the National Water Quality Assessment Program; 1,1-dichloroethylene was detected in 12 of 397 urban wells at 0.2-11 ug/L and 7 of 2414 rural wells at 0.4-39 ug/L(6). 1,1-Dichloroethylene was detected in 10% of 95 monitoring wells (80 urban, 15 agricultural) in Glassboro, NJ from 1996 to 1998(7). In a National water-quality assessment program run on groundwater samples from May 3, 1999 to Oct 23, 2000, 1,1-dichloroethylene was detected at 0.22-23 ug/L in 8 of 579 samples collected across the country(8).

In 1979, the highest reported concentration of 1,1-dichloroethylene in drinking water in the US was 0.1 ug/L(2). 1,1-Dichloroethylene was detected in drinking water samples from 2 of 103 US cities at 0.2-0.51 ug/L; drinking water was derived from surface water(3). In drinking water samples derived from ground water, 1,1-dichloroethylene was detected in samples from one of the 13 US cities sampled at 0.2 ug/L(3). According to the US Groundwater Supply Survey (945 supplies derived from groundwater chosen both randomly and on the basis that they may contain VOCs) 24 samples were positive for 1,1-dichloroethylene at 0.2-6.3 ug/L(4). Mean and maximum concentrations of 1,1-dichloroethylene in three New Jersey drinking water supplies sampled 1981-1983 were 0.1-0.2 and 0.9-2.5 ppb, respectively(5). In a screening ending Jun 30, 1984 of 1174 community and 617 private drinking water wells in Wisconsin, 1 community and 3 private wells had detectable levels of 1,1-dichloroethylene(6). 1,1-Dichloroethylene was detected at a maximum concentration of 78 ug/L in 72 of 7712 public drinking water wells in California that were sampled 1984 and 1990(7). 1,1-Dichloroethylene was detected in 50% of 30 public supply wells in Glassboro, NJ from 1996 to 1998(8). In a survey taken in California from 1995 to 2001, 1,1-dichloroethylene was detected in 1.9-2.7% of 59,695 samples, from 9230 sources in 2512 systems with average concentrations of 3.4-6.0 ug/L(9). In a 2006 national drinking water survey, conducted by the US Geological Service, 1,1-dichloroethylene was detected in 19 of 1207 (1.6%) drinking well water samples from data collected 1985-2002(10).

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home.

The Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety (Panel) assess the safety of ingredients for use in cosmetics. The function of an ingredient in cosmetics is noted. The Panel reviews the data relevant to the safety of an ingredient and concludes whether an ingredient is safe in cosmetics in the present practices of use and concentration described in a safety assessment.",

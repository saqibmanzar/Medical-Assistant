ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The presence of six phenolic hydroxyl groups and two aldehydic groups makes gossypol chemically reactive. Gossypol can undergo Schiff base formation, ozonolysis, oxidation, and methylation to form gossypol derivatives. Gossypol and its derivatives have been the target of much research due to their multifaceted biological activities including antifertility, antivirus, anticancer, antioxidant, antitrypanosomal, antimicrobial, and antimalarial activities. Because of restricted rotation of the internaphthyl bond, gossypol is a chiral compound, which has two atropisomers (i.e., (+)- and (-)-gossypol) that exhibit different levels of biological activities.",

The apoptotic effect of gossypol, however, has been demonstrated to be attenuated by the presence of androgen in a prostate cancer xenograft mouse model (Vertebral Cancer of Prostate [VCaP]) treated with AT-101 (R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid). This study was undertaken to better understand the in vitro effects of androgen receptor (AR) on AT-101-induced apoptosis. VCaP cells treated with AT-101 demonstrated an increase in apoptosis and downregulation of Bcl-2 pro-survival proteins. Upon AR activation in combination with AT-101 treatment, apoptosis is reduced, cell survival increases, and caspase activation is attenuated. Akt and X inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) are downregulated in the presence of AT-101, and AR stimulation rescues protein expression. Combination treatment of bicalutamide and AT-101 increases apoptosis by reducing the expression of these pro-survival proteins. These data suggest that combination therapy of AT-101 and ADT may further delay the onset of AI disease, resulting in prolonged progression-free survival of prostate cancer patients. .",

Fifteen patients had glioblastoma, 11 patients anaplastic astrocytoma, 1 patient relapsed low grade glioma. Response was assessed every 8 weeks using CT/MRI scan and clinical criteria including decadron requirement. Treatment was continued until disease progression. Two patients had partial response (PR); 4 had stable disease for 8 weeks or more. One patient maintained a PR with improved KPS for 78 weeks. The other had a PR lasting 8 weeks. Toxicity was mild: 2 heavily pretreated patients had mild thrombocytopenia, 5 patients developed hypokalemia, 3 patients developed grade 2 hepatic toxicity and peripheral edema. Gossypol levels measured by HPLC did not correlate with response or toxicity in this study. We conclude that gossypol is well tolerated and has a low, but measurable, response rate in a heavily pretreated, poor-prognosis group of patients with recurrent glioma...",

This review summarizes the extensive investigations on formal animal toxicology and on the recovery of fertility in men after stopping gossypol treatment which led to the decision by the Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP) at the World Health Organization (WHO), that gossypol would not be acceptable as an antifertility drug. ... There have been reports that studies conducted in China confirm the efficacy of gossypol as a male antifertility drug. ...  Studies conducted by the International Organization for Chemical Sciences in Development showed that 40 of the 70 highly purified, novel structural forms of gossypol were no more active than gossypol. Experiments conducted on Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgous monkeys confirm that either (-) or (+) gossypol is too toxic to be developed for human contraception. Among the side effects associated with the use of gossypol, the most serious was hypokalemic paralysis, although differences in reported incidences could be attributed to the regional differences in dietary intake of potassium and genetic predisposition. On the other hand, studies that examine the risk of permanent sterility among healthy reproductive males were confirmed by two separate studies, which found an incidence of 25% irreversible sterility. The failure of recovery among those who stopped gossypol use could be attributed to longer treatment, greater total dose of gossypol, smaller testicular volume, and elevated follicle stimulating hormone concentrations...",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Gossypol was found to be cytotoxic in HL-60 cells with the IC(50) dose of 4.5 microM. The combination of gossypol and okadaic acid in IC(50) doses revealed the increased cytotoxicity in a time-dependent manner. Treatment of cells with gossypol has shown significant decrease in PP2A activity. The expression of the PP2A catalytic subunit was downregulated in gossypol-treated cells with 24 hours' intervals. hTERT mRNA levels were gradually decreased. In conclusion, during gossypol-induced cytotoxicity, intracellular activity and expression of PP2A was decreased as well as the activity of hTERT. The variation of hTERT activity in gossypol-treated HL-60 cells may be the potential reason for the phosphatase interaction during the gossypol treatment of leukemic cells resulting in cellular cytotoxicity.",

Since chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express high levels of antiapoptotic proteins that act as a survival mechanism for these replicationally quiescent lymphocytes, we investigated whether gossypol induces apoptosis in these cells and what mechanism underlies gossypol-mediated cytotoxicity. Gossypol induced cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; 24-hour incubation with 30 uM gossypol resulted in 50% cell death (median; range, 10%-80%; n = 47) that was not abrogated by pan-specific caspase inhibitor. Starting at 4 hours, the mitochondrial outer membrane was significantly permeabilized (median, 77%; range, 54%-93%; n = 15). Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabiliztaion (MOMP) was concurrent with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, antioxidants did not abrogate gossypol-induced cell death. Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization was also associated with loss of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), activation of BAX, and release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which was translocated to the nucleus. Blocking AIF translocation resulted in a decreased apoptosis, suggesting that AIF contributes to gossypol-mediated cytotoxicity in CLL lymphocytes.",

The (-)-gossypol enantiomer is a more potent inhibitor of cancer cell growth. Here, the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induced by (-)-gossypol were studied in human prostate cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the prostate cancer cell DU-145 had been treated with (-)-gossypol, the trypan blue exclusion assay and DNA fragment end-labeling assay were used to stain the dead cells and to detect DNA laddering, respectively. The effects of (-)-gossypol on the expression of apoptotic-regulated gene markers in both death receptor- and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways, such as the Bcl-2 family and caspase, etc., were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. To further investigate the apoptotic pathways induced by (-)-gossypol, different caspase inhibitors were used to block caspase activities and cell viability was detected by the CellTiter 96 AQueous assay in DU-145 cells. RESULTS: At a 5-10 microM dose-level, (-)-gossypol significantly enhanced apoptosis measured by DNA fragmentation. (-)-Gossypol caused apoptosis in DU-145 cells through the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and the up-regulation of Bax at the mRNA and protein levels. (-)-Gossypol also activated caspases-3, -8 and -9 and increased PARP [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase] cleavage. Furthermore, (-)-gossypol-induced apoptosis might be due to an increase in CAD (caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease) proteins and a decrease in ICAD (inhibitor of CAD) proteins. By using caspase inhibitors, (-)-gossypol caused apoptosis via the caspase-dependent pathways. CONCLUSION: /These/ results indicated that the apoptotic processes caused by (-)-gossypol are mediated by the regulation of the Bcl-2 and caspase families in human prostate cancer cells. /The/ data also suggested that (-)-gossypol may have chemotheraputic benefits for prostate cancer patients.",

Thus pharmacological agents that are safe and can sensitize the tumor cells to TRAIL, are urgently needed. ... Whether gossypol, a BH3 mimetic that is currently in the clinic, can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis /was examined/. Intracellular esterase activity, subG1 cell cycle arrest, and caspase-8, -9, and -3 activity assays revealed that gossypol potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human colon cancer cells. Gossypol also downregulated cell survival proteins (Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, survivin, XIAP, and cFLIP) and dramatically upregulated TRAIL death receptor (DR) 5 expression but had no effect on DR 4 and decoy receptors. Gossypol-induced receptor induction was not cell type-specific, as DR5 induction was observed in other cell types. Deletion of DR5 by small interfering RNA significantly reduced the apoptosis induced by TRAIL and gossypol. Gossypol's induction of the death receptor required the induction of CHOP, and thus, gene silencing of CHOP abolished gossypol-induced DR5 expression and associated potentiation of apoptosis. ERK1/2 activation but not p38 MAPK and JNK activation also was required for gossypol-induced TRAIL receptor induction; gene silencing of ERK abolished both DR5 induction and potentiation of apoptosis by TRAIL. ... Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by gossypol treatment was critical for TRAIL receptor induction and apoptosis potentiation. Overall, our results show that gossypol enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the downregulation of cell survival proteins and the upregulation of TRAIL death receptors through the ROS-ERK-CHOP-DR5 pathway.",

Three individuals from each line were randomly assigned to a cage and fed a corn-soybean meal (control) diet for 14 d. Six cages per line were then randomly assigned 1 of 4 dietary treatments (1,000 mg/kg of gossypol, 1,000 mg/kg of silymarin, 1,000 mg/kg of both gossypol and silymarin, or a control diet). Body weight and feed intake data were collected for 21 d, with chickens bled weekly to collect plasma and determine hematocrits. Chickens were then killed, and livers were collected for subsequent histology and enzymatic activity analyses. Endpoints measured weekly were analyzed with repeated measures and regression methodologies. Plasma and liver enzyme activities, and histological measures, were analyzed using ANOVA. No significant interactions between diets and lines were observed. Chickens assigned to the gossypol and gossypol-silymarin diets stopped gaining weight at d 14 (P < 0.001) and lost weight by d 21 (P < 0.001). Gamma glutamyltransferase was also elevated in these chickens at d 14; activities increased further by d 21 (P < 0.001). Histological examination of liver slices indicated substantial lipidosis (P < 0.001). Furthermore, quinone reductase activity was higher in gossypol- and gossypol-silymarin-treated chickens than in control and silymarin-treated chickens (P < 0.001). Silymarin did not alleviate any clinical effects of gossypol toxicosis.",

Rats were allocated into four groups: control group and three GAA-treated groups (2-4), that were injected with GAA (5, 10, 20mg/kg BW, respectively), through intraperitonial injection. Treatment of GAA was found to elicit a significant decrease in sperm counting, sperm motility, serum levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, whereas, the activities of testicular 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17-ketosteroid reductase were increased. The activities of serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase and hepatic glutathione peroxidase; glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase and the level of hepatic glutathione were elevated. While, the lipid peroxidation end product; malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and lipid profile and the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 were decreased in GAA-treated rats. The histological analysis of liver and testicular tissues showed severe hepatocyte damage in addition to abnormal localization of hepatocytic nuclei. Also, the testicular pathology of GAA-treated rats showed depressed spermatogensis, sertoli cell toxicity and degeneration of seminiferous tubules./Gossypol acetic acid/",

Rabbit semen belonging to adult males (n = 5; 12-14 months) were cultured with UNFIL GOS and FIL GOS (5% solution) and subsequently diluted (1:1-7) for analysis using a Computer Assisted Semen Analyzer (CASA) system in 5 time periods (0, 60, 120, 180 and 360 minutes). At Time 0, no significant change in rabbit spermatozoa motility (MOT) and progressive motility (PROG) with GOS FIL was noted, while increases were observed with GOS UNFIL. At Time 60, weak changes were noted for MOT and PROG. After 120 minutes of culture with both GOS FIL and GOS UNFIL, MOT and PROG decreased significantly in some experimental groups. However, no differences were recorded for both the parameters at Times 180 and 360, with the exception of PROG in the GOS UNFIL category (groups A, B, E, F and G), where a significant decrease was noticed. Detailed evaluation of the distance and velocity parameters revealed reduction in all these studied markers after 60 and 120 minutes of in vitro culture with both GOS FIL and GOS UNFIL, indirectly confirming the PROG decrease. Straightness (STR), linearity (LIN), wobble (WOB), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH) and beat cross frequency (BCF) mostly remained unaltered at all time periods for GOS FIL, where as some minor alterations were noticed in GOS UNFIL category for STR, LIN, WOB, ALH and BCF parameters at Time 0, 60 and 120. /This/ study confirms the dose and time dependent alterations of rabbit spermatozoa motility parameters by GOS...",

Previous work ... revealed that the pubertal period of reproductive development in the male rat was particularly vulnerable to gossypol exposure, with a higher frequency of round structures in the lumen of the cauda epididymidis in the treated rats. Herein, we utilized hemicastration and electron microscopy to confirm that the epididymis is a definitive target of gossypol. Although exposure to gossypol from weaning through puberty caused a significant decrease in daily sperm production, as well as in the concentration of sperm in the epididymis, serum testosterone levels and reproductive organ weights were not altered. In gossypol treated rats, sperm morphology was compromised severely, but the epithelium in testis and epididymis appeared morphologically normal. Ultrastructural examination revealed that round structures, present only in gossypol exposed males, represented: (1) principal cells exfoliated from the epididymal epithelium; (2) epididymal epithelial cell cytoplasm containing degenerating sperm; and (3) degenerating epithelial cells, consisting of vesicles and particles of different sizes, forms and densities. Taken together, the data confirm that gossypol targets the epididymis, disturbing both the structure and function of this organ, and presumably disrupts sperm maturation.",

It is a natural polyhydroxy dinaphthalene found in cottonseed kernels. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.1X10-21 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates gossypol will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase gossypol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Gossypol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, gossypol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.2X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-28 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, gossypol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3,300 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to gossypol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where gossypol is produced or used. Source data indicate that the general population may be exposed to gossypol via ingestion of cottonseed oil or consumer products containing cottonseed oil. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

Due to its flexible structure, dequalinium was investigated to build drug and gene delivery systems.  First used as an antiseptic and disinfectant in the 1950s, dequalinium is still found in various OTC products to treat conditions of oral infections and inflammation. It is also used in vaginal tablets to treat bacterial vaginosis.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Dequalinium has a rapid bactericidal and fungicidal action. The antiparasitic and antiviral properties of dequalinium have also been noted. For example, dequalinium can bind to the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the spike envelope of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1.  As with other quaternary ammonium compounds similar to dequalinium, gram-positive bacteria are more sensitive to dequalinium than gram-negative bacteria. The bactericidal and fungicidal effects of dequalinium can occur within 30 to 60 minutes. According to _in vitro_ studies, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for dequalinium against relevant vaginal pathogens ranges from 0.2 to \u2265 1024 \u00b5g/mL.  There is evidence that dequalinium exhibits anticancer activity in human leukemia cells: dequalinium induces a cytotoxic effect by altering redox balance, downregulating Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways, and promoting apoptosis of leukemic cells. Dequalinium was also shown to block small conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels, called SK channels, which are often expressed in some cancer cells to play a role in cell proliferation and migration. One study showed that dequalinium reduced macrophage motility in mice, inhibiting macrophage infiltration of irradiated tumours and attenuating local metastasis.  Interestingly, dequalinium was shown to modulate and induce self-oligomerization of alpha-synuclein, a synaptic protein known to cause aggregates in several neurodegenerative disorders. This finding highlights the neuroprotective actions of dequalinium; however, further investigations are warranted as dequalinium is a neurotoxic agent.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Dequalinium absorbs into the bacterial cell surface and diffuses through the cell wall, disrupting bacterial cell permeability. It is taken up by the bacteria rapidly. Once in the bacteria, dequalinium denatures proteins involved in the respiratory chain and glycolysis of bacteria, interfering with bacterial cell metabolism and ribosomal protein synthesis. By inhibiting bacterial F1-ATPase, dequalinium inhibits mitochondrial ATP synthesis and blocks glucose metabolism. These molecular actions ultimately deplete bacterial energy sources. As dequalinium accumulates in the mitochondria, it is considered a mitochondrial poison.  Dequalinium can also precipitate nucleic acids, as it can intercalate one of its quinoline chromophores between DNA base pairs. Depending on the drug concentration, dequalinium can lyse the bacterial cell by promoting osmotic imbalance.",

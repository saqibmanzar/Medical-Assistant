PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The disposition, metabolism, elimination and transplacental uptake of [phenyl-U-(14)C]TOCP and/or its metabolites, in pregnant and non-pregnant mice, were examined. Pregnant (18th-day gestation) and non-pregnant, ICR mice were given an i.v. dose of [(14)C]TOCP (557 uCi kg-1; Specified activity 4.83 uCi mumol-1). At various time intervals (1, 24, 48 and 72 hr) the animals were processed for whole-body autoradiography (WBA). Over 72 hr the non-pregnant mice excreted 55% of the (14)C in the urine and 9% in the feces, while excretion in the urine and feces by the pregnant mice was 50% and 9% of the total dose, respectively. The WBA and its computer-assisted image analysis indicated extensive distribution of the (14)C label originally dosed as [(14)C]TOCP in pregnant mice and their fetuses. The retention of radioactivity in organs such as lung, spleen, gall-bladder and liver of mother and its fetuses suggest that these are the target sites of TOCP toxicity. The distribution in non-pregnant and pregnant mice and in the fetal tissues followed a similar pattern in uptake and retention until 72 hr. Brain and spinal cord had the least amount of [(14)C]TOCP. This finding may support reports that explain the insensitivity of the mice towards organophosphate-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN) of TOCP.",

TOCP is also toxic to the testis and SCOTP mimics some of this toxicity. The stability of SCOTP in vivo and its uptake by selected tissues has been measured. Total radioactivity and SCOTP-associated radioactivity were determined in male F-344 rats treated iv with 1 mg of [(14)C]-SCOTP/kg. The half-life of SCOTP in blood was 8.0 +/- 1.1 min. Testes, brain, and muscle had lower concentrations of [(14)C]-SCOTP-derived radioactivity than blood. Liver and kidney had higher concentrations of radioactivity than blood. HPLC analysis of liver, kidney, testes, and blood extracts showed that 2.8, 48, 11, and 18%, respectively, of the radioactivity present at 5 min was SCOTP. The amount of SCOTP declined rapidly, and at 30 min SCOTP could be detected only in kidney. It appears that SCOTP, although reactive, has sufficient stability to be transported from organ to organ. There is no evidence, however, of active uptake of SCOTP from blood by the testes. Evidence was obtained that SCOTP may act as an alkylating agent.",

It is generated in vivo from tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP), a component of jet engine oil and hydraulic fluids. Exposure to TOCP was proven to occur on board aircraft by finding CBDP-derived phospho-butyrylcholinesterase in the blood of passengers. Adducts on BChE, however, do not explain the toxicity of CBDP. Critical target proteins of CBDP are yet to be identified. Our goal was to facilitate the search for the critical targets of CBDP by determining the range of amino acid residues capable of reacting with CBDP and characterizing the types of adducts formed. We used human albumin as a model protein. Mass spectral analysis of the tryptic digest of CBDP-treated human albumin revealed adducts on His-67, His-146, His-242, His-247, His-338, Tyr-138, Tyr-140, Lys-199, Lys-351, Lys-414, Lys-432, and Lys-525. Adducts formed on tyrosine residues were different from those formed on histidines and lysines. Tyrosines were organophosphorylated by CBDP, while histidine and lysine residues were alkylated. This is the first report of an organophosphorus compound with both phosphorylating and alkylating properties. The o-hydroxybenzyl adduct on histidine is novel. The ability of CBDP to form stable adducts on histidine, tyrosine, and lysine allows one to consider new mechanisms of toxicity from TOCP exposure.",

Species specific differences in susceptibility to esterase inhibition were determined by comparing the extent of esterase inhibition observed in human neuroblastoma cells and hen, bovine, and rodent brain homogenates. OP protoxicants examined included tri-o-tolyl phosphate (TOTP), O-ethyl O-p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonothioate (EPN), leptophos, fenitrothion, fenthion, and malathion. Bromine activation resulted in greater AChE inhibition than that produced by RLM activation for equivalent concentrations of fenitrothion, malathion, and EPN. For EPN and leptophos, bromine activation resulted in greater inhibition of NTE than RLM. Only preincubation with RLM activated TOTP; resultant inhibition of AChE was less in hen brain (13 +/- 3%) than in neuroblastoma cells (73 +/- 1%) at 1x10-6 M. In contrast, 1x10-6 M RLM-activated TOTP produced more inhibition of hen brain NTE (89 +/- 6%) than NTE of human neuroblastoma cells (72 +/- 7%). Human neuroblastoma cells and brain homogenates from hens, the accepted animal model for study of OP-induced neurotoxicity, were relatively similar in sensitivity to esterase inhibition. Homogenates from hens were more sensitive to NTE inhibition induced by phenyl saligenin phosphate (PSP), an active congener of TOTP, than were homogenates from less susceptible species (mouse, rat, bovine). AChE of hen brain homogenates was also more sensitive than homogenates from other species to malaoxon, the active form of malathion.",

CBDP (2-(ortho-cresyl)-4H-1,2,3-benzodioxaphosphoran-2-one) is the toxic metabolite of triortho-cresylphosphate, a component of TCP. Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE; /Enzyme commission number/ [EC] 3.1.1.8) and human acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) are irreversibly inhibited by CBDP. The bimolecular rate constants of inhibition (k(i)), determined under pseudo-first-order conditions, displayed a biphasic time course of inhibition with k(i) of 1.6X10+8 M(-1) min(-1) and 2.7X10+7 M(-1) min(-1) for /two forms/ of BChE. The inhibition constants for AChE were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude slower than those for BChE. CBDP-phosphorylated cholinesterases are nonreactivatable due to ultra fast aging. Mass spectrometry analysis showed an initial BChE adduct with an added mass of 170 Da from cresylphosphate, followed by dealkylation to a structure with an added mass of 80 Da. Mass spectrometry in (18)O-water showed that (18)O was incorporated only during the final aging step to form phospho-serine as the final aged BChE adduct. The crystal structure of CBDP-inhibited BChE confirmed that the phosphate adduct is the ultimate aging product.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) first produced this condition in humans and later in sensitive animal species. OPIDN is characterized by a delay period prior to onset of ataxia and paralysis. The neuropathologic lesions are Wallerian-type degeneration of the axon and myelin in the distal parts of the large tracts in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the past decade we have demonstrated that the pathognomonic features of OPIDN are an aberrant increase in autophosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin kinase II (CaM kinase II) and an increase in phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, i.e., MAPs, tubulin, neurofilament triplet proteins, and myelin basic protein. Protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins plays a critical role in regulating the growth and maintenance of the axon. We hypothesize that, in OPIDN, hyperphosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins and axonal swelling are causally linked. Hyperphosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins decreases their transport rate down the axon relative to their rate of entry into the axon, thus leading to their accumulation. Consistent with this hypothesis is our finding of the anomalous accumulation of phosphorylated neurofilament aggregates in the central and peripheral axons of hens treated with TOCP.",

To bioassay for such phospholipids, ... OPIDN /was induced/ in hens using tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) as an inducer with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) as a negative control; and the effects on the activities of NTE, LysoPLA and PLB, the levels of PC, LPC, and glycerophosphocholine (GPC), and the aging of NTE enzyme in the brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerves were examined. The results demonstrated that the activities of NTE, NTE-LysoPLA, LysoPLA, NTE-PLB and PLB were significantly inhibited in both TOCP- and PMSF-treated hens. The inhibition of NTE and NTE-LysoPLA or NTE-PLB showed a high correlation coefficient in the nervous tissues. Moreover, the NTE inhibited by TOCP was of the aged type, while nearly all of the NTE inhibited by PMSF was of the unaged type. No significant change in PC or LPC levels was observed, while the GPC level was significantly decreased. However, there is no relationship found between the GPC level and the delayed symptoms or aging of NTE. All results suggested that LPC and/or PC homeostasis disruption may not be a mechanism for OPIDN because the PC and LPC homeostasis was not disrupted after exposure to the neuropathic OP, although NTE, LysoPLA, and PLB were significantly inhibited and the GPC level was remarkably decreased.",

The mechanism of OPIDN has not been fully understood. The present study has been designed to evaluate the role of mitochondrial dysfunctions in the development of OPIDN. Adult hens were treated with 750 mg/kg bw TOCP by gavage and control hens were given an equivalent volume of corn oil. On day 1, 5, 15, 21 post-dosing, respectively, hens were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cerebral cortex cinerea and the ventral horn of lumbar spinal cord were dissected for electron microscopy. Another batch of hens were randomly divided into three experimental groups and control group. Hens in experimental groups were, respectively, given 185, 375, 750 mg/kg bw TOCP orally and control group received solvent. After 1, 5, 15, 21 days of administration, they were sacrificed and the cerebrum and spinal cord dissected for the determination of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), membrane potential and the activity of succinate dehydrogenase. Structural changes of mitochondria were observed in hens' nervous tissues, including vacuolation and fission, which increased with time post-dosing. MPT was increased in both the cerebrum and spinal cord, with the most noticeable increase in the spinal cord. Membrane potential was decreased in both the cerebrum and spinal cord, although there was no significant difference in the three treated groups and control group. The activity of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase assayed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) reduction also confirmed mitochondrial dysfunctions following development of OPIDN. The results suggested mitochondrial dysfunction might partly account for the development of OPIDN induced by TOCP.",

The aim of this study was to examine changes in levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and of its activator, p35/p25, in the spinal cord of hens treated by TOCP. After exposure to a single dose of TOCP, groups of adult hens were examined in 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, and 18 days after exposure. CDK5, p35/p25 expression and distribution in the lumbar spinal cord were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The hens showed signs of OPIDN around day 9 after exposure. The number of p (phosphorylated) -CDK5 and p35 positive cells increased significantly. Co-localization and mislocalization of p-CDK5 and p35/p25 was identified and became evident in neurons around the 9th day. Meanwhile, CDK5, p-CDK5, p35, p25 protein levels and p25/p35 ratio were increased, and peaked around the 9th day, then decreased. Some hens' unilateral common peroneal was treated by roscovitine 3 days after TOCP exposure. Axonal transport of these nerves was faster than of their opposite side and of those simply treated by TOCP. These findings indicate aberrant activation of CDK5 may be involved in the pathogenesis of OPIDN.",

In looking for an adhesive to bond rubber to metal, /it was/ found that boiling PVC in liquids, such as tricresyl phosphate or dibutyl phosphate or dibutyl phthalate, makes it highly elastic. Nowadays triaryl phosphate is commonly used in admixture with lower cost non-phosphate plasticizers, such as phthalate esters. The triaryl phosphate imparts flame retardancy to the phthalate esters.",

Concerns about its toxicity are largely based on the tri-o-cresyl phosphate isomer content. However, the presence of other and more toxic isomers has been previously suggested. In this work, the structural isomers of TCP have been determined by two methods (experimental and semi-theoretical). First, the TCP isomers were separated by gas chromatography (GC) and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Second, after base cleavage of TCP, GC was used to quantify the cresol precursors. These results were used to calculate the TCP isomer distribution based on the assumption of a statistical distribution of the TCP isomers. The results from the two determinations showed reasonable agreement for three of the four oils studied. The o-cresyl isomers were found to be present almost exclusively as the more toxic mono-o-cresyl isomers in the concentration range 13-150 mg/L. The ability to analyse for the mono-o-cresyl isomers allows the toxicity of TCP to be based on the latter isomers rather than on the less toxic tri-o-cresyl phosphate isomer.",

Reported adverse effects after occupational exposure include reduced plasma cholinesterase activity and peripheral neuropathy. No neurological abnormalities were found after careful examination of workers exposed over several months to hydraulic fluid containing 21% TOCP and air concentrations of 1.5 mg/m3. Toxicity depends on the concentration of ortho-configured components. It should be noted that TOCP does not produce typical symptoms such as those associated with acetylcholinesterase inhibition like those seen with phosphate esters such as parathion.

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Furthermore, the influence of atropine and the concentration of tri-o-tolyl phosphate (TOTP) in the oil vehicle on the development of OPIDN were investigated. For Fyrquel EHC a neurotoxic effect was demonstrated with single oral doses of 5, 10 and 15 g/kg. Reofos 65 caused no clinical neurotoxic effect after single oral doses of 5, 10 and 15 g/kg. Redosing at day 22 with Reofos 65 did not result in clinical delayed neurotoxicity, but minor histopathological changes were found in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Atropine 10 mg/kg im delayed the onset of OPIDN caused by TOTP 1 g/kg po without affecting the final neurotoxic effect. Dilution of TOTP in large amounts of soybean oil vehicle reduced its neurotoxic effect. In conclusion, the neurotoxic potential of the hydraulic fluids was very low. The effect of atropine and the concentration of the test compound in oil vehicle should be taken into consideration when designing experiments on OPIDN.",

The organophosphates were tri-ortho-tolyl phosphate (TOTP) administered in 14 gavage doses of 75, 150 or 300 mg/kg, and chlorpyrifos, given in two 60 mg/kg subcutaneous exposures. Corticosterone was added to the drinking water at 400 ug/mL, to model aspects of chronic stress. These compounds/dosages were administered individually and in combination, with appropriate controls, giving rise to 16 experimental groups. The major neuropathologic change was the presence of axonal degeneration progressing to myelinated fiber degeneration, mainly in distal regions of selected fiber tracts and peripheral nerve, seen in animals sacrificed on experimental day 63. The cervical spinal cord and medullary levels of the sensory gracile fasciculus were most prominently affected. This axonopathy/fiber degeneration was TOTP dose-related at the 300 and 150 mg/kg levels. There was association of this lesion with inhibition of the enzyme neurotoxic esterase in hippocampal tissue from TOTP-treated rats. Such an association categorizes this disease process as organophosphate ester-induced delayed neuropathy. Neither chlorpyrifos nor corticosterone appeared to contribute to the neuropathic events or the enzyme inhibition. A cohort of rats was maintained on the corticosterone dosing, but without additional exposure to TOTP or chlorpyrifos, for an additional 27 days. When these rats were examined on day 90, the nerve fiber degeneration had progressed in all experimental groups administered the 300 mg/kg dose of TOTP (lower doses were not studied at the 90-day interval), although hippocampal neurotoxic esterase had returned to control values.",

We report results of a 90 day study which sequentially evaluated such effects in rats administered two neurotoxic OPs. Adult male Long-Evans rats were exposed to a 60 mg/kg sc dosage of chlorpyrifos on days 7 and 42. In addition, seven 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg gavage dosages of tri-orthotolyl phosphate (TOTP) were given during both the day 14-28 and 49-63 intervals. Appropriate controls were used. Rats were sacrificed on days 28, 63 and 90 days, for determination of neurotoxic esterase (NTE) levels, or perfusion-fixed for neuropathological study. Activity of NTE was diminished in a dose-related fashion by TOTP on days 28 and 63. At the latter interval, the 300 mg/kg group had regional brain activity below 50% of controls, with recovery seen at day 90. In rats administered this dose of TOTP, the distal (medullary) gracile fasciculus had occasional swollen myelinated axons on day 28. By day 63 in rats given the 300 mg/kg dose, this had evolved into prominent Wallerian-like myelinated fiber degeneration, and some lesions were also noted in more proximal levels of this tract, and in peripheral nerves. Lesser involvement was seen at the 150 mg/kg dose. On day 90, after a 4- week period without additional OP exposure, the fiber degeneration was enhanced in rats given the 300 mg/kg dose (the lower two TOTP doses were not examined at this interval). One reflection of this was the greater extent of the lesions in more proximal levels of the gracile fasciculus and peripheral nerve. These changes are related to TOTP dose. Chlorpyrifos did not elicit this lesion, nor significantly modify the TOTP effect. The nature and location of the fiber degeneration, and its association with brain NTE inhibition indicates this is OP ester-induced delayed neuropathy. This study demonstrates the post-dosing progression of this neuropathic state after cessation of multiple toxicant administration in rats.",

Adult male Long-Evans rats were provided with corticosterone in drinking water (400 ug/mL, w/v) for a total of 28 d, which led to significantly decreased weight and decreased cellularity of the thymus and spleen. Seven days after initiation of corticosterone treatment, half of the rats were given chlorpyrifos, and an additional 7 d later the 2-wk, 7-dose treatment of TOTP was initiated. During the 28-d test period, behavior of rats was evaluated using a functional observational battery (FOB), motor activity, and passive avoidance. Reductions in body weight, grip strength, and ambulatory movements occurred as a result of corticosterone treatment. Decreased body weight and grip strength were also elicited by TOTP, and the interactions of corticosterone and TOTP enhanced the effects on body weight and grip strength. Blood cholinesterase levels were obtained during the 28-d study period and found useful for monitoring OP exposure. At the end of the 28-d testing period, rats were sacrificed and activities of cholinesterase, neurotoxic esterase (neuropathy target esterase), and/or carboxylesterase were evaluated in blood, liver, and/or brain regions (basal forebrain, caudate putamen, cerebral cortex, hippocampus). All these esterases in brain were inhibited in a dose-related manner by TOTP, with some enhancement in rats drinking corticosterone-containing water. In addition, choline acetyltransferase, glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP), glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase were evaluated in one or more of the brain regions already identified. Choline acetyltransferase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities were unaffected by treatments. However, GFAP was elevated above control levels in the cerebral cortex of rats by all treatments (corticosterone, chlorpyrifos, TOTP). Neuropathological examination revealed early stages of dose-related increased distal myelinated fiber axonal degeneration seen in the medullary fasciculus gracilis at only the highest dose of TOTP (300 mg/kg).",

Daily doses of vitamin B1 (300 mg), together with 1,000 ug vitamin B12 by intramuscular injection, over 45 days may have a protective effect on the nervous system, if begun early, but no effect on regeneration of peripheral motor neurons on controlled trials. 4. Corticosteroids with dosage adjusted and tapered in accord with individual tolerances over a 30-day period may hasten regeneration. 5.Pilocarpine (10 to 20 mg daily in divided doses by subcutaneous injection) resulted in a surprising but temporary improvement in motor activity in some patients.

Eye examinations in eleven patients showed no disturbance of accommodation or oculomotion, but did reveal visual disturbances in three of the patients. The visual acuities in each eye of these patients ranged from 2/50 to 6/10. The visual fields showed no significant peripheral abnormality, but did reveal multiple pericentral scotomas in all eyes of the three patients, mostly within 20 deg of fixation, tending to be most dense in the centrocecal region. Ophthalmoscopy showed only temporal pallor of the optic nerveheads, consistent with the finding of central scotomas and suggestive of optic neuritis. However, subsequently it was shown that there was not enough tricresyl phosphate to cause significant poisoning. Also, there was evidence to implicate paraffin hydrocarbons, particularly n-hexane.",

In the past the isomer tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) was thought to be the component primarily responsible for OPIDN. It is now clear that other constituents, particularly the mono-o-esters, are not only neurotoxic but also may be more potent than pure TOCP. As a generality, the toxicity potential of a particular brand of TCP is related to its content of o-phenolic residues, whereby the maximal potential is reached when o-phenolics are 33% of the mix. Historically, human TCP toxicity has resulted from inadvertent or intentional contamination of foodstuffs or beverages. TCP products with high ortho-residues synthesized by older manufacturing methods were involved in most of these cases, and were likely much more neurotoxic milligram for milligram than TOCP. Because of the great variability of TCP products, there are no conventional workplace exposure standards. Based upon data from the hen and cat, estimated human safe exposure rates for pure TOCP are estimated to be 2.5 mg/kg for a single dose, and 0.13 mg/kg/d for repetitive exposures. These levels may also be applied to TCP when o-methyl-phenyl, o-ethyl-phenyl, and o-xylenyl components are appropriately limited during manufacture such that the TCP product is less neurotoxic than TOCP. There have been relatively few reports of toxicity associated with the manufacture or use of TCP in commerce and industry. Low vapor pressures of the constituents preclude the presence of significant quantities of TCP vapor in the atmosphere. A lubricant or other formulation containing TCP may appear in the air as a mist. By these criteria the U.S. Petroleum Oil Mist exposure standard is protective when the formulation contains 4% or less of low ortho-TCP. Exposure calculations indicate that estimated safe levels are not likely to be exceeded in the well-regulated workplace. If it is of short duration, even a heavy fog of oil particulate may not exceed the 8-hr-average inhalation exposure standard. Modern manufacturing practices tend to minimize the ortho content and thus the toxicity of TCP. Because individual TCP brands and synthesis methods vary, manufacturers should be consulted concerning the properties of their individual products.",

Although the activity of FAEES is reported in almost all organs, including plasma, the interrelationship among various proteins expressing FAEES activity in different organs/tissues is not well understood. Earlier, /it was/  reported an inhibition of FAEES activity in human hepatoma cells by tri-o-tolylphosphate (TOTP; serine esterase inhibitor). The present study was undertaken to further characterize the hepatic, plasma, and pancreatic FAEES in rats after ip injection of 10, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg TOTP in corn oil or vehicle alone. After 18 hr, animals were euthanized and FAEES activity in the plasma and postnuclear fractions of hepatic and pancreatic homogenates were assayed by measuring the ester formation following incubation with [1-(14)C]oleic acid and ethanol or methanol as substrates. Significant inhibition of FAEES activity was observed in hepatic postnuclear fraction. The esterase activity also showed a pattern similar to fatty acid ethyl and methyl ester synthesizing activity. A trend similar to hepatic synthesizing and hydrolyzing activities was also found in the plasma of TOTP-treated rats. However, no inhibition of synthetic activity toward formation of fatty acid ethyl or methyl esters or p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolyzing activity was observed in the pancreas of rats after TOTP exposure. /The/ results also show that the protein expressing FAEES activity in the pancreas does not cross-react with antibodies to rat adipose tissue FAEES using Western blot analysis, which recognizes approximately 60- and approximately 84-kDa proteins in the liver and plasma, respectively. Furthermore, the inhibition in liver is at the functional level of enzyme as no change was observed between control and treated animals by immunohistochemistry. /The authors/ conclude that fatty acid ethyl or methyl ester synthesizing enzyme(s) in the liver and plasma, which are inhibited by TOTP, are different from that present in the pancreas.",

Administration of the lowest sublethal dosage of TOCP (0.25g/Kg, 24 hours) resulted in significant inhibition (10 to 30% of control activity) of the cytoplasmic proteases tripeptidyl aminopeptidase and proline endopeptidase only. An increasing dosage of TOCP (1g/Kg for 7 days) resulted in significant inhibition (10 to 50% of control activity) of the cytoplasmic proteases alanyl aminopeptidase, leucyl aminopeptidase, tripeptidyl aminopeptidase, and proline endopeptidase, as well as the lysosomal proteases dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I and cathepsins B, D, and L. The activities of the cytoplasmic proteases arginyl aminopeptidase and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV, and of lysosomal proteases dipeptidyl aminopeptidase II and cathepsin H were not significantly altered following TOCP administration at this higher dosage. All of the above proteases are involved in the general process of intracellular protein turnover (common to all tissues), and may also have more specialized functions such as the processing of physiologically active hormonal peptides, and the processing of antigenic proteins in the immune response. Data obtained in the present study suggest that inhibition of the above enzymes by OP such as TOCP may represent a previously unrecognized toxicity hazard induced by the latter compound in higher animals.",

Rat steroidogenic tissues such as adrenocortical (AC), ovarian interstitial (OI), and Leydig cells use an intracellular pathway to store cholesterol (substrate for biosynthesis of steroid hormones) as cholesteryl ester (CE). This pathway and the pathway for uptake of serum cholesterol are less used in Leydig cells of the adult male rat, resulting in a lower CE pool. BTP and TCP caused cholesteryl lipidosis in steroid hormone-synthesizing AC and OI, but not Leydig cells in the adult rat. The objectives of this study were to determine if the administration of triaryl phosphate fluids caused a defect in the cholesterol storage pathway of AC and OI cells and to determine the mechanism of action. Female rats received daily oral doses of 0 or 0.4 g/kg TCP in sesame oil vehicle or 1.7 g/kg neat BTP for 40 days. Adrenal glands from both treatment groups and ovaries from TCP-treated rats were heavier than controls. Microscopic and biochemical studies revealed cholesteryl lipidosis composed of CE in the adrenal glands and ovaries in BTP- and TCP-treated rats with the latter group affected most severely. The activity of neutral CE hydrolase (nCEH), an enzyme that converts CE to cholesterol in the uptake and storage pathways, also was inhibited most in the TCP-treated group (97% inhibition compared to that of control). The activity of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl transferase, an enzyme that esterifies cholesterol to make CE, was depressed 27% compared to that of control adrenal glands of the TCP group, resulting in elevated intracellular cholesterol levels in AC cells. An inhibition of nCEH in the storage and uptake pathways by triaryl phosphates most likely resulted in the striking accumulation of CE in cytoplasmic lipid droplets of AC and OI cells in F344 rats.",

Recent reports implicate these compounds as endocrine and reproductive toxicants in rodents. The objectives of this study were to develop and characterize a rat model to investigate the mechanism(s) of toxicity of triaryl phosphate-based hydraulic fluids and to elucidate potential mechanistic pathways of toxicity through studies of structural/functional relationships. Groups of male and female rats received daily oral doses of either sesame oil alone or 1.7 g/kg of BTP or 0.4 g/kg TCP in sesame oil vehicle or 2.8 g/kg neat BTP for 20, 40, and 60 days. Light microscopic, morphometric, ultrastructural, and histochemical studies revealed hypertrophy and cholesteryl lipidosis of adrenocortical (both sexes) and ovarian interstitial cells that were progressive with duration of exposure. Minimal degeneration was observed in the adrenal cortex and ovary. TCP caused the most severe lesions in both the adrenal gland and ovary, but the morphologic and histochemical changes produced were similar for both compounds, suggesting a common mechanism of toxicity. Decreased testicular weight and degeneration of seminiferous tubules were detected only in TCP-treated rats. The Fischer-344 rat model using TCP and BTP administered by gavage is a valuable system to study mechanisms of endocrine and reproductive toxicity induced by triaryl phosphate-based hydraulic fluids.",

Groups of 6 hens were supplied nominal concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/L to assess a lowest level exposure inducing delayed locomotor ataxia in all treated birds. An identical trial was conducted to provide sufficient histological data. The mean measured graduated concentrations of tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate aerosol delivered in 2 parallel studies were 0.07, 0.13, 0.32 and 0.69, and 0.09, 0.20, 0.49 and 1.42 mg/L, respectively, and percent respirable particles ranged from 95.9 - 98.6%. Of the first study, 1 hen each died during or soon after 0.13 and 0.69 mg/L exposures. Mortality in the repeat study consisted of 1 hen each of the control and 0.49 mg/L exposure groups and 2 hens of 1.42 mg/L exposures. All, but one hen dying on Day 3 of a 1.42 mg/L exposure and a control hen, died during or soon after treatment. Birds exposed to concentrations at or above 0.13 mg/L demonstrated signs of respiratory distress during exposure including \"gasping\", occasional vigorous head-shaking and fluid from the beak and nostrils. Convulsions were observed in hens dying during the exposure period. Survivors of the aerosol exposures recovered from the initial signs of toxicity and subsequently demonstrated delayed neurotoxicity as moderate to severe ataxia in association with exposures to 0.20 mg/L or above. Ataxia was associated with exposures to 0.49 mg/L and higher. Marked bodyweight loss was also noted in hens of the high exposure groups. These delayed clinical findings were found to have positive histological correlates in dose-related degenerative changes of neurological tissues in all animals of 0.20 mg/L or greater exposures. Degenerative changes were limited to those hens of a 0.20 mg/L exposure that showed delayed clinical neuropathy and were unanimous among hens of higher exposures. Histopathology was characterized by degenerating fibers with myelinophages of sciatic nerve and cervical and/or thoracic spinal cord.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.9X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tri-o-cresyl phosphate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tri-o-cresyl phosphate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.2 days. Monitoring studies have observed that tri-o-cresyl phosphate is removed from the atmosphere by both wet and dry deposition. Tri-o-cresyl phosphate does not absorb UV wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tri-o-cresyl phosphate is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4.7X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Tri-o-cresyl phosphate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation in soil is expected to be an important fate based upon observed ready biodegradability in water and sediment. If released into water, tri-o-cresyl phosphate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Adsorption to suspended sediment and precipitation to bottom sediment was observed in sorption tests. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 87 and 640 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 1060 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis might be an important fate process in alkaline waters; estimated hydrolysis half-lives are 1.2 years, 43 days and 4.3 days at pH 7, pH 8 and pH 9, respectively at 25 \u00b0C. Biodegradation is an important fate process. The half-life of tri-o-cresyl phosphate in lake water, river water and sediment bottoms has been observed to range from less than 3 to 12 days and tri-o-cresyl phosphate was readily biodegradable in sewage treatment and activated sludge studies. Occupational exposure may occur through dermal contact with tri-o-cresyl phosphate at workplaces where it is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to tri-o-cresyl phosphate via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing tri-o-cresyl phosphate.

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 6.0X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tricresyl phosphate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tricresyl phosphate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 hours. Particulate-phase tricresyl phosphate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Tricresyl phosphate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tricresyl phosphate is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 4.5X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Tricresyl phosphate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Rapid biodegradation by activated sludge, with 40-60% degradation observed in a 48-hr wastewater treatment simulation, suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, tricresyl phosphate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Using a river die-away study, 100% degradation after 4 days of incubation following a lag time of 2 days was observed, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in acclimated water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 87 and 640 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An BCF range of 165 to 3700 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process in alkaline waters given estimated half-lives of 319 days at pH 7, 31.9 days at pH 8 and 3.19 days at pH 9. Occupational exposure to tricresyl phosphate may occur through inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tricresyl phosphate is produced or used; skin penetration and accidental ingestion are the main routes of toxic exposure. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to tricresyl phosphate  via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with his compound or consumer products containing tricresyl phosphate.

Tri-o-cresyl phosphate has been observed to adsorb to sediment in the water column and precipitate to the bottom in sorption studies(3). Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 87 and 640 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 1060(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 6.34(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 0.16 L/mole-sec(SRC) and a neutral hydrolysis rate constant 2.33X10-6/day(SRC) were estimated using a structure estimation method(2); this corresponds to half-lives of 1.2 years, 43 days, 4.3 and 0.43 days at pH values of 7, 8, 9 and 10, respectively(2). The half-life of tri-o-cresyl phosphate in lake water, river water and sediment bottoms has been observed to range from less than 3 days to 12 days(6,7). Tri-o-cresyl phosphate was readily biodegradable in sewage treatment and activated sludge studies(8).",

Vapor-phase tri-o-cresyl phosphate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.2 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.4X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Monitoring studies have observed that tri-o-cresyl phosphate is removed from the atmosphere by both wet and dry deposition(4).

Tricresyl phosphate has been observed to adsorb to sediment in the water column and precipitate to the bottom in sorption studies(3,4). Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur(5) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its extrapolated vapor pressure, 6.0X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4), and water solubility, 0.36 mg/L(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(5), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 87 and 640 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. According to a classification scheme(7), an observed BCF range of 165(8) to 3700(4) suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). Using a river die-away study, 100% degradation after 4 days of incubation following a lag time of 2 days was observed(6), suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in acclimated water(SRC). Aqueous hydrolysis may contribute to degradation in alkaline water. The second-order alkaline hydrolysis rate constant for tricresyl phosphate has been reported to be 0.27 /M-sec at 27 \u00b0C(9) which corresponds to half-lives of 319 days at pH 7, 31.9 days at pH 8 and 3.19 days at pH 9(SRC).",

Vapor-phase tricresyl phosphate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.9X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Monitoring studies have observed that tricresyl phosphate is removed from the atmosphere by both wet and dry deposition(4). Tricresyl phosphate does not absorb UV wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The first-order rate constant in river water ranged from approximately 0.0022 per hour at 14 \u00b0C to 0.0030 per hour at 25 \u00b0C(1); this corresponds to a half-life of about 13 days at 14 \u00b0C and 10 days at 25 \u00b0C(SRC). The first-order rate constant in bottom sediment ranged from approximately 0.0025 per hour at 14 \u00b0C to 0.0029 per hour at 25 \u00b0C(1); this corresponds to a half-life of about 12 days at 14 \u00b0C and 10 days at 25 \u00b0C(SRC). Tri-o-cresyl phosphate was completely degraded after 3 days of incubation in Lake Ontario water(2). 97% and 99% biodegradation of tri-o-cresyl phosphate occurred after 4 and 7 weeks, respectively, using an activated sludge seed and a tri-o-cresyl phosphate addition rate of 3 and 13 mg/L per 24 hours(3). In a river die-away test, using a tri-o-cresyl phosphate concentration of 26 mg/l, carbon dioxide evolution was 79% after 7 days, 82% after 28 days, and 86% after 48 days(3). In biodegradation tests using an activated sludge seed, tri-o-cresyl phosphate was observed to be biodegradable(4).",

In a river die-away study using Mississippi river water from St Louis, MO, 100% of initial tricresyl phosphate degraded after 4 days of incubation(1); after an initial lag period of 2 days when only 8% had degraded, degradation proceeded rapidly probably due to microbial adaptation(1). In a CO2 evolution study using tricresyl phosphate, 78.6% of theoretical CO2 was evolved in 7 days and 82.1% in 28 days(1). Die-away studies using a Japanese river water and Japanese bay water found that 100% of initial tricresyl phosphate was degraded after 4 days of incubation at 26 \u00b0C; at 7 \u00b0C, 75-100% was degraded after 29 days of incubation. A lag period of 1-3 days was observed before rapid biodegradation commenced(2). Tricresyl phosphate was rapidly degraded by activated sludge (40-60%) in a 48-hr wastewater treatment simulation(3).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 20 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The second-order alkaline hydrolysis rate constant for tricresyl phosphate has been reported to be 0.27 k/M-1 sec-1 at 27 \u00b0C(2) which corresponds to half-lives of 319 days at pH 7, 31.9 days at pH 8 and 3.19 days at pH 9(SRC). Based on hydrolysis data for similar triaryl phosphates(3), the neutral hydrolysis half-life for tricresyl phosphate at 20-25 \u00b0C is on the order of 1 month or longer(SRC). A hydrolysis study using Lake Ontario water from Oswego, NY found that the individual isomers of tricresyl phosphate exhibited a two-day lag period before degrading rapidly(4); the ortho- and meta-isomers were totally degraded within 4 days while about half of the p-isomer was degraded in five days(4). Hydrolysis of aryl phosphates occurs by a stepwise release of aryl alcohols and phosphoric acids(4). Tricresyl phosphate does not absorb UV wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Limited experimental observations have suggested that the triaryl phosphates in aqueous solution, including tricresyl phosphate, may degrade more rapidly under sunlight exposure than in the dark(6,7); this degradation may be due to sensitized photolysis(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

Rainbow trout BCFs of 10 for white muscle and 169 for gut and adipose tissue were measured in a flow-through system using a commercial mixture (IMOL S-140) containing 75% tricresyl phosphate and 18% trixylyl phosphate(3). A tricresyl phosphate BCF of 3700 was measured in a static-system using Gambusia fish(3). In 24-hr static tests, tricresyl phosphate (meta- and para-isomers) BCFs of 784-1420 (in rainbow trout) and 596-928 (in fathead minnow) were measured based on total 14-Carbon(4); since the 14-Carbon measurements include tricresyl phosphate metabolites, the observed BCFs indicate a worse-case estimate only(3). According to a classification scheme(5), a BCF range of 165 to 3700 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Tri-o-cresyl phosphate was found to adsorb strongly to clay minerals in sorption tests(3). Using bottom sediment from a river, tri-o-cresyl phosphate was found to adsorb strongly to the sediment with a Freundlich isotherm constant of 160(4); it was further observed that tri-o-cresyl phosphate in the water column adsorbed to sediment and precipitated to the bottom(4).",

According to a recommended classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that tricresyl phosphate is expected to be immobile in soil(SRC). Using bottom sediment from a river, the tricresyl phosphate isomers were found to adsorb strongly to the sediment; it was further observed that tricresyl phosphate in the water column adsorbed to sediment and precipitated to the bottom(3). A sediment sorption constant (Kd) of 400 has been reported for tricresyl phosphate in a marine sediment(4). In aquatic persistence studies, tricresyl phosphate and other aryl phosphates have been observed to partition rapidly from the water column to sediment; concentrations in the sediment become much greater than concentrations in the water column(5).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that tricresyl phosphate is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 87 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 640 days(SRC). The estimated  volatilization half-life from a model pond is greater than 20 years when adsorption is considered(4). Tricresyl phosphate's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). Tricresyl phosphate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based on its vapor pressure(SRC).",

Occupational exposure to tricresyl phosphate occurs through dermal contact, ingestion and inhalation of vapor; skin penetration and accidental ingestion are the main routes of toxic exposure. Due to the low volatility of tricresyl phosphate, vapor inhalation is low at normal temperatures, but can increase as tricresyl phosphate is heated for various uses(2). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to tricresyl phosphate via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with this compound or consumer products containing tricresyl phosphate(SRC).",

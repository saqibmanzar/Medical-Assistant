PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons.

The PEL can be given in three ways. [1] Time-weighted average (PEL-TWA): average exposure based on an 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Short-term exposure limit (PEL-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday. [3] Ceiling limit (PEL-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The original Montreal Protocol was agreed on 16 September 1987 and entered into force on 1 January 1989. The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

The reaction of aluminum with various halogenated hydrocarbons produces a self-sustaining reaction with sufficient heat to melt aluminum pieces, examples of other halogenated hydrocarbons are fluorotrichloromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, chlorodifluoromethane, tetrafluoromethane. The vigor of the reaction appears to be dependent on the combined degree of fluorination and the vapor pressure [Chem. Eng. News 39(27):44(1961)].",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(v) and 2.125(e)(4)(iv) is effective December 31, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(iii) is effective June 30, 2011.

FEV1 (1 sec forced expiratory volume) and flows measured at different lung volumes on the maximal effort expiratory flow volume curve were measured for 6 hr. Inhalation of freon caused no significant overall reduction in the salbutamol and ipratropium bromide response in any group. Arrhythmias only occurred among the asthmatic and bronchitic patients, and were most frequent after salbutamol. Ventricular extrasystoles occurred in 3 cases, all after salbutamol and in 2 of these in combination with freon inhalation. In 1 patient there was also hypoxia and hypercapnia. The combined effects of hypoxia, hypercapnia, catecholamines and freon on the heart are a more likely cause of arrhythmia than the effect of freon alone.",

This experiment was performed to determine if cardiac sensitization could occur in animals in the absence of an exogenous source of epinephrine as this phenomenon was alleged to cause sudden deaths in humans in the absence of exogenous epinephrine. Beagle dogs were trained to run on a treadmill to increase their circulating level of epinephrine. While being exercised, they were exposed to fluorocarbon 11, fluorocarbon 12 or fluorocarbon 114, which were tested previously and found to be capable of sensitizing the dog's heart to iv injected epinephrine. While fluorocarbon 12 and fluorocarbon 114 produced cardiac sensitization, a higher concentration was needed to produce this effect than with the iv administration of epinephrine. Cardiac sensitization was not produced by fluorocarbon 11 at the levels tested. None of the animals died.",

A possible exception is the perfluoroalkane series of nonanesthetics. The present study tested whether perfluoroalkanes do provide an exception. Further, we tested whether the convulsant effects of nonanesthetic and transitional compounds were additive. The nonanesthetic perfluoropropane caused convulsions at 7.5 +/- 0.7 atm (mean +/- SD). Convulsions also were produced by perfluorocyclobutane (0.976 +/- 0.002 atm), 1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane (0.358 +/- 0.011 atm), 2,3-dichlorooctafluorobutane (0.085 +/- 0.007 atm), 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane (0.055 +/- 0.007 atm), and flurothyl (0.00156 +/- 0.00039 atm). Of these, 1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane is a transitional compound, the remainder being nonanesthetics. The combination of flurothyl plus 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane gave evidence of antagonism (a 17% +/- 21% deviation from additivity; P < 0.05), whereas the combination of 1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane plus 2,3-dichlorooctafluorobutane gave evidence of synergy (a -13% +/- 8% deviation from additivity; P < 0.05). The combinations of perfluoropropane plus perfluorocyclobutane (-4% +/- 15%), and perfluoropropane plus 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane (-1% +/- 26%) did not produce results that deviated significantly from additivity. We conclude that pairs of these compounds either produce convulsions in an additive manner, a finding consistent with (but not proving) a common mode of action; or deviate modestly from additivity, a finding suggesting that at least a portion of the mechanistic basis for convulsions might differ, particularly for flurothyl plus other nonanesthetics, or for the combination of non-anesthetics and transitional compounds.",

Eighteen tests were performed on ten cats anesthetized with urethane. A tracheotomy was performed and 3 g of the freon mixture was sprayed for 20 sec into the opening. During the test, heart rate, breathing, and arterial pressure were monitored. The amount of freon consumed was measured by weighing the aerosol container before and after use. Within 13 sec, arterial pressure began to drop. By the end of the test, the pressure had decreased from 110 to 50 or 25 mL. Within 3 min of the end of the test, arterial pressure had returned to initial value. The sinus rhythm of the heart decreased an average of 10 strokes/min. One cat suffered an atrioventricular blockade with a subsequent fibrillation of the ventricles. Changes in frequency and depth of breathing were insignificant except for one case of brief apnea. These compounds may be cardiotoxic, and further studies are needed to determine optimum, harmless dose.",

A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin & countershock may be effective.

The length of exposure was 15, 45 or 60 seconds. Maximum expiratory flow-volume (MEF) curves and ECG were recorded before, and intermittently up to 1 hour after, exposure. Breathing level concentrations of propellants during exposure were determined by gas chromatography. All freons induced biphasic reduction of ventilatory capacity on inhalation. The first fall occurred within a few minutes of exposure while the second was delayed 13-30 minutes after exposure. The effects of mixtures were greater than those of individual freons. The relative fall in MEF 75% was more pronounced than that in MEF 50%. No clear-cut pathological changes in ECG were found. Nevertheless, most subjects developed variations in heart rate exceeding those noted before exposure. In a few cases inversion of the T wave, and in one case atrioventricular block, were observed."

Forced expiratory volume, a measure of bronchial tone, was measured in 18 children with a history of asthma, before and after inhaling aerosols of the B2-receptor agonist, fenoterol, or a mixuture of CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-114, and in the absence of treatment. The levels of exposure were not reported. Exposure to the chlorofluorocarbon mixture significantly reduced forced expiratory volume for 2 hr, relative to \"no treatment\", and for 8 hr relative to exposure to fenoterol (containing CFC-11 and CFC-12). The results suggest that chlorofluorcarbons can decrease bronchial tone in asthmatic patients, but that this effect is transient and of a sufficiently small magnitude to be superseded by the dilating effects of fenoterol when both fenoterol and chlorofluorcarbon propellants are inhaled together.",

The primary cause of the fall is a decrease in pulmonary blood flow. When blood flow to a lobe is kept constant and the adrenergic alpha receptors are blocked by injection of phentolamine, the inhalation of FC11 caused vasodilation. In the intact circulation, the vasodilation is masked by release of catecholamines which constrict the pulmonary blood vessels.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2014 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane is extremely stable in the troposphere. This compound does not react with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone molecules or nitrate radicals. 1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. This compound will gradually diffuse into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will slowly degrade due to direct photolysis from UV-C radiation and contribute to the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone. The half-life for this reaction has been estimated to range from 126 to 310 years. If released to soil, 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 280. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.25 atm-cu m/mole. 1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The Japanese MITI test indicates that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. 1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane and other chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to biodegrade under anaerobic conditions, but not aerobic conditions. If released into water, 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.8 hours and 5.2 days, respectively. Measured BCF values ranging from 15 to 32 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane is still produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane via inhalation of ambient air containing 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.25 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.8 hours and 5.2 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), measured BCF values ranging from 15 to 32(7) suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate(SRC). 1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane and other chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to biodegrade under anaerobic conditions, but not aerobic conditions(8).",

Gas-phase 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane is extremely stable in the troposphere. This compound does not react with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone molecules or nitrate radicals(3). 1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). This compound will gradually diffuse into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will slowly degrade due to direct photolysis from UV-C radiation and contribute to the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone(3).

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The half-life for this reaction has been estimated to range from 126 to 310 years(2). 1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Male Donryu-rats were exposed to methyl-n-butyl-ketone alone or in combination with methylethyl-ketone, methyl-n-propyl-ketone, methyl-n-amyl-ketone, or methyl-n-hexyl-ketone. Each ketone was injected subcutaneously in equimolar doses of 4 millimoles per kilogram, once daily, five days a week for 20 weeks. The animals were weighed biweekly and observed for signs of neurotoxicity. Maximum motor fiber conduction velocity and distal latency were measured every two weeks in the tail nerves. All treated animals showed significant decreases in body weights, relative to controls. Animals treated with methyl-n-butyl-ketone plus methyl-n-propyl-ketone, methyl-n-amyl-ketone, and methyl-n-hexyl-ketone showed greater weight decreases than those treated with methyl-n-butyl-ketone alone. Treated animals showed weakness in the hind legs. Hind leg weakness was more severe in rats treated with the combined ketone doses than with methyl-n-butyl-ketone alone. All the ketones enhanced the neurotoxicity of methyl-n-butyl-ketone as measured by decreased motor conduction velocities and prolonged distal latencies of the tail nerve. Methyl-n-hexyl-ketone had the greatest potentiating effect on methyl-n-butyl-ketone. The authors note that methyl-n-hexyl-ketone had the longest carbon chain. They suggest that the lengths of the carbon chain of the aliphatic ketones is directly related to their abilities to potentiate methyl-n-butyl-ketone neurotoxicity.",

Normal male Ssc:CF1-mice or mice with cannulated tracheas were exposed to 0 to 13,374 ppm MPK, MBK, MAK, or MHK vapor for up to 30 minutes followed by 20 minutes of recovery. Changes in respiration rate and tidal volume (VT) were monitored. Decreases in respiration rate were used as a marker of sensory irritation, which reflected activation of trigeminal nerve endings in the eyes and nose. Changes in VT were used as an indicator of pulmonary irritation. Threshold concentrations (TCs) of the compounds causing decreases in respiration rate or VT and the apparent dissociation constants for the agonist/sensory receptor (KD,app) were calculated for normal mice using dose response curves or the Michaelis-Menten equation. In normal mice, all compounds caused decreases in respiration rate indicative of sensory irritation. The respiration rates gradually increased to baseline values during the recovery period. In mice with cannulated tracheas, no sensory irritation was seen since cannulation had bypassed the trigeminal nerves. The highest concentrations of MPK, MBK, and MHK vapor induced significant increases in respiration rate during the first minutes of exposure, followed by decreases to below the baseline value. In normal mice, the mean TCs of MPK, MBK, MAK, and MHK for reducing the respiration rate were 564, 238, 277, and 75 ppm, respectively. The corresponding mean KD,apps were 4501, 2737, 5246, and 970 ppm. MPK, MBK, and MAK caused decreases in VT. MHK had no effect on VT. In cannulated mice, MPK caused a moderate decrease in VT. High concentrations of MAK caused an increase in VT. MBK and MHK did not affect VT. TCs causing decreases in VT after 11 to 20 minutes for MPK, MBK, and MAK were 178, 300, and 119 ppm, respectively. The KD,app for MPK was 2,190 ppm. KD,apps could not be calculated for MBK and MAK. The authors conclude that pulmonary responses during the first few minutes of exposure to MPK, MBK, MAK, and MHK vapor are dominated by sensory irritation. Some effects on the lower respiratory tract are induced by MAK and the highest concentrations of MBK and MHK. Assuming that the sensory irritation potential for humans can be taken to be equivalent to 20% of the TC (0.2TC), the 0.2TCs based on the first 2 minutes of exposure for MPK, MBK, MAK, and MHK are 167, 60, 53, and 15 ppm, respectively. Those for MPK and MAK are comparable to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists standards of 200 and 50 ppm."

An acute toxicity study was conducted with 5 male albino rats (strain not reported) receiving 2-octanol by aspiration. Animals were anesthetized and 0.2ml of the test substance was placed in the mouth. Animals were then placed in a vertical position with mouth open and nostrils closed at expiration to promote entry of the liquid into the trachea. Four of the five animals died instantly or within minutes after dosing. The remaining animal was sacrificed, 24 hours after dosing. Lungs were removed from all animals for examination. Animals dying within minutes of dosing were observed with bloody exudate from nostrils (2 animals) and macroscopic examination of the lung revealed petechial pulmonary hemorrhages (1 animal) and pin point pulmonary hemorrhages (1 animal). Lungs of the animal sacrificed 24 hours after dosing were normal by macroscopic examination. The average weight of lungs from the treated animals was 2.81g, and the average weight of the negative (water) controls was 1.38g. It was concluded by the authors that the death occurred due to respiratory paralysis or cardiac arrest or both, based upon the rapid cessation of respiratory or cardiac action, and lung weights and macroscopic appearance of the lungs.",

If released to the air, a vapor pressure of 1.35 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-octanone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-octanone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.6 days. 2-Octanone does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-octanone is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 460. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.88X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Octanone may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Aerobic biodegradation of this compound is expected in both soil and water. 2-Octanone, inoculated with acclimated sludge, had BOD values from 33 to 48% of the theoretical oxygen demand after 5 days incubation. If released into water, 2-octanone may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 13 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 2-Octanone is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Exposure to 2-octanone may occur occupationally during its production or use in the manufacture of other products. The general population may be exposed through the ingestion of foods, exposure to floor lacquers, furniture finishes and other items containing this compound. (SRC)",

In water, 2-octanone has a measured volatilization flux of 40 g/min/sq m; some attenuation of this process is expected due to the gas-film interface(4). A measured Henry's Law constant of 1.88X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(5) also indicates that this compound will volatilize from water surfaces. Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 6 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 13(SRC), from its log Kow(2), and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 2-Octanone is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Theoretical BOD values of 33%(8) and 48%(9,10) suggest that biodegradation may occur in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase 2-octanone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.6 days(3). 2-Octanone does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

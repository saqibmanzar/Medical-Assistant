ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

As has already been reported, mersalyl blocked the relaxing response to indoleamines but not block that to catecholamines. The relaxations in response to catecholamine-related compounds (dopa, octopamine, tyramine, phenylephrine, beta-phenylethylamine and phenylethanolamine) and hexylamine were, however, antagonized more or less effectively with mersalyl. It was suggested that the catecholamine-related compounds and hexylamine can act on relaxing nerve endings to increase neurotransmitter serotonin in the junctional clefts, and mersalyl antagonizes the relaxation in response to these compounds by blocking the serotonin.",

At the cellular level, these narcotic effects have been associated with a reduction in neuronal excitability caused by changes in membrane structure and function. In order to critically test whether changes in membrane geometry contribute to these narcotic effects, cultured human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells have been exposed to selected organic solvents. The solvent-induced changes in cell membrane capacitance were investigated using the whole-cell patch clamp technique for real-time capacitance measurements. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to the cyclic hydrocarbons m-xylene, toluene, and cyclohexane caused a rapid and reversible increase of membrane capacitance. The aliphatic, nonpolar n-hexane did not cause a detectable change of whole-cell membrane capacitance, whereas the amphiphiles n-hexanol and n-hexylamine caused an increase of membrane capacitance and a concomitant reduction in membrane resistance. Despite a large difference in dielectric properties, the chlorinated hydrocarbons 1,1,2,2-tetrachoroethane and tetrachloroethylene caused a similar magnitude increase in membrane capacitance. The theory on membrane capacitance has been applied to deduce changes in membrane geometry caused by solvent partitioning. Although classical observations have shown that solvents increase the membrane capacitance per unit area of membrane, i.e., increase membrane thickness, the present results demonstrate that solvent partitioning predominantly leads to an increase in membrane surface area and to a lesser degree to an increase in membrane thickness. Moreover, the present results indicate that the physicochemical properties of each solvent are important determinants for its specific effects on membrane geometry. This implies that the hypothesis that solvent partitioning is associated with a common perturbation of membrane structure needs to be revisited and cannot account for the commonly observed /CNS depressant/ effects of different organic solvents.",

The irritation effects rapidly reached stable levels. The concentration-response relationships followed Michaelis-Menten equations. The maximum response decreased with increasing chain length. The concentrations depressing the respiratory rate by 50% (RD-50) were 184, 121, 97, 51, and 27 p.p.m. for n-propylamine, n-butylamine, n-pentylamine, n-hexylamine, and n-heptylamine, respectively. It is suggested that the receptor is activated partly by the amines and partly by hydroxide ions. The nose has a scrubbing effect, which partly protects the lungs against water soluble irritants. Pulmonary irritation was estimated from the decrease in respiratory rate in tracheally cannulated mice. The plateau-level of the response was reached slowly. The respective concentrations depressing the respiratory rate by 50% (tRD-50) were 416, 300, 128, 66, and 36 p.p.m. for the C3-C7 n-amines. It is suggested that the pulmonary receptor environment is lipophilic and the receptor, probably the J-receptor, is activated chemically by the amines. ...",

The relaxations in response to catecholamine-related compounds (dopa, octopamine, tyramine, phenylephrine, beta-phenylethylamine and phenylethanolamine) and hexylamine were, however, antagonized more or less effectively with mersalyl. It was suggested that the catecholamine-related compounds and hexylamine can act on relaxing nerve endings to increase neurotransmitter serotonin in the junctional clefts, and mersalyl antagonizes the relaxation in response to these compounds by blocking the serotonin.",

The results showed that there was no significant evidence of chromosome aberrations after treatment. Independently of tested n-Hexylamine concentration, the results showed no evidence of gene toxicity. Therefore, it is considered that n-Hexylamine in the concentration of 144.9 ug/mL without S9 and 640.9 ug/mL with S9 does not cause genetic chromosome aberrations when CHL cells are exposed to the test chemical in the absence and in presence of S9 activation system of S9 system for 6 and 24 hr. Hence the test chemical is not likely to classify as a gene mutant in vitro.",

Methylamine and ethylamine are clearly not substrates of monoamine oxidase (MAO). n-Propylamine, n-butylamine, n-dodecylamine and n-octadecylamine are relatively poor substrates, i.e. with high Km and low Vmax values for the enzyme. n-Pentylamine, n-hexylamine, n-heptylamine, n-octylamine, n-nonylamine and n-decylamine are all very good MAO substrates. All these aliphatic amines are found to be typical type B substrates according to the sensitivities of the enzyme towards the selective MAO-B inhibitor selegiline and the MAO-A inhibitor, clorgyline. The sensitivity towards selegiline with respect to these amines is even higher, i.e. Ki = 1 x 10(-9) M for butylamine, than that of the typical type B substrate beta-phenylethylamine (Ki = 1 x 10(-8) M). The sensitivity towards selegiline decreases slightly with increasing chain length of these aliphatic amines.",

Hexylamine has been identified in Latakia tobacco leaf volitiles and in obnoxious plant smells created by volatile amines from hogweed, cow parsnip, bear's-foot, cuckoopint and hawthorn. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7.95 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates hexylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Gas-phase hexylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10.3 hours. Hexylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, hexylamine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 147. The pKa of hexylamine (conjugate acid) is 10.64, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in cation form in the environment at pH 4-8 and mostly to partially in cation form at pH 8-10 and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of cationic hexylamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process since cations do not volatilze. Volatilization of neutral hexylamine from moist soil surfaces may occur given a measured Henry's Law constant of 2.68X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Hexylamine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Most primary amines, including hexylamine, are considered to be readily biodegradable. If released into water, hexylamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The analogous compounds pentylamine and hexanediamine, reached 75 and 55% of their theoretical BOD in 2 and 3 weeks, respectively, in the Japanese MITI test which classified both as readily biodegradable. Volatilization of cationic hexylamine from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. However, estimated volatilization half-lives of neutral hexylamine for a model river and model lake are 1.5 and 14 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to hexylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hexylamine is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to hexylamine via inhalation of ambient air near various plants that emit volatile hexylamine, inhalation of tobacco smoke, and ingestion of food.

Gas-phase hexylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10.3 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.7X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Hexylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

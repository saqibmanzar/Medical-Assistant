For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Four out of 5 patients reacted to BIS-GMA, the most widely used aromatic epoxy acrylate in DCR, but not the dentist. She and 2 dental nurses were allergic to aliphatic acrylates, including triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TREGDMA) and triethylene diglycol diacrylate (TREGDA). Four patients were allergic to epoxy resin (ER) (containing mainly MW 340), possibly an impurity in some DCR. Two patients were also allergic to methyl methacrylate (MMA): the dentist had been exposed to MMA but the nurses exposure was uncertain. One patient was also allergic to rubber gloves, 2 to rubber chemicals but not their gloves, and 5 to disinfectants used. Diagnosis was delayed as long as 13 yr in spite of previous patch testing. Dermatologists need to use the patients own DCR and the methacrylate series for patch testing. Dental personnel need to know about the risks of DCR, and use no touch techniques and protective gloves.",

These compounds are presently one of the most important sources of occupational contact dermatitis. Contact sensitization to epoxy resins is usually caused by the resin itself but hardeners or other additives, such as reactive diluents, plasticizers, fillers and pigments, can occasionally be responsible. Since completely cured epoxy resins are not sensitizers, epoxy resin sensitization is always due to the presence, in the final polymer, of uncured allergenic low molecular weight oligomers. Acrylates are now considered the fourth most common cause of contact sensitization due to resins. Unpolymerized monomers of acrylic compounds are known to be responsible for the contact allergy. Accelerators, inhibitors and catalysts, which are usually added to the acrylates to promote the polymerization process, can also sensitize. Both allergic and irritant contact dermatitis may be caused by exposure to epoxy or acrylic resins and their additives. Contact urticaria, allergic or irritant airborne contact dermatitis caused by volatile compounds, onychia and paronychia can also occur. From January of 1984 to May of 1992 we detected 39 cases of occupational allergic contact dermatitis to epoxy resin system substances and 11 cases of occupational contact sensitization to acrylic compounds. In our experience, the electronics industry as well as paint and glue related activities were the most important sources of epoxy sensitization. Dental materials and anaerobic sealants were found to be the most frequent acrylate sensitizers. /Epoxy & acrylic resins/",

These data were reported as concentrations which inhibited 10% (ID10) and 50% (ID50) of a particular metabolic process as well as the range of concentrations over which cell metabolism was irreversibly inhibited. For any individual component, the ID50 values for all three metabolic parameters were of the same magnitude. The same was true for the ranges of irreversibility. Ethoxylated Bis-phenol A dimethacrylate (E-BPA) was the most toxic molecule of the group (ID50 being between 1 and 10 mumol/l). The ID50 concentrations for three of the components, including Bis-GMA, UDMA, TEGDMA, and Bis-phenol A, ranged between 10 and 100 mumol/l, while the ID50 values of three components (N,N dihydroxyethyl-p-toluidine, camphoroquinone, and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) were above 100 mumol/l. The concentrations to which the cells and tissues are exposed in vivo are not known. This study should help to identify the concentrations of organic composite components which pose clinical cytotoxic hazards.",

Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate has been detected in the Delaware River. If released to soil, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate will have moderate mobility based on an estimated Koc value of 250. Volatilization of triethylene glycol dimethacrylate is not expected to be important from moist soil surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected either based on an estimated vapor pressure of 9.4X10-4 mm Hg. Insufficient data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of triethylene glycol methacrylate in soil or water. If released to water, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based on an estimated Koc value of 250. Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate will be non-volatile from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. An estimated BCF value of 16 suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate has an estimated aqueous base catalyzed hydrolysis half-lives of 1.6 years at a pH of 8 and 16 years at a pH of 7. If released to the atmosphere, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, which has an estimated vapor pressure of 9.4X10-4 mm Hg, will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase triethylene glycol dimethacrylate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 5.7 hours. Vapor-phase triethylene glycol dimethacrylate is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with atmospheric ozone with an estimated half-life of about 12 hours. Particulate-phase triethylene glycol dimethacrylate may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. Occupational exposure may be through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase triethylene glycol dimethacrylate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 5.7 hours(3,SRC). Vapor-phase triethylene glycol dimethacrylate is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with atmospheric ozone(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 12 hours(3,SRC). Particulate-phase triethylene glycol dimethacrylate may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

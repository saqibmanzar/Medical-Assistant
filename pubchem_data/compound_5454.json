PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Thiothixene is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.",

Data collection included concomitant medications, smoking history, and demographic variables. A retrospective analysis was performed to assess the effect of these parameters on oral thiothixene clearance. When groups of patients were categorized by concomitant medications (i.e., no interacting drugs, enzyme/clearance inducers, and enzyme/clearance inhibitors), thiothixene clearance was found to be significantly increased by enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., anticonvulsants) and decreased by clearance inhibiting agents (e.g., cimetidine). Tobacco smoking significantly increased the hepatic clearance of thiothixene within the no interactions and inhibitor groups, but not in the inducer group. Significantly more patients in the inducer group had nondetectable plasma concentrations of thiothixene than the other groups. When the entire patient population was dichotomized by age, patients less than 50 years old had a significantly greater mean clearance (48.2 +/- 37.8 liters/min) versus those greater than or equal to 50 (20.0 +/- 12.6 liters/min). Men in this cohort exhibited a significantly higher clearance (49.2 +/- 38.7 liters/min) than did the women (22.0 +/- 13.5 liters/min). By taking into account these potential sources of pharmacokinetic variability when monitoring plasma thiothixene concentrations, more appropriate dosing of thiothixene may be achieved. Controlled, prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.",

Thiothixene capsules are effective in the management of schizophrenia. HUMAN STUDIES: Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene. A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Manifestations of overdose include muscular twitching, drowsiness and dizziness. Symptoms of gross overdosage may include CNS depression, rigidity, weakness, torticollis, tremor, salivation, dysphagia, hypotension, disturbances of gait, or coma. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Thiothixene may be additive with or may potentiate the action of other CNS depressants (including alcohol), anticholinergics, or hypotensive agents. ANIMAL STUDIES: In animal reproduction studies with thiothixene, there was some decrease in conception rate and litter size, and an increase in resorption rate in rats and rabbits. After repeated oral administration of thiothixene to rats (5 to 15 mg/kg/day), rabbits (3 to 50 mg/kg/day), and monkeys (1 to 3 mg/kg/day) before and during gestation, no teratogenic effects were seen.",

Ten healthy medication-free volunteers (4 women and 6 men, mean age 38 +/- 12 years) were randomized to receive a single 20 mg oral dose of thiothixene on two separate occasions. On one occasion thiothixene was given concurrently, and following 3 days of pre-treatment with oral paroxetine (20 mg/day). On the other occasion thiothixene was given without paroxetine pre-treatment. The two study days were separated by a minimum period of 2 weeks. On both study days, after the administration of thiothixene, 10 mL blood samples were collected over the next 72 hr.  None of the pharmacokinetic parameters of thiothixene were significantly altered by a 3-day treatment with paroxetine. It is likely that the CYP2D6 isoenzyme is not responsible for a high proportion of thiothixene clearance, but one cannot exclude the possibility that a longer paroxetine pretreatment might have caused some inhibition of thiothixene clearance.",

Both the activities of the splenic NK cell cytotoxicity and the effector-target cell conjugation were suppressed by thiothixine, fluphenazine, and trifluoperazine at concentrations from 2.64 to 14.78 microM. In addition, the augmentation of the cytolytic activity of NK cells induced by interferon-alpha or interleukin-2 was antagonized by pretreatment with these neuroleptic compounds. However, neither the splenic NK cell cytotoxicity nor the effector-target cell conjugation were affected by treatment with other neuroleptic compounds such as pimozide, flupenthixol, (+/-)-SKF 83566, and spiperone. Thus, it appears that neuroleptic compounds such as thiothixine, fluphenazine, and trifluoperazine may act through the mechanisms other than a dopaminergic pathway to affect the NK cell-target cell interaction.",

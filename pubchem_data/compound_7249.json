PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The subjects consisted of 76 exposed workers employed in the tar distillation process and 34 controls. ... Urinary metabolite levels were corrected for specific gravity and creatinine. The time weighted average exposure concentrations in the breathing zones of the tar distillation workers were ... 0.02 to 0.04 mg/cu m for xylenols. ... The urinary xylenol levels of exposed workers ranged from 0.12 to 0.97 mg/l with specific gravity correction. In control urine samples, the specific gravity corrected xylenol concentrations ranged from 25 x 10(-3) to 43 x 10(-3) mg/l. Significant correlations were observed between the ambient levels and urinary concentrations of phenol, o-cresol, and the xylenols, with coefficients ranging from 0.45 to 0.82. The author concludes that the biological monitoring of urinary xylenols may be used as a means of measuring xylenol exposure in coke facility workers.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

                                                    "String": "3,4-Dimethylphenol's production and use for the preparation of coal tar disinfectants, in the manufacture of artificial resins, as a constituent of coal tar creosote, as the starting material for the insecticide meobal, as a component of automobile and diesel exhaust and as a product of the combustion of vegetable materials may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. In addition, dimethylphenols, of which 3,4-dimethylphenol is an isomer, are present in essential oils of various conifers, in tea, in tobacco and tobacco smoke, in roasted coffee and in various smoked foods. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.036 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates that 3,4-dimethylphenol will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3,4-dimethylphenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.7 hours. There is potential for the direct photolysis of 3,4-dimethylphenol since a small band extends over 290 nm and thus 3,4-dimethylphenol may absorb light in the environmental UV spectrum. If released to soil, 3,4-dimethylphenol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 390. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Complete biodegradation of 3,4-dimethylphenol occurred in 9 days within a hard, carbonaceous woody loam. If released into water, 3,4-dimethylphenol is expected to adsorb very little to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Screening studies indicate theoretical oxygen demand reached 45.8% after 5 days. In addition, it has been reported that 3,4-dimethylphenol was readily degraded in St. Lawrence River water. Biodegradation under anaerobic conditions failed to occur after 24 days. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 34 days and 250 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 29 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 3,4-dimethylphenol may occur through inhalation of this compound at workplaces where 3,4-dimethylphenol is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 3,4-dimethylphenol via inhalation of ambient air (i.e., tobacco smoke and automobile exhaust), ingestion of food and drinking water, and contact with other products containing 3,4-dimethylphenol.

In 1979 EPA conducted an investigation of this area. Compound distribution at various areas about the site revealed that, in addition to groundwater leaching of soluble phenolics, insoluble contaminants were spread by a dike-breach incident and subsequent construction activities. Differences in the patterns of chemicals in various wells suggested that more than 1 source of pollution occurred. The distribution of compounds about the site indicated that a general clean-up would not be cost-effective. Placement of an intereceptor to collect groundwater seepage that contaminated surface water was considered as an alternative. One of the 43 compounds identified in soil extracts was 3,4-dimethylphenol.",

Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 34 days and 250 days, respectively(3,SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 29(3,SRC), from 3,4-dimethylphenol's log Kow(2), suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). In humic waters, degradation by the reaction with peroxy radicals should ensue with a half-life on the order of hours(7). 3,4-Dimethylphenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). Screening studies indicate that theoretical oxygen demand reached 43% after 5 days(8,9). In addition, it has been reported that 3,4-dimethylphenol was readily degraded in St. Lawrence River water(10). Biodegradation under anaerobic conditions failed to occur after 24 days from a river sediment inoculum(11).",

Vapor-phase 3,4-dimethylphenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.7 hours(SRC) from its rate constant of 8.14X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Atmospheric 3,4-dimethylphenol is known to be removed by rainwater(4). 3,4-Dimethylphenol has an absorption band at 274 nm (water), and a shoulder may extend over 290 nm, thus making it a candidate for direct photochemical degradation(5,6). Night-time degradation in urban areas should occur rapidly through reaction with atmospheric nitrate radicals, as rate constants for this reaction with phenolic compounds are approximately 250 times faster than with hydroxyl radicals(7,SRC).",

Night-time degradation in urban areas should occur rapidly through reaction with atmospheric nitrate radicals, as rate constants for this reaction with phenolic compounds are approximately 250 times faster than with hydroxyl radicals(4,SRC). Peroxy radicals found in humic waters react with phenols; the half-lives can be measured in hours(5). 3,4-Dimethylphenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

When mixed with a plasticizer, this chemical forms a plastic explosive. It is recognized by the FDA to be a coronary vasodilator in the treatment of heart conditions such as angina.  It is a pentaerythritol nitrate in which all four hydroxy groups of pentaerythritol have been converted to the corresponding nitrate ester. It is a vasodilator with properties that are quite similar to those of glyceryl trinitrate, however, with a more prolonged duration of action. It is also one of the most powerful high explosives known and is a component of the plastic explosive known as Semtex.  PETN has the chemical formula C5H8N4O12. It is formed by reacting pentaerythritol (C5H12O4), an alcohol commonly used in paints and varnishes, with nitric acid (HNO2). The reacting solution is chilled to precipitate the PETN.  It is then filtered out, washed, dried, and recrystallized to produce a colorless crystalline material that is stored and shipped as a mixture with water and alcohol.  Interestingly, this drug was studied for potential benefits in chronic ischemic heart failure patients.  PETN targeting reactive oxygen species generation halted the changes of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes and progressive fibrotic remodeling, leading to amelioration of cardiac functional performance in rats with ischemic heart failure.",

Pentaerythritol tetranitrate releases free nitric oxide (NO) after denitration reaction, which triggers NO-dependent signaling transduction involving soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). NO binds reversibly to the ferrous-heme center of sGC, thereby causes conformational change and activates the enzyme. Activation results in increasing cellular levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) within vascular smooth muscle, which results in vasodilation mediated by cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Furthermore, this agent causes arterial and venous bed dilation in a dose-dependent manner.",

It is also used as a vasodilator drug to treat certain heart conditions, such as for management of angina. PETN works by releasing the signaling gas nitric oxide in the body. The heart medicine Lentonitrat is nearly pure PETN. Monitoring of oral usage of the drug by patients can be performed by determination of plasma levels of several of its hydrolysis products, pentaerythritol dinitrate, pentaerythritol mononitrate and pentaerythritol, in plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Headache and disability to work were self-rated six times per day; individual measurements were combined to total scores. ISMN caused headaches more frequently (in approx. 90% of volunteers) and more severe (average total score 15.2) and a greater disability (average total score 6.0) than the high or low PETN-dosage (both in approx. 50%, headache score 4.9 or 6.4, disability score 1.1 or 2.1, resp.) and placebo (in approx. 10%, headache 0.8, disability 0), all these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon). The high PETN-dosage showed a non-significant trend to produce fewer systemic side effects than the low PETN-dosage (not vice versa). With ISMN six volunteers prematurely terminated the study period and one volunteer who was replaced withdrew from the entire study due to side effects; all volunteers completed the study periods with the other medications.",

Nitrate enters vascular smooth muscle and converted to nitric oxide (NO) which acts as a cellular messenger, leading to activation of cyclic GMP and, therefore, vasodilation.  The nitrovasodilator group of drugs relaxes most smooth muscles in the body, including those in the walls of arteries and veins, and selectively dilate large coronary vessels. Lower doses of nitrates increase coronary blood flow without significantly affecting systemic arterial pressure. Higher doses, especially if repeated frequently, decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as cardiac output, which can result in a headache, weakness, dizziness, and the activation of compensatory sympathetic reflexes, including tachycardia and peripheral arteriolar vasoconstriction.  Smooth muscles in the bronchi, biliary tract, gastrointestinal tract, ureters, and uterus also can be relaxed by nitrovasodilators. PETN seems to be unique among the long-acting nitrovasodilators in that patients do not demonstrate  tolerance to treatment, which results in sustained vasodilation in humans with continuous PETN treatment.  Important to note is that this drug is devoid of induction of oxidative stress and related side-effects such as endothelial dysfunction or tolerance to nitrates. Some of these effects are related to special pharmacokinetics of PETN, but upon chronic administration, PETN also induces antioxidative pathways at the genomic level, resulting in increased expression of heme _oxygenase-1 (HO-1)_ _and ferritin_, both possessing highly protective properties. There is good experimental evidence that at least part of the beneficial profile of long-term treatment with this drug is based on the activation of the _heme oxygenase-1/ferritin_ system.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Pentaerythritol mononitrate shows a six-fold increase in both peak plasma concentrations and area under the 0-12 hour plasma concentration-time curve when PETN is co-administered with a combination of meprobamate, diphenhydramine and nicotinic acid. No such increase is apparent when either meprobamate or diphenhydramine is excluded from the dose. Further increases in pentaerythritol mononitrate plasma levels and AUC 0-12 hr are observed when all of the drugs are administered as the formulated coated tablet (VisanoCor).",

The organic nitrate pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is known to possess antioxidant properties that are thought to be the underlying cause for its specific pharmacological profile. In contrast to other long-acting nitrates, PETN induces tolerance- free vasodilation in humans and was reported to prevent endothelial dysfunction as well as atherogenesis in cholesterol- fed rabbits. ...  The active PETN metabolite PETriN stimulates protein expression of the antioxidant defense protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Additionally, PETriN enhanced the enzymatic activity of HO-1 measured as formation of the HO-1 metabolites bilirubin and carbon monoxide in lysates from endothelial cells. HO-1 induction subsequently led to a marked increase in protein expression of a second antioxidant protein, ferritin, via the HO-1-dependent release of free iron from endogenous heme sources. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with PETriN was followed by increased cellular resistance to oxidant injury mediated by hydrogen peroxide. Endothelial protection by PETriN was mimicked by exogenous bilirubin which led to an almost complete reversal of hydrogen peroxide-induced toxicity. Increased HO-1 and ferritin expression as well as endothelial protection occurred at micromolar concentrations of PETriN which are well within the range of plasma or tissue levels that can be expected during oral therapy. The capacity to protect the endothelium in vitro may translate into and explain the previously observed antiatherogenic actions of PETN in vivo. ... Moreover, in earlier investigations aimed at assessing the antiatherogenic potential of nitrates, PETN but not isosorbide nitrates prevented plaque formation and endothelial dysfunction in animal models of atherosclerosis. Thus, the ability to activate HO-1 induction and associated antioxidant pathways apparently distinguishes PETN from other long-acting nitrates and may explain their different patterns of action in vivo.",

During long-lasting nitrate therapy, except pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), one can observe the development of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the muscular cell of a vessel wall, and these bind with nitric oxide (NO). This leads to decreased NO activity, thus, nitrate tolerance. PETN has no tendency to form ROS, and therefore during long-term PETN therapy, there is probably no tolerance or cross-tolerance, as during treatment with other nitrates.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation. Dataset: the integrated content containing the transformation information. Source: the entity or group that compiled the dataset containing the transformation information.",

Pentaerythritol and HNO3 (ca. 1 : 5.5) are fed into a well-stirred, jacketed reactor, with overflow in cascade into a second reactor of the same design. The temperature is maintained below 30 \u00b0C. PETN precipitates and may be isolated in one of two ways: 1. In a third reactor the reaction mixture is diluted with water to 55 wt % acid and filtered. The PETN is washed with water. 2. The reaction mixture is filtered immediately and then the 82 wt % spent nitric acid is concentrated, a cheaper process but less safe. Washed PETN is stable. It can be recrystallized by dilution of a hot acetone solution with water, which removes traces of acid and some organic impurities, and crystals of desirable size and flow properties for continuous feed purposes are obtained.",

The final rule also authorizes the use of four specific detection agents to mark plastic explosives and provides for the designation of other detection agents. Public Law 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 was enacted on April 24, 1996. Title VI of the Act, \"Implementation of Plastic Explosives Convention,\" added new requirements to the Federal explosives laws in 18 U.S.C. Chapter 40. Section 607 of the Act states that, except as otherwise provided, the amendments made by Title VI shall take effect 1 year after the date of enactment, i.e., on April 24, 1997. The stated purpose of Title VI is to fully implement the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, Done at Montreal on March 1, 1991. The Convention represents an important achievement in international cooperation in response to the threat posed to the safety and security of international civil aviation by virtually undetectable plastic explosives in the hands of terrorists.",

The initial explosion occurred in a room where workers made \"boosters\" - small explosive devices used in the mining industry to detonate larger explosives. A second, more powerful blast destroyed a building used for drying explosives, leaving a 40- by-60-foot crater that was up to six feet deep. The two explosions destroyed buildings, blew down walls, and hurled debris as far as a thousand yards. Of the 11 Sierra employees who were at the site when the accident occurred, only one escaped without injury. The explosions killed all four workers who were in or near Booster Room 2, the production room where the first blast occurred. The explosions had the force of a magnitude 2.0 earthquake and were felt some 20 miles away from the plant. Fearing further blasts, firefighters did not attempt to extinguish fires at the site, and the flames burned for more than a day. Sierra Chemical estimated that in all, 47,000 pounds of explosives were consumed during the accident. The facility was never rebuilt. Although there were no surviving eyewitnesses in Booster Room 2, the CSB used seismic evidence and other techniques to reconstruct what happened on the morning of January 7. Booster Room 2 had housed four large freestanding mixing pots, where explosive materials were melted and blended. The day before the accident a worker had departed early, leaving 50 to 100 pounds of melted base material in the bottom of one of the mixing pots. The base material consisted of TNT and other high explosives. The worker apparently believed that another operator would use the leftover base material later that afternoon. Instead, the material remained in the pot and solidified overnight. The next morning the worker returned to Booster Room 2 ... and without checking its contents he turned on the motor to the agitator blades, setting off the initial explosion. The shock wave from the initial blast detonated several thousand pounds of explosives stored inside the booster room. Heavy debris from this explosion likely rained down onto the PETN drying building 220 feet away, piercing the roof or skylight and initiating an even larger secondary explosion. ... The majority of workers at the Kean Canyon plant spoke only Spanish, but the plant had no operational policies or procedures in that language. ... Workers in both booster rooms used practices that have long been recognized as hazardous at military explosives facilities. Workers regularly used metal tools, including steel hammers and rods, to break up rejected explosive boosters or to clear out pipes and valves that were blocked with explosives - despite the hazard of an accidental detonation. Based on guidelines from the Institute of Makers of Explosives, the two booster rooms should have been located at least 245 to 295 feet from the PETN drying building. The actual distances ranged from 185 to 220 feet. The two booster rooms should have been sited at least 490 feet apart, but the actual distance between them was just 80 feet. The CSB recommended that Sierra Chemical and other explosives manufacturers ensure that their process safety programs include comprehensive hazard analyses, specific written operating procedures, management of change (MOC) procedures, periodic audits, and appropriate safety training and certification for workers and managers. Operating procedures and hazard information should be communicated in languages understood by the workforce.",

At 19:03 Shanwick Oceanic Control transmitted an oceanic clearance. At that time an explosion occurred in the aircraft's forward cargo hold at position 4L. The explosive forces produced a large hole in the fuselage structure and disrupted the main cabin floor. Major cracks continued to propagate from the large hole while containers and items of cargo ejected through the hole, striking the empennage, left- and right tail plane. The forward fuselage and flight deck area separated when the aircraft was in a nose down and left roll attitude, peeling away to the right at Station 800. The nose section then knocked the no. 3 engine off its pylon. The remaining aircraft disintegrated while it was descending nearly vertically from 19000 feet to 9000 feet. A section of cabin floor and baggage hold (from approx. Station 1241-1920) fell onto housing at Rosebank Terrace, Lockerbie. The main wing structure struck the ground with a high yaw angle at Sherwood Crescent, Lockerbie causing a massive fire. The Semtex bomb which caused the explosion had probably been hidden in a radio cassette player and was transferred to PA103 from a Pan Am Boeing 727 flight, arriving from Frankfurt. ...  /All 13 crew members, all 243 passengers, and 11 Lockerbie residents were killed./ PROBABLE CAUSE: \"The in-flight disintegration of the aircraft was caused by the detonation of an improvised explosive device located in a baggage container positioned on the left side of the forward cargo hold at aircraft station 700.\"",

Systolic blood pressure in L-NAME + PETN-treated rats (163 +/- 1 mm Hg) was significantly lower than in L-NAME-treated rats (172 +/- 2 mm Hg) but was still higher than in age-matched controls (126 +/- 2 mm Hg). Six weeks of treatment of rats with L-NAME significantly inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxation of the isolated thoracic aorta induced by acetylcholine. The inhibitory effect of L-NAME was entirely reversed by the simultaneous treatment with PETN. The enhancing effect of L-NAME on noradrenaline-induced contraction was antagonised by long-term treatment with PETN. Wall thickness, cross-sectional area and wall/diameter ratio of the thoracic aorta in L-NAME-treated rats were markedly increased. In the L-NAME + PETN-treated rats, the increment of these parameters was significantly lower. The results suggest that PETN administered to rats during development of NO-deficient hypertension prevented functional impairment and at the same time reduced structural changes in the thoracic aorta induced by long-term inhibition of NO synthase.",

Exchange transfusion and/or the transfusion of packed red blood cells may be useful for methylene blue failures or for patients with known G6PD or NADPH methemoglobin reductase deficiencies. The inherent risks of the large blood volumes required in adults limit the applicability of this method. The usual dose of methylne blue is 1-2 mg/kg (25-50 mg/sq m) of a 1% solution (10 mg/ml) intravenously over 5 minutes. ... The same dose may be repeated within 1 hour if symptoms of hypoxia fail to subside. The administration of ascorbic acid (100-500 mg twice daily either orally or intravenously) is harmless but probably has a minor effect on increasing methemoglobin reduction. /Methemoglobin forming agents/",

Recent data show marked differences in the effects of NTG and PETN on the generation of reactive oxygen species. These differences are attributed to different effects of NTG and PETN on the expression of antioxidative proteins like the heme oxygenase-I. To analyze the expressional effects of NTG and PETN in a more comprehensive manner ... whole genome expression profiling experiments /were performed/ using cardiac total RNA from NTG- or PETN-treated rats and DNA microarrays containing oligonucleotides representing 27,044 rat gene transcripts. The data obtained show that NTG and PETN together significantly modify the expression of >1,600 genes (NTG 532, PETN 1212). However, the expression of only a small group of these genes (68) was modified by both treatments, indicating marked differences in the expressional effects of NTG and PETN. NTG treatment resulted in the enhanced expression of genes that are believed to be markers for cardiotoxic processes. In addition, NTG treatment reduced the expression of genes described to code for cardioprotective proteins. In sharp contrast, PETN treatment enhanced the expression of cardioprotective genes and reduced the expression of genes believed to perform cardiotoxic effects. In conclusion, ... NTG treatment results in the induction of cardiotoxic gene expression networks leading to an activation of mechanisms that result in pathological changes in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, PETN treatment seems to activate gene expression networks that result in cardioprotective effects.",

In the subacute phase of the study, five rats and five mice/sex/group were exposed to 0, 3100, 6200, 12500, 25000 or 50,000 mg PETN, NF/kg diet for 14 days. Based on the data in the study, these concentrations approximated to average daily doses of PETN of 0, 54, 111, 258, 502 and 909 mg/kg-day in male rats, 0, 69, 145, 272, 552 and 1087 mg/kg-day in female rats, 0, 164, 281, 556, 1255 and 2587 mg/kg-day in male mice and 0, 215, 534, 784, 1675 and 3333 mg/kg-day in female mice. However, no clinical signs nor toxicological responses were induced in any of the animals under investigation. The same dietary concentrations of PETN, NF that were used in the 14-day study were administered to 10 rats and mice/sex/group for 13 or 14 weeks, resulting in average daily doses of 0, 43, 90, 203, 319 or 625 mg PETN/kg-day to male rats, 0, 54, 105, 240, 463 or 931 mg/kg-day to female rats, 0, 131, 319, 450, 1028 or 2163 mg/kg-day to male mice and 0, 780, 336, 694, 1406 or 3170 mg/kg-day to female mice... . Few if any overtly PETN-related effects were observed among the responses, although a tendency for higher than normal relative brain and kidney weights was observed in the three high-dose and the highest dose in female rats, respectively. Nitrite was detected sporadically in the urine of some male and female rats, and a Zymbal gland adenoma was detected in a single high-dose female rat. Only female mice exposed to the 50,000 ppm group had lower mean body weights (13%) than controls. No other changes were observed.",

The hypercholesterolemic effects of the cholesterol-spiked diet were marked, although the presence of PETN appeared to significantly reduce the incidence and size of consequent atherosclerotic lesions. Twenty-four hours after the completion of the feeding study, excised cross-sectional pieces of the thoracic aorta were tested for endothelial functional integrity, as indicated by their contractile response to KCl, phenylephrine and by their subsequent vasorelaxant response to acetylcholine, in each case measured by a force-displacement transducer. In general, the different diets induced only marginal effects on the contractile response of the thoracic aorta to KCl or to phenylephrine. However, PETN slightly reduced the vasorelaxing potency of acetylcholine.",

Its use as a medication may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.36X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pentaerythritol tetranitrate will exist partially in the vapor phase and partially in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pentaerythritol tetranitrate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.9 days. Particulate-phase pentaerythritol tetranitrate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Pentaerythritol tetranitrate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pentaerythritol tetranitrate is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 650. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Microbial cultures isolated from soil, river water, and sewage sludge were capable of utilizing pentaerythritol tetranitrate as a sole nitrogen source, suggesting that pentaerythritol tetranitrate may biodegrade in the environment. If released into water, pentaerythritol tetranitrate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 17 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to pentaerythritol tetranitrate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pentaerythritol tetranitrate is produced or used. Use data indicate limited exposure to pentaerythritol tetranitrate may occur via ingestion of drug products containing pentaerythritol tetranitrate. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure of 1.36X10-7 mm Hg(4) and water solubility of 43 mg/L(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 17(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.4(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Microbial cultures isolated from river water and sewage sludge were capable of utilizing pentaerythritol tetranitrate as a sole nitrogen source(9), suggesting that pentaerythritol tetranitrate may biodegrade in the aquatic environment(SRC).",

Vapor-phase pentaerythritol tetranitrate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.9 days, calculated from its rate constant of 1.6X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase pentaerythritol tetranitrate may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). Pentaerythritol tetranitrate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.2X10-9 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates dyrene would exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase dyrene would be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, dyrene is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Dyrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The half-life of dyrene in moist and air dried soil was 0.5 and 2.5 days, respectively which suggests biodegradation is an important fate process. If released into water, dyrene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 93 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important fate process in water and moist soils based upon hydrolysis half-lives of 30 days, 33 days, and 22 hours at pH 4, 7, and 9, respectively. Since dyrene is no longer used as a fungicide in the US, occupational exposure and exposure to the general population is expected to be low. (SRC)",

Furthermore, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4). Volatilization of dyrene from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure, 6.2X10-9 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 8 mg/l(5). Dyrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(5). At 22 \u00b0C, the hydrolytic half-life of dyrene is 30 days, 33 days, and 22 hr at pH 4, 7, and 9, respectively(5), suggesting that hydrolysis will be an important fate process in moist soil(SRC). The half-life of dyrene (100 ppm) in moist and air dried Glouchester loam soil when incubated in sealed jars at 26 \u00b0C was 0.5 and 2.5 days, respectively(6). This data suggests that biodegradation and hydrolysis occur in soils(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure, 6.2X10-9 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 8 mg/l(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 93(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Hydrolysis is expected to be an important fate process in water based upon hydrolytic half-lives of 30 days, 33 days, and 22 hr at pH 4, 7, and 9, respectively(4). Field studies conducted in soils suggest that biodegradation will occur(7), but it is not clear if hydrolysis or biodegradation is the most important degradation pathway and this may be similar in water(SRC).",

Thin-layer chromatography showed that the concn of dyrene in extracts decreased from approximately 30% of that applied on day-0 to 2-3% within 6 days and 1% on day-100(1). During this period, the concn of the main, and only identified, metabolite, dihydoxyanilazine, increased to about 3% of applied radioactivity. Another degradation experiment in which (benzene-U-ring 14C)dyrene and (triazine ring-U-14C)dihydroxyanilizine, the primary degradation product of dyrene, were incubated in an orthic luvisol soil at 22 \u00b0C found that <1% of the applied benzene ring carbon was mineralized and <8% of the triazine ring of dihydroxyanilizine were mineralized after 110 days(2). Mineralization increased only slightly when the incubation temperature was raised to 30 \u00b0C(2). Mineralization was not stimulated when dyrene was applied to the soil several times(2).",

However, in one experiment, little or no mineralization occurred after 110 days(5). Therefore it is not clear to what extent degradation occurs compared with dyrene's being chemically bound to soil components(SRC). The recommended field half-life for dyrene, according to the USDA Pesticides Property Database is 1 day(4). The half-life of dyrene (100 ppm) in moist and air dried Glouchester loam soil (pH 6.4) when incubated in sealed jars at 26 \u00b0C was 0.5 and 2.5 days, respectively(1). Experiments were not conducted using sterile controls to ascertain whether the degradation was microbially induced.",

Hydrolysis is slowest at neutral pH and increases with increasing alkalinity or acidity. Under alkaline conditions, the mechanism involves the direct attack by hydroxyl ions. At 22 \u00b0C, the hydrolytic half-life of dyrene is 30 days, 33 days, and 22 hr at pH 4, 7, and 9, respectively(3). Hydrolysis would also be expected to occur in moist soil.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

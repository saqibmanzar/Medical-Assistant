When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.75 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates sec-butylbenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase sec-butylbenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.9 hours. sec-Butylbenzene is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight, since it does not absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm. If released to soil, sec-butylbenzene is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 7,200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.018 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. sec-Butylbenzene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, sec-butylbenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon sec-butylbenzene's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 4.6 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 660 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Based on a biodegradation screening test, where sec-butylbenzene was found to degrade 56-67% after 5 days when incubated at 25 \u00b0C with activated sludge, sec-butylbenzene may biodegrade in soil and in aquatic environments. Occupational exposure to sec-butylbenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where sec-butylbenzene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to sec-butylbenzene via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of food and water. (SRC)",

Volatilization of sec-butylbenzene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.018 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 1.75 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 17.6 mg/L(5). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). The potential for volatilization of sec-butylbenzene from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure(4). Based on an aquatic biodegradation screening test, where sec-butylbenzene was found to degrade 56-67% after 5 days when incubated at 25 \u00b0C with activated sludge(6), sec-butylbenzene may biodegrade in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.018 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 1.75 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 17.6 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 4.6 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 88 days if adsorption is considered (6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 660(SRC), from its log Kow of 4.57(2) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). Based on an aquatic biodegradation screening test, where sec-butylbenzene was found to degrade 56-67% after 5 days when incubated at 25 \u00b0C with activated sludge(9), sec-butylbenzene may biodegrade in aquatic environments(SRC). sec-Butylbenzene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(10).",

The mixed autochthonous flora in clean groundwater as an inoculum were capable to using the compounds in the water-soluble fraction of gas oil, including sec-butylbenzene, as the only carbon source(2). After 8 days of continuous percolation at 60 mL/hr no hydrocarbons were detectable by gas chromatography(2). In a Warburg test, sec-butylbenzene (500 ppm) reached 1.4-51.8% of its theoretical BOD in 6-192 hours at 20 \u00b0C and pH 7, using activated sludge that was acclimated to benzene(3). sec-Butylbenzene (500 mg/L) was found to reach 5.3% of it theoretical BOD after 24 hours in a Warburg test using sludge from a municipal plants in Ohio during Warburg tests(4). sec-Butylbenzene was slightly oxidized by a second sludge and was toxic to a third sludge from 2 other Ohio municipal plants(4). sec-Butylbenzene (500 mg/L) reached 32% of its theoretical BOD after 7.5 days in a Warburg test using activated sludge acclimated to aniline(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Nine urban studies of shallow groundwater carried out as part of the US Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program; sec-butylbenzene was detected in fewer than 5% of the wells(3). Groundwater samples from existing wells at 30 industrial sites in Taiwan (8 chemical and petrochemical industrial districts, 2 technology industrial parks, 11 general industrial districts, 2 metal processing areas, 2 oil refinery plants, 1 pesticide manufacturing plant, and 4 landfills) were monitored for 60 volatile organic chemicals; sec-butylbenzene was detected, along with 7 other organic chemicals, with a frequency of approximately 2.5% of 214 samples(4). Groundwater samples were collected as part of the National Water-Quality Assessment Program of the US Geological Service from 2,948 well from around the US in 1985-1995; sec-butylbenzene was detected in wells in urban areas (n=406) and rural areas (n=2,542) with a frequency and range of 1.9% and approximately 1-10 ug/L, and 0.1% and approximately 0.2-5 ug/L, respectively(5). sec-Butylbenzene was not detected in groundwater from 2 wells sampled in 1978 and in 1983 down gradient from a sewage treatment plant at Ft. Devens, an army military camp about 32 miles northwest of Boston, MA(6,7). sec-Butylbenzene was detected at 0.57 ug/L in 1 groundwater sample from the Orange County Landfill in Orlando, FL collected in 1992-1993; it was not detected in 3 other samples at this site(8).",

Concns of sec-butylbenzene ranged from 0-3 ppb volume in morning air from Los Angeles, CA samples from September-November 1981(2). Combined sec-butylbenzene and iso-butylbenzene concns ranged from 0.002 to 0.012 ppb volume in ambient air in the Los Angeles basin(3). The mean ambient urban concn of sec-butylbenzene combined with 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene in Porto Alegre, Brazil, March 20, 1996 to April 16, 1997 was 7.9 mg/cu m; further analysis indicated that sec-butylbenzene accounted for <1% of the unresolved peak with 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene(4). sec-Butylbenzene was detected in the air in the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1979(5). sec-Butylbenzene was identified in the air samples collected in Paris, France in the fall of 1972(6). According to a national survey of ambient air, which included five site types (remote, rural, suburban, urban, and source dominated) the average daily atmospheric concns of sec-butylbenzene was 0.033 and 0.049 ppb volume for 137 suburban and 279 urban samples, respectively(7).",

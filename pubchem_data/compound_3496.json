Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Serial blood samples were obtained after i.v. and oral administration. Plasma concentrations of glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) were determined by HPLC method. After i.v. and oral administration, plasma concentration-time curves were best described by a two-compartment open model. For glyphosate, the elimination half-lives (T(1/2beta)) from plasma were 9.99 hr after i.v. and 14.38 hr after oral administration. The total plasma clearance was not influenced by dose concentration or route and reached a value of 0.995 L/hr/kg. After i.v. administration, the apparent volume of distribution in the second compartment (V(2)) and volume of distribution at steady state (V(ss)) were 2.39 and 2.99 L/kg, respectively, suggesting a considerable diffusion of the herbicide into tissues. After oral administration, glyphosate was partially and slowly absorbed with a T(max) of 5.16 hr. The oral bioavailability of glyphosate was found to be 23.21%. Glyphosate was converted to AMPA. The metabolite AMPA represented 6.49% of the parent drug plasma concentrations. The maximum plasma concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA were 4.62 and 0.416 microg/mL, respectively. The maximum plasma concentration of AMPA was achieved at 2.42 hr. For AMPA, the elimination half-life (T(1/2beta)) was 15.08 hr after oral administration of glyphosate parent compound.",

Therefore, the mechanism of glyphosate-induced neurotoxic effects needs to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Roundup (a glyphosate-based herbicide) leads to neurotoxicity in hippocampus of immature rats following acute (30min) and chronic (pregnancy and lactation) pesticide exposure. Maternal exposure to pesticide was undertaken by treating dams orally with 1% Roundup (0.38% glyphosate) during pregnancy and lactation (till 15-day-old). Hippocampal slices from 15 day old rats were acutely exposed to Roundup (0.00005-0.1%) during 30min and experiments were carried out to determine whether glyphosate affects (45)Ca(2+) influx and cell viability. Moreover, /this study/ investigated the pesticide effects on oxidative stress parameters, (14)C-alpha-methyl-amino-isobutyric acid ((14)C-MeAIB) accumulation, as well as glutamate uptake, release and metabolism. Results showed that acute exposure to Roundup (30min) increases (45)Ca(2+) influx by activating NMDA receptors and voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, leading to oxidative stress and neural cell death. The mechanisms underlying Roundup-induced neurotoxicity also involve the activation of CaMKII and ERK. Moreover, acute exposure to Roundup increased (3)H-glutamate released into the synaptic cleft, decreased GSH content and increased the lipoperoxidation, characterizing excitotoxicity and oxidative damage. /This study/ also observed that both acute and chronic exposure to Roundup decreased (3)H-glutamate uptake and metabolism, while induced (45)Ca(2+) uptake and (14)C-MeAIB accumulation in immature rat hippocampus. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Roundup might lead to excessive extracellular glutamate levels and consequently to glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress in rat hippocampus.",

The present results show that acute Roundup exposure at low doses (36 ppm, 0.036 g/L) for 30 min induces oxidative stress and activates multiple stress-response pathways leading to Sertoli cell death in prepubertal rat testis. The pesticide increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration by opening L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels as well as endoplasmic reticulum IP3 and ryanodine receptors, leading to Ca(2+) overload within the cells, which set off oxidative stress and necrotic cell death. Similarly, 30 min incubation of testis with glyphosate alone (36 ppm) also increased (45)Ca(2+) uptake. These events were prevented by the antioxidants Trolox and ascorbic acid. Activated protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases such as ERK1/2 and p38MAPK play a role in eliciting Ca(2+) influx and cell death. Roundup decreased the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and increased the amounts of thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS) and protein carbonyls. Also, exposure to glyphosate-Roundup stimulated the activity of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, supporting downregulated GSH levels. Glyphosate has been described as an endocrine disruptor affecting the male reproductive system; however, the molecular basis of its toxicity remains to be clarified. We propose that Roundup toxicity, implicated in Ca(2+) overload, cell signaling misregulation, stress response of the endoplasmic reticulum, and/or depleted antioxidant defenses, could contribute to Sertoli cell disruption in spermatogenesis that could have an impact on male fertility.",

Previous studies indicated that the exposure to glyphosate, a widely used herbicide, is possibly linked to Parkinsonism, however the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the neurotoxic effects of glyphosate in differentiated PC12 /rat/ cells and discovered that it inhibited viability of differentiated PC12 cells in dose-and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, the results showed that glyphosate induced cell death via autophagy pathways in addition to activating apoptotic pathways. Interestingly, deactivation of Beclin-1 gene attenuated both apoptosis and autophagy in glyphosate treated differentiated PC12 cells, suggesting that Beclin-1 gene is involved in the crosstalk between the two mechanisms.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Although the Agency has found that all uses of glyphosate (isopropylamine and sodium salt formulations) are eligible for reregistration, it should be understood that the Agency may take appropriate regulatory action, and/or require the submission of additional data to support the registration of products containing glyphosate, if new information comes to the Agency's attention or if the data requirements for registration (or the guidelines for generating such data) change. ... Based on the reviews of the generic data for the active ingredient glyphosate, the Agency has sufficient information on the health effects of glyphosate and on its potential for causing adverse effects in fish and wildlife and the environment. The Agency concludes that products containing glyphosate for all uses are eligible for reregistration. The Agency has determined that glyphosate products, labeled and used as specified in this Reregistration Eligibility Document, will not pose unreasonable risks or adverse effects to humans or the environment.",

Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide registered for use on many food and non-food field crops as well as non-crop areas where total vegetation control is desired. When applied at lower rates, glyphosate is also a plant growth regulator.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Glyphosate is an active ingredient of the most widely used herbicide and it is believed to be less toxic than other pesticides. However, several studies showed its potential adverse health effects to humans as it may be an endocrine disruptor. Concentrated solutions of glyphosate can also cause dermal irritation. Most intoxicated cases are from ingestion, inhalation, and skin exposure. Pulmonary edema, shock, and arrhythmia were the reported causes of mortality. Ingestion of glyphosate-surfactant herbicides can result in acute kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities, acidosis, cardiovascular collapse, and death. In severe toxicity, the use of hemodialysis is reported, but largely unsupported by kinetic analysis. Commercial formulations were more cytotoxic than the active component alone, supporting the concept that additives in commercial formulations play a role in the toxicity attributed to glyphosate-based herbicides. Glyphosate was found nongenotoxic in human lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation. However it induced micronuclei formation and DNA damage in a buccal epithelial cell line (TR146). In addition, glyphosate was toxic to human placental JEG3 cells. ANIMAL STUDIES: Glyphosate did not produce dermal sensitization in guinea pigs. It produced moderate to severe eye irritation in rabbits. In a 13-week study with glyphosate administration, lesions of the salivary glands were found in rats and mice. A study in a 2-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis model and proteomic analysis suggested that glyphosate has tumor promoting potential in skin carcinogenesis. Studies in rats and rabbits indicated that technical glyphosate is not teratogenic. In the first /multigenerational/ study,  the only effect noted was an increased incidence of unilateral renal tubular dilation in F3b male pups at 30 mg/kg body weight. Maternal exposure to glyphosate disturbed the masculinization process in the offsping and promoted behavioral changes and histological and endocrine problems in reproductive parameters. These changes associated with the hypersecretion of androgens increased gonadal activity and sperm production. The entire body of the developmental toxicity data reviewed fails to support a potential risk for increased cardiovascular defects as a result of glyphosate exposure during pregnancy. A broad array of in vitro and in vivo assays has consistently demonstrated that glyphosate and glyphosate-containing herbicide formulations are not genotoxic. Occasionally, however, related and contradictory data are reported, including findings of mouse liver and kidney DNA adducts and damage following intraperitoneal (ip) injection. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Gene expression data (mRNA levels) suggests that glyphosate-based herbicides have the potential to alter hormonal pathways during tadpole development. Roundup exposure had negative impact on the immune system of European sea bass. Roundup at environmentally relevant concentrations has lethal and genotoxic impact on the Indian skittering frog. Roundup also altered normal histology of the studied organs and caused a significant decrease in the number of copulations and mating success in male fish exposed to the herbicide in the neotropical native fish, Jenynsia multidentata.",

For the herbicide glyphosate, there was limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The evidence in humans is from studies of exposures, mostly agricultural, in the USA, Canada, and Sweden published since 2001. In addition, there is convincing evidence that glyphosate also can cause cancer in laboratory animals. On the basis of tumours in mice, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) originally classified glyphosate as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group C) in 1985. After a re-evaluation of that mouse study, the US EPA changed its classification to evidence of non-carcinogenicity in humans (Group E) in 1991. The US EPA Scientific Advisory Panel noted that the re-evaluated glyphosate results were still significant using two statistical tests recommended in the IARC Preamble. The IARC Working Group that conducted the evaluation considered the significant findings from the US EPA report and several more recent positive results in concluding that there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Glyphosate also caused DNA and chromosomal damage in human cells, although it gave negative results in tests using bacteria. One study in community residents reported increases in blood markers of chromosomal damage (micronuclei) after glyphosate formulations were sprayed nearby.",

The cytotoxicity of TN-20 and LN-10 (0.4-100 uM), in the presence or absence of glyphosate was determined by assessing membrane integrity. TN-20 toxicity was significantly lower in the presence of 50 uM glyphosate for the fibroblast-like cell (6.25 uM; 3.9% +/- 3.4% vs -4.8%+/-0.7%), for the alveolar cells (0.78 uM; 5.7% +/- 0.9% vs 0.1% +/- 0.6%), and for the heart cell line (25.0 uM; 7.9% +/-3.0% vs 19.4% +/- 0.7%) compared to that of TN-20 alone. The cellular toxicity of LN-10 towards the fibroblast-like cells was found to be increased in the presence of 50 uM glyphosate when LN-10 concentrations of 50 uM (31.3% +/- 3.9% vs 19.2% +/-0.9%) and 100 uM (62.1% +/- 3.4% vs 39.0% +/- 0.7%) were compared to that of LN-10 alone.

However, this chemical, when combined with a surfactant, is cytotoxic. In this study, the mechanism of the additive effect of glyphosate and TN-20, a common surfactant in glyphosate herbicides, was investigated. After exposure of rat H9c2 cells to glyphosate and TN-20 mixtures, following assays were performed: flow cytometry to determine the proportion of cells that underwent apoptosis and necrosis; western blotting to determine expression of mitochondrial proteins (Bcl-2 and Bax); immunological methods to evaluate translocation of cytochrome C; luminometric measurements to determine activity of caspases 3/7 and 9; and tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester assay to measure mitochondrial membrane potentials. Bcl-1 intensity decreased while Bax intensity increased with exposure to increasing TN-20 and/or glyphosate concentrations. Caspase activity increased and mitochondrial membrane potential decreased only when the cells were exposed to a mixture of both TN-20 and glyphosate, but not after exposure to either one of these compounds. The results support the possibility that mixtures of glyphosate and TN-20 aggravate mitochondrial damage and induce apoptosis and necrosis. Throughout this process, TN-20 seems to disrupt the integrity of the cellular barrier to glyphosate uptake, promoting glyphosate-mediated toxicity.",

METHODS: This study enrolled 64 glyphosate-intoxicated patients with allocation to two groups: those treated with ILE (ILE group, n = 22), and control patients treated with only supportive (conservative) care. Control patients were selected by matching for the amount ingested and time since ingestion. Twenty-two control patients were separately selected from the 42 patients receiving supportive care only. In ILE group, 20% lipid emulsion product was injected intravenously ... for the patients who ingested less than 100 mL of glyphosate. In the patients who ingested more than 100 mL of glyphosate, the loading dose was ... according to the status of the patients, followed by a maintenance dose ... for the next 24 hr. RESULTS: Thirteen patients received high dose of ILE because the ingestion amount was more than 100 ml. None of the ILE group suffered from the complication of hypotension, while approximately 41% of the control group developed the complication. Additionally, arrhythmia was not observed in the ILE group. The incidence of mental change, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury was similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: ILE administration was associated with lower incidence of hypotension and arrhythmia in patients with acute glyphosate intoxication. ILE administration seems to be an effective treatment modality in patients who ingested sufficient amount of glyphosate herbicide that is expected to bring about significant toxicity.",

Most intoxicated cases are from ingestion, inhalation, and skin exposure. Intramuscular injection of GlySH has never been reported. /This study presents/ a case of GlySH intoxication via intramuscular injection. CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old woman came to the emergency department complaining of painful swelling of left upper limb for 12 hr. She had performed an intramuscular injection of 6 mL of GlySH over the lateral aspect of the left elbow 15 h previously. Physical examination disclosed painful swelling over left distal arm, elbow, and forearm with three needle punctures. CT scan revealed ill-defined areas of heterogeneous high density with marked swelling at subcutaneous tissue over posterior aspect of the elbow. DISCUSSION: The mechanism of toxicity of GlySH is complicated and surfactant was thought to play an important role in GlySH intoxication. Intramuscular GlySH poisoning is different from oral GlySH intoxication. Care should be taken when monitoring acute rhabdomyolysis and compartment syndrome, which may develop rapidly and contribute to the surfactant component of glyphosate formulation.",

The aim of the present work was to investigate if the pesticide-induced OS was able to affect brain and liver cell survival. The treatment of Wistar rats with the pesticides (i.p. 1/250 LD50, three times a week for 5 weeks) caused loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cardiolipin content, especially in substantia nigra (SN), with a concomitant increase of fatty acid peroxidation. The activation of calpain apoptotic cascade (instead of the caspase-dependent pathway) would be responsible for the DNA fragmentation pattern observed. Thus, these results may contribute to understand the effect(s) of chronic and simultaneous exposure to pesticides on cell survival.",

The salivary glands lesions induced by glyphosate were similar to those which could be induced by exposure to high subcutaneous doses of the /nonselective/ beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and could be partially ameliorated with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propanolol. This indicates that glyphosate may induce the salivary gland lesions by acting as a weak adrenergic agonist.",

Serum bile acid concentrations and alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities were significantly increased. One mouse treated with 50,000 ppm died. The major pathological change induced by glyphosate was a dose related increase in basophilic changes and hypertrophy of acinar cells (cytoplasmic alterations) in the parotid and submandibular salivary glands of rats and the parotid salivary glands in mice.

Cosmo-Flux was added to Glyphos in the proportion of 2.3% v/v, as used in aerial application for coca control. Exposures were for 96 hr at 23 +/- 1.5 degrees C with 12:12-hr light/dark cycle. Test solutions were renewed every 24 hr. Concentrations, measured within the first hour and at 24 and 96 hr using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Abraxis, LLC), ranged from 70 to 130% of nominal values. LC50 values ranged from 1200 to 2780 ug glyphosate acid equivalents (a.e.)/L for the 8 species tested. Data suggest that sensitivity to Roundup-type formulations of glyphosate in these species is similar to that observed in other tropical and temperate species. In addition, sensitivity of larval amphibians to Roundup-type formulations spans a relatively narrow range. Finally, toxicity of the mixture as used to spray coca was likely driven by the surfactant in the glyphosate formulation, as the addition of Cosmo-Flux did not enhance toxicity above those reported for Vision = Roundup. /Formulation/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.8X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates glyphosate will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase glyphosate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Glyphosate does not degrade by direct photolysis. If released to soil, glyphosate is expected to have slight mobility based upon a Koc range of 2,600 to 4,900. The pKa values of glyphosate are 2.0, 2.6, 5.6 and 10.6, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the zwitterion form in the environment and zwitterions generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an ion and ions do not volatilize. Glyphosate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation half-lives in soil of 1.85 to 7 days under aerobic conditions indicate that biodegrdation is an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, glyphosate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc range. The aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation half-life of glyphosate in a flooded silty clay loam sediment was 7 and 8.1 days, respectively, suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in sediment. Biodegradation data in water were not available. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because glyphosate exists as a zwitterion in water and ionic species do not volatilize. A BCF of 0.52 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Glyphosate is stable to hydrolysis at pH 5, 7, and 9 at temperatures ranging from 5 to 35 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to glyphosate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where glyphosate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to glyphosate via ingestion of drinking water and dermal contact with consumer products containing glyphosate. The greatest potential for dermal and inhalation exposure to glyphosate is expected for pesticide applicators, farm workers, and members of the general population that have frequent contact with products containing glyphosate for commercial farming or home use.

In addition to binding to organic matter and clay in soil, it may also form insoluble complexes with metal ions in the soil. Distribution data for glyphosate after spraying in a coastal forest ecosystem indicate that glyphosate is strongly adsorbed to the upper layers of soil and has a low propensity for leaching(2). Glyphosate residues dissipated with a half-life of 45-60 days. After 360 days, residues levels were 6-18% of initial levels(2). Field studies on eleven different soils covering a full range of soil types and geographical areas indicates an avg half-life of 60 days for glyphosate in soil(4). Other sources also report an avg half-life of 60 days from literature surveys(1,5).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

After 28 days under aerobic conditions, 45-55% of the glyphosate was mineralized using Ray silt loam soil, Lintonia sandy loam soil, and Drummer silty clay loam soil. Norfolk sandy loam mineralized glyphosate at a much slower, but still significant, rate. In greenhouse experiments, the half-lives of glyphosate in Ray, Drummer and Norfolk soil was 3, 27, and 130 days, respectively(2). The biodegradation half-life of glyphosate in a Kickapoo sandy loam and Dupo silt loam soil were 1.85 and 2.06 days, respectively, under aerobic conditions. The major degradation product observed was aminomethyl phosphonic acid. The aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation half-life of glyphosate in a flooded silty clay loam sediment was 7 and 8.1 days, respectively(3).",

CO2 release did not occur in sterilized soil. The addition of phosphate, which competes with glyphosate for soil binding sites, increased the rate of CO2 release, although both bound and free glyphosate were degraded(2). The pattern of biodegradation suggests that glyphosate does not support microbial growth, but is co-metabolized(2). Glyphosate's only significant metabolite is aminomethylphosphosphonic acid (AMPA), which also rapidly degrades in soil(1,3). When radiolabeled glyphosate was incubated in three Saskatchewan soils, 50% of the herbicide was mineralized in 30-40 days; the half-life of glyphosate, itself, would be shorter(4). After 90 days when 69-75% of radioactivity had been released, 7-16% of the activity was in a solvent-extractable fraction and 7-14% was in a non-extractable fraction.",

The nitrogen atom is positively charged and both the carboxylic acid group and phosphonic acid group are deprotonated; above pH 5.6 the latter is predominantly doubly ionized and below pH 5.6 it is singly ionized(1). Glyphosate has three groups (amine, carboxylate and phosphonate) that may coordinate strongly as tridentate or tetradentate ligands with transition metal and alkaline earth ions(3). It has been demonstrated that insoluble complexes are formed between glyphosate and ferric, cupric, calcium, and magnesium ions at near neutral pH. Ferrous salts are oxidized to the ferric salt yielding the ferric-glyphosate complex. Since groundwater may contain high concentrations of iron, calcium, and magnesium, glyphosate would form insoluble complexes with these ions and precipitate out.

The photolytic half-life of glyphosate in deionized water exposed outdoors to sunlight was approximately 5 wk at 100 ppm and 3 wk at 2000 ppm(3). The degradation product was aminomethylphosphonic acid. In contrast, no degradation occurred when exposed to light equivalent of 16 eight hour days of sunlight in a photoreactor(2).

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a suggested classification scheme(2), these Koc values indicates that glyphosate is expected to have slight mobility in soil(SRC). Glyphosate exists in zwitterion form in the environment and interactions with soil and sediment are primarily ionic, rather than hydrophobic(3). Soil factors such as clay mineral type and content, organic matter content, soil pH, and cation exchange capacity have major effects on adsorption. It has been shown that adsorption of glyphosate on variable-charge, volcanic ash-derived soils in Chile strongly increased when pH decreased(4). The Freundlich soil adsorption coefficient (Kf) Houston clay loam, Muskingum silt loam, and Sassafras sandy loam were 76, 56, and 33, respectively. The adsorptivity correlated with clay content, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pH(1). Decreasing adsorption to five clays with increasing pH is due to decreased interaction as the clay surface and glyphosate become more negatively charged(5). Another investigator found that the extractability of glyphosate from soil and various clay minerals increased with pH, but the degree of adsorption did not correlate with CEC or surface area of the sorbent, indicating that adsorption to clays was via a specific sorption mechanism, rather than a general one and that the mechanism is H-bonding and ion exchange(6).",

Occupational workers and home gardeners may be exposed to glyphosate by inhalation and dermal contact during spraying, mixing, and cleanup. They may also be exposed by touching soil and plants to which glyphosate was applied. Dermal exposure may also occur during glyphosate's manufacture, transport, storage, and disposal. In a 1987 California survey of pesticide-related occupational exposures, exposures to glyphosate were (work activity, number exposed): ground applicator, ground, 13; applicator hand-held, 8; applicator, other, 1; coincidental exposure, 4; mixer/loader, ground application, 4(1). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to glyphosate via ingestion of drinking water and dermal contact with consumer products containing glyphosate(SRC).",

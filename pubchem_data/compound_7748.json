When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.37 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl 2-bromoacetate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl 2-bromoacetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days. If released to soil, ethyl 2-bromoacetate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 12. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.70X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyl 2-bromoacetate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, ethyl 2-bromoacetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 17 hr and 12 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to ethyl 2-bromoacetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl 2-bromoacetate is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

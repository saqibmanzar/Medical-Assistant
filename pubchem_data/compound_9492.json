ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The liver, kidney and small intestine demonstrated particularly high levels of activity when compounds such as 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (56575), 5-nitrofurfural-diacetal and o-dinitrobenzene (99650) were used as substrates. Fifty-two nitro compounds, including 19 nitrofuran derivatives, were also used to test the nitrite releasing activity of the major enzyme purified from rhesus-monkey. The purified enzyme showed activity only toward o-dinitrobenzene, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, 3,4-dinitrobenzoic-acid (528450), p-dinitrobenzene (100254), 2,5-dinitrobenzoic-acid (610286), 2,5-dinitrophenol (329715), tetra-chloronitrobenzene, and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic-acid (610300) of the 33 nitro compounds other than nitrofuran derivatives which were tested as substrates.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Phenols do not behave as organic alcohols, as one might guess from the presence of a hydroxyl (-OH) group in their structure. Instead, they react as weak organic acids. Phenols and cresols are much weaker as acids than common carboxylic acids (phenol has pKa = 9.88). These materials are incompatible with strong reducing substances such as hydrides, nitrides, alkali metals, and sulfides. Flammable gas (H2) is often generated, and the heat of the reaction may ignite the gas. Heat is also generated by the acid-base reaction between phenols and bases.",

Exposure can cause a bluish color to skin and lips, headaches, temperature rise, dizziness, collapse, convulsions, coma, and even death. Exposure may irritate the lungs, causing caoughing and shortness of breath. Higher levels can cause a build up of fluid in the lungs, a medical emergency which can cause death. Long Term Exposure: Repeated or prolonged contact with skin may cause dermatitis with rash and drying and itching of the skin. Dinitrophenol may have effects on the dyes, causing cataracts. Exposure can damage the liver and kidneys, and affect the thyroid gland. May cause lung irritation and the development of bronchitis with coughing and shortness of breath. May damage the nervous system. High exposure may damage the developing fetus.",

The nitrite-releasing activity of the major enzyme purified from rhesus monkey liver was tested on fifty-two nitro compounds including nineteen nitrofuran derivatives. Among the thirty-three nitro compounds other than the nitrofuran derivatives tested as substrates, the purified enzyme showed activity only toward o-dinitrobenzene, 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide, 3,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, p-dinitrobenzene, 2,5-dinitrobenzoic acid, 2,5-dinitrophenol, tetra-chloronitrobenzene and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid. The crude supernatant fraction of rhesus monkey liver showed activity in substrate specificity roughly similar to that of the purified enzyme. On the other hand, among at least ten carcinogenic 2-substituted 5-nitrofran derivatives tested, 4,6-diamino-2-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-s-triazine, 5-nitro-2-furaldehyde semicarbazone, N-[[3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]methyl] acetamide, and N-[5-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-1-3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)acetamide were shown to be enzymatically conjugated with reduced glutathione. Among the other nine 2-substituted 5-nitrofuran derivatives tested, six compounds could be the substrates of the enzyme, and 5-nitrofurfural and 5-nitrofurfural diacetal were especially good substrates. There was, however, little apparent correlation between their carcinogenicity and susceptibility to glutathione S-transferase. The bulky substituents at position 2 appeared to decrease the susceptibility of these nitrofuran derivatives to the enzyme. Both Vmax and Km values of the purified enzyme varied greatly among the substrates, and the optimum pH fell between 7.5 and 9.0 in most cases.",

ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP had no such effect. Thymine and thymidine were inactive. ATP and thymidine together caused cytokinesis in multinucleated cells.

Test data on up to 8 species of freshwater fishers were available per cmpd. Overall, the experimental toxicity data on these chem were consistent with the QSAR predictions. The 110 phenols occupy a considerably larger range of spanned substituent space than the QSAR training set. One cmpd, 4-aminophenol exhibited lethality at test concn of 35 times below that predicted. The increased fish toxicity of this cmpd is explained in terms of a proelectrophilic mol mechanism, in which the parent cmpd is metabolically oxidized to a para quinoid structure. The resulting electrophilic metabolite is susceptible to attack by nucleophilic moieties present in biological macromols leading to covalent bond formation and inhibition of biochem processes.",

Log P was the more important parameter and exhibited a good correlation with log (1/LC50) at all pH levels. The contribution of DELTApKa when introduced as a 2nd parameter into the regression equation was dependent on the pH of water: at pH 6, it was pos but turned neg as the pH was raised to 8. If the LC50 were correlated for ionization using an empirically formulated relation between toxicity and pH, the resulting regression equation could be used to predict the toxicity at any pH from 6 to 8. When corrected for ionization, log BCF (the bioconcn factor) of 8 phenols was highly correlated with log P but not with DELTApKa. The regression of log BCF on log P sufficed to explain the regression of toxicity on lipophilicity.",

The solution temperatures were maintained at about 10.8 and 11.8 \u00b0C for the spring and autumn spawners, respectively. The effects of the DNP concentrations on the embryonic development were determined by measuring the activity of the embryo, the heartbeat rate and the mutagenic and mortality rates. The rate of mortality was shown to be dependent on the age of the embryo at the start of exposure and on the concentration of the DNP. Exposure at 30 and 48 hr resulted in 100% mortality at 0.025 and 0.03 mM/l, respectively. When the embryos were first exposed at 55 hr, highest concentration (0.10 mM DNP/l) produced 92.6% mortality. DNP also increased the occurrence of malformations which were in the form of anophthalmy, symmetrical and unilateral microphthalmy, curled bodies and dedifferentiations.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.22X10-4 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates 2,5-dinitrophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,5-dinitrophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 32 days. 2,5-Dinitrophenol may react with nitrate radicals in the atmosphere. 2,5-Dinitrophenol absorbs light at wavelengths of 361 nm in water and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,5-dinitrophenol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 460. The pKa of 2,5-dinitrophenol is 5.21, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because 2,4-dinitrophenol exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. No biodegradation was observed when 2,5-dinitrophenol was incubated with an anaerobic digester sludge over a 90 day period. 2,5-Dinitrophenol was stable to biochemical degradation by a mixed culture of phenol-adapted bacteria under aerobic conditions. If released into water, 2,5-dinitrophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon 2,5-dinitrophenols pKa. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2,5-dinitrophenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,5-dinitrophenol is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,5-dinitrophenol via dermal contact with products containing 2,5-dinitrophenol. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 2,5-dinitrophenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 32 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 2,5-Dinitrophenol may react with nitrate radicals in the atmosphere(2). 2,5-Dinitrophenol absorbs light at wavelengths of 361 nm in water(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

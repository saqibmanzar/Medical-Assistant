If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to the atmosphere, 2-methyl-1-pentanol will exist mainly in the vapor phase based on an experimental vapor pressure of 1.92 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 2-methyl-1-pentanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 1.3 days. 2-Methyl-1-pentanol is expected to have very high mobility in soil based on an estimated Koc value of 37. With a water solubility of 6000 mg/L, this compound, under some environmental conditions, may leach in soil. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces may occur. Limited data indicate that 2-methyl-1-pentanol may readily biodegrade in both soil and water. 2-Methyl-1-pentanol, at 2.0 mg of carbon/L, was inoculated with domestic sewage; 18, 55, 62, 54% of the theoretical BOD was reached by day 2, 5, 20, and 30, respectively. 2-Methyl-1-pentanol may volatilize from water surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 and 10 days, respectively. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is not expected based on an estimated BCF value of 5. Exposure to 2-methyl-1-pentanol may occur occupationally during its production or use in the manufacture of other products. (SRC)",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

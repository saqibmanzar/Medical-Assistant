When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Therefore, no mitigation measures are needed, and the exemption from the requirement of tolerances established in 40 CFR 180.1067 for residues of methyl eugenol on raw agricultural commodities are now considered reassessed under section 408(q) of the FFDCA.[Available from, as of July 27, 2005: http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/status.htm]",

A marginal increase in the incidence of squamous cell neoplasms of the forestomach may have been related to methyleugenol administration in female rats. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of methyleugenol in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on the increased incidences of liver neoplasms. Neuroendocrine tumors of the glandular stomach in male mice were also considered related to methyleugenol administration.",

Stop-exposure groups of 60 male and 60 female F344/N rats received 300 mg/kg in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage for 52 week followed by just the 0.5% methylcellulose vehicle for the remaining 53 week of the study. ... 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice received methyleugenol in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage at doses of 0, 37, 75 or 150 mg/kg for 105 week. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2 yr gavage studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of methyleugenol in male and female F344/N rats based on the increase incidences of liver neoplasms and neuroendocrine tumors of the glandular stomach in male and female rats and the increase incidences of kidney neoplams, malignant mesothelioma, mammary gland fibroadenoma, subcutaneous fibroma and fibroma or fibrosarcoma (combined) in male rats. A marginal increase in the incidence of squamous cell neoplasms of the forestomach may have been related to methyleugenol admin in female rats. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of methyleugenol in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on the increase incidences of liver neoplasms. Neuroendocrine tumors of the glandular stomach in male mice were also considered related to methyleugenol admin.",

Methyleugenol was identified as a volatile flavor compound in the juice of Kogyoku apples and occurs as a component of rose oil and pimento oil. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.012 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyleugenol will exist almost entirely as a vapor. Vapor-phase methyleugenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours. If released to soil, methyleugenol is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 140. A theoretical BOD of 86-91% in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum and the Japanese MITI test indicates that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Dissipation half-lives of 6 and 16 hours in soil at 32 and 22 \u00b0C, respectively, have been reported. Methyleugenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, methyleugenol is expected to adsorb moderately to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9 days and 69 days, respectively. Dissipation half-lives of 6 and 34 hours in water at 32 and 22 \u00b0C, respectively, have been reported. An estimated BCF of 18 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to methyleugenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where eugenol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methyleugenol via ingestion of food containing methyleugenol and inhalation and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing methyleugenol.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.012 mm Hg(4), and water solubility(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9 and 69 days, respectively(SRC). Dissipation half-lives of 6 and 34 hours in water at 32 and 22 \u00b0C, respectively, have been measured(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 18(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A theoretical BOD of 86-91% in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum and the Japanese MITI test(7) indicates that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It is converted to trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in mice, but not much in rats. TCA acts as a peroxisome proliferator, and the neoplasm in the liver of mice may arise through this mechanism. These chemicals are conjugated with GSH, yielding products that are converted to the reactive metabolites in the kidneys through the action of beta-lyase. These steps occur to a greater extent in rats than in mice, and account for the pronounced nephrotoxicity, involving alpha-2-microglobin accumulation, probably a key reaction. The nephrotoxicity explains the low but definite yield of kidney neoplasms.",

Examples of catalysts that have been used are iron and copper compounds, which are precipitated with sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid if decomposition of the reaction mixture occurs; 2% phosphoric acid; and catalysts and UV light. Trichloroacetic acid has also been produced without catalysts.  The crude product, containing about 95% trichloroacetic acid, is best isolated by crystallizing the melt, removing the mother-liquor with most of its impurities, and increasing the purity by centrifugation or recrystallization.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern.

Environment: A potential risk to the aquatic compartment is identified due to high toxicity to algae and local exposure from use as auxiliary in textile dyes, waste water from electroplating facilities, textile washing and pulp mills. A potential risk to the terrestrial environment is identified due to high toxicity to plants and global exposure from the decomposition of C2-chlorocarbons. Human health: The chemical is reprotoxic, corrosive and an eye irritant but adequate protection measures are currently being applied. Trichloroacetic acid is currently considered of low potential risk and low priority for further work. SHORT SUMMARY WHICH ...TCA is mostly used in the production of TCA Na-salt used as a herbicide. TCA is also used as an auxiliary in textile dying processes. ... The most sensitive environmental species to TCA is the alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa (14d-NOEC = 0.01 mg/L) and pine (60d-EC10 = 0.12 mg/kg).The acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity is low. This chemical is corrosive and strongly irritant to the eyes. The NOEL in a 90-day study in dogs - the most sensitive species tested - was determined as 500 ppm (approx. 30 mg/kg bw/day). The NOEL for repeated dose toxicity in a 4-month feeding study with rats was 4000 ppm (365 mg/kg bw/day), the NOEL in a 2-year feeding study in rats was 1600 ppm (80 mg/kg bw/day). An inconsistent picture was found in tests on genotoxic action. Point-mutation tests were predominantly negative. In-vivo tests of chromosome mutations were mostly positive, but effects only appeared after high loading of the animals. The SCE test in mice was negative. The results of a micronucleus test in mice are apparently not reproducible. The end point of the sperm anomaly test is not necessarily due to genetic damage. The validity of the positive test results described for the clastogenic effects in mice suffers from the partly insufficient experimental procedure. Drinking water studies in male and female mice to 52 or 61 weeks gave an increased incidence of tumors in the livers of the male mice only. A 2-year feeding study with rats and a drinking water study over 100 - 104 weeks in rats showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. Reproduction toxicology investigations in rats showed maternal and embryonic toxicity from 330 mg/kg body weight and from 800 mg/kg also embryo-lethality. In all dose-groups there was a dose dependent increase in visceral anomalies, particularly in the cardiovascular system. The mean frequency of soft tissue malformations ranged from 9% at the low dose (330 mg/kg) to 97% at the high dose (1800 mg/kg/day). A NOAEL could not be established. Based on these findings TCA was considered to be developmentally toxic in the pregnant rat at doses of 330 mg/kg and above. ... Considering the low exposure potential to humans, available toxicity data support a low risk to human health. The tumorigenic action in male mouse liver corresponds to the type, which leads to liver tumors preferentially in male mice via peroxisome proliferation, hepatotoxicity and liver cell proliferation.",

DCA, TCA and to a lesser extent chloroform decreased the methylation and increased the mRNA expression of the c-myc gene. Co-administering chloroform prevented only DCA and not TCA-induced hypomethylation and increased mRNA expression of the gene. The effect of chloroform on tumor promotion by DCA and TCA was determined in female and male B6C3F1 mice initiated on day 15 of age with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Starting at 5 weeks of age, the mice received in their drinking water DCA (3.2 g/L) or TCA (4.0 g/L) with 0, 800 or 1600 mg/L chloroform until they were killed at 36 weeks.

The ability of trichloroacetate (TCA) or dichloroacetate (DCA) pretreatment to alter the metabolism of bromodichloroacetate (BDCA) and the disposition of its metabolites was examined in male B6C3F1 mice. Two-week pretreatment with 1 g/L DCA and TCA in the drinking water of mice alters the initial hepatic metabolism of BDCA and the further metabolism of its metabolite DCA. DCA pretreatment inhibits cytosolic metabolism of both 1 mM DCA or BDCA up to 70%. In contrast, DCA pretreatment stimulates hepatic microsomal BDCA metabolism 1.3-fold but has little effect on microsomal metabolism of DCA. Increased microsomal metabolism of BDCA appears to be attributable to the induction of a metabolic pathway that produces CO2 and bromodichloromethane (BDCM) as metabolites. TCA pretreatment inhibits BDCA metabolism up to 70% in the cytosol and 30% in microsomes but has little effect on DCA metabolism. These results indicate that the hepatic metabolism of the haloacetate becomes quite complex at the high doses that have been employed in cancer bioassays. BDCA serves as a good example, because it is metabolized to at least two carcinogenic metabolites that have different modes of action, BDCM and DCA. As doses approach those that induce cancer in mice, the proportion of and amounts of these metabolites as a fraction of the dose administered will change substantially. This article demonstrates that those interactions will occur from mixed treatment with haloacetates as well.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.0X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates trichloroacetic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase trichloroacetic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 31 hrs. Trichloroacetic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, trichloroacetic acid is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 130. The pKa of trichloroacetic acid is 0.51, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.35X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. A half-life of trichloroacetic acid in soil reported as 119.6 days in a laboratory experiment indicates that biodegradation is not a fast environmental fate process. If released into water, trichloroacetic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A pKa of 0.51 indicates trichloroacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. BCF values of 0.1 to 1.7 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to trichloroacetic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where trichloroacetic acid is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to trichloroacetic acid via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound in pharmaceutical products containing trichloroacetic acid.

The pKa of trichloroacetic acid is 0.51(4), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization of trichloroacetic acid from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.35X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(6). Trichloroacetic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 6.0X10-2 mm Hg(7). A half-life of trichloroacetic acid in soil reported as 119.6 days in a laboratory experiment(8) indicates that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.35X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(4). A pKa of 0.51(5) indicates trichloroacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(6). According to a classification scheme(7), a BCF range of 0.4 to 1.7(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A 7% theoretical BOD after 4 weeks incubation with activated sludge and the Japanese MITI test(8) indicates that biodegradation is not a fast environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase trichloroacetic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 31 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.2X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The rate of degradation of trichloroacetic acid was studied in untreated, fertilized, and limed fine sand and humus soil. The soils were treated with 12.6 mg/kg radioactively labeled TCA and the total count of bacteria able to utilize trichloroacetic acid for growth was determined after two weeks of inoculated bacteria incubation at 14-15 \u00b0C. Bacteria able to grow in trichloroacetic acid fine sand samples ranged from about 25 to 275 C.F.U. (colony forming units) X10+5/g soil; growth on trichloroacetic acid humus samples ranged from about 15 to 60 C.F.U X10+6/g soil. Liming increased the rate of trichloroacetic acid degrading bacteria, especially in sandy soil(2). A half-life of trichloroacetic acid in soil was reported as 119.6 days in a laboratory experiment(3). General soil studies indicated that trichloroacetic acid was subject to microbial decomposition. Disappearance of trichloroacetic acid was favored by warm moist conditions and trichloroacetic acid breakdown in soils was most rapid under conditions conducive to high microbiological activity. Trichloroacetic acid breakdown was low in sandy soils. Trichloroacetic acid experienced a lag period in biodegradation: a period in which low degradation was followed by rapid degradation(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Increasing exchangeable acidity and field water capacity decreased phytotoxicity of TCA(1). The mobility of trichloroacetic acid in Hagerstown silt clay loam was determined using soil thin layer chromatography. Results showed an Rf value of 0.96, corresponding to a classification of 5, high mobility(2). Trichloroacetic acid was found to have a Koc value of 1, very high mobility in soil, and a short half-life of 20 days in soil. The pH of the soil was not recorded(3). Trichloroacetic acid was applied to stands of Typha spp. and Phragmites australis in earthen supply canals in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas and Districts of New South Wales, Australia. The dissipation interval of 17-19 days showed that the trichloroacetic acid was eluted from the sediment into the flowing water in proportion to the square root of time, giving average concns over three days of discharge of more than 0.4 g/cu m(4). After preplant application of 60 kg/ha of trichloroacetic acid to strawberries, the level of total nitrogen in the soil had decreased 1.3 to 2 fold; the level of potassium and phosphorus had decreased 1.5 to 8 fold. Ammonium and nitrate disappeared almost completely. The effect of trichloroacetic acid lasted for 3.5 to 4 months(5).",

Waters of 237 wells in Ontario, Canada were analyzed over a 10 year period (1969-1978) due to contamination from herbicide spillage in or near the wells. Herbicides were identified in 159 wells. Trichloracetic acid was identified in only one well at concns ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 ug/L; trichloroacetic acid residue entered the well during storm runoff from rain water(2). Concns of trichloroacetic acid were determined in irrigation water after the sodium salt had been applied at 82 kg/ha for control of reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) to the banks of dry canals near Wapato, WA in November 1968 and November 1969. The canals were drained and then refilled five months later. Maximum concns of trichloroacetic acid in the water ranged from 53 to 297 ppb. Concn was highest during the first hour of waterflow and trichloroacetic acid was not detected after four hours of flow(3). Trichloroacetic acid was detected in 2 samples of groundwater from France, max concn of 0.1 ug/L and in 39+ samples from The Netherlands, max concn of 2.4 ug/L(4).",

The Pellow and MW-T wells were the offsite and onsite wells, respectively. Results showed a total dose of trichloroacetic acid at the Pellow well to be 8.6X10-4 mg/kg/day and a total dose of trichloroacetic acid at the MW-T well to be 1.5X10-3 mg/kg/day(1). A method was developed to isolate and quantify trichloracetic acid and dichloroacetic acid by capillary gas chromatography with electron-capture detection, with a detection limit of 0.1 ug/L. Water samples from the Glenmore Water Treatment Plant in Calgary, Canada resulted in an average concn of 11.1 ug/L trichloracetic acid(2). Thirty-five water treatment facilities across the United States were selected to determine the presence of disinfection by-products from spring 1988 to winter 1989 . Quarterly median concns of trichloroacetic acid were reported as 5.8 ug/L - spring 1988, 5.8 ug/L - summer 1988, 6.0 ug/L - fall 1988, and 4.0 ug/L - winter 1989, utilizing gas chromatography electron capture detection(3). Twenty drinking water samples were taken from various treatment plants in the Netherlands from surface waters and groundwater to determine the amount of haloacetic acid levels. Using GC analysis with electron capture detection, concns of trichloroacetic acid ranged from 0.2 to 1.4 ug/L(4). Tap water samples collected on October 22, 1981 near two water treatment plants that supply Amherst, MA were analyzed using GC atomic emmission detection. Quantitative recoveries of trichloroacetic acid in the water samples showed levels ranging from 10 to 1000 ug/L(5). Swimming pool water contains halogenated organic compounds at levels of 97, 46, and 253 ug chlorine/L for indoor pools with Cl disinfection, chlorine/ozone disinfection and outdoor pools, respectively, with trichloroacetic acid being one of the main chlorine compounds identified(6).",

Results showed that concns of trichloroacetic acid ranged from 6 to 276 ug/kg in the pine needles, the highest concns found at the sites closest to the pulp mills(1). Trichloroacetic acid concentration in leaves and needles ranges from <1 to 44 ug/kg and 0.6 to 178 ug/kg, respectively(2).",

Occupational exposure to trichloroacetic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where trichloroacetic acid is produced or used(SRC). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to trichloroacetic acid via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound in products containing trichloroacetic acid(SRC).

Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected from 95 inhabitants of the village of Oitti and 21 inhabitants of the village of Hattula. GCMS detection of trichloracetic acid, a metabolite of TCE and TeCE, showed a range in Oitti of 19 to 1500 ng/kg/day and in Hattula a range of <5 to 340 ng/kg/day(1). Plasmatic trichloroacetic acid was used as a tracer for monitoring exposure to trichloroethylene (TRI) and tetrachloroethylene (PER) in Milan, Italy during the periods June-July 1978, November-December 1979, and June-July 1979. Twenty-four persons body fluids was analyzed using GC Ni-63 electron capture detection. Concns of trichloroacetic acid were higher for those exposed to >50 ug/L TRI/PER than for those exposed to <1 ug/L TRI/PER. Plasmatic levels of TCA were higher in winter than in summer(2). Trichloroacetic acid was detected in 76% of 403 adult urine samples tested as part of a chlorinated drinking water survey, at a concentration ranging from <0.5 to >25 ug/L, with frequency of detection higher in urban than rural areas of the US(3). Following 30 minute swims/walks in swimming pools with trichloroacetic acid concentrations ranging from 57 to 871 ug/L, urinary levels ranged from 33 to 653 ug(4).",

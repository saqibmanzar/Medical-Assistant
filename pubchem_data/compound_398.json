The primary routes of potential human exposure to 2-nitropropane are dermal contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Contact with this compound can cause irritation of the eyes and skin. Acute inhalation exposure to low levels of 2-nitropropane vapors can result in irritation of the respiratory tract. Breathing higher levels of this chemical may cause anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

At least 40% of the inhaled compound was absorbed. Blood concentrations of 2-NP measured by gas chromatographic analysis decreased in an apparent first order manner (half life = 48 min). Half lives for the biphasic elimination of radioactivity from blood were two to four times longer, indicating that metabolites have a greater potential to accumulate. The major route of excretion was the expired air. About half of the administered radioactivity was recovered as 14CO2. Numerous differences in kinetic parameters observed at the two exposure concentrations indicated nonlinear kinetics at 154 ppm and higher.There were no differences in uptake or exhalation processes between males and females, but metabolic processes differed. A first-order, low-affinity but high capacity metabolic pathway was more than twice as active in females. The saturable pathway was predominant in females at exposure concentrations up to 180 ppm but only up to 60 ppm in males. Because males are more sensitive to hepatoxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity produced by inhalation of 2-NP, /it was/ concluded that these effects are produced by the metabolite resulting from the first-order pathway.",

Ten minutes after an injection of 25 mg/kg, the blood plasma contained 3.3% of the dose as 2-NP and 1.9% as metabolites, acetone, and isopropanol, indicating an uptake of >5.2% since presumably some of the dose was already lost from the body and to other tissues in the body during this initial period. These percentages were estimated from the data ... and normative data for the laboratory rat. A dose of 50 mg/kg yielded partially dissimilar results. The 10-min average value was low and also had a very large standard deviation. This may have reflected large differences among the rats in their initial uptake rates for 2-NP or an experimental problem such as injection into the gastrointestinal tract rather than the peritoneal cavity. Blood plasma contained, 10 min after injection, only 1.4% of the dose as 2-NP and 1.3% as acetone and isopropanol. These data indicate that uptake from the peritoneal cavity is fairly rapid, and suggest that the relatively slower uptake of the 50-mg/kg dose may have reflected saturation of the uptake mechanisms, since initial concentrations in the plasma did not exceed those following the 25-mg/kg dose.",

The latter were produced in roughly equal quantities. Surprisingly, however, the rate of this reaction was not diminished under conditions of reduced oxygen pressure. The activity of preparations from untreated control rats was generally very low. /It was/ demonstrated that this enzyme system in rats was active in metabolizing other aliphatic nitro compounds. ...Working with mice, /researchers/ obtained somewhat different results. They reported rapid denitrification of 2-NP to nitrite and acetone by liver microsomes from untreated mice,and an acetone production at least twice the nitrite release. These authors suggested that multiple forms of cytochrome P-450 are involved, and claimed that nitrite is sequestered in the reaction mixture and that denitrification of 2-NP may involve a reductive or at least non-oxidative pathway as well as an oxidative pathway. They also noted large differences in the rates of hepatic microsomal enzymatic nitrite release among the five strains of mice tested. ...Hepatic microsomes from uninduced rabbits could denitrify a compound related to 2-NP, 2-nitro-1-phenylpropane. In addition to oxidative denitrification, a reductive pathway has been shown to occur in cultured hepatocytes from Wistar rats and in V79 Chinese hamster cells. Nitroreduction was indicated by the fact that the cells formed acetone oxime, the tautomeric form of nitrosopropane.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In the presence of Fe(III) EDTA, both IPHA and HAS caused DNA damage at every nucleotide position without marked site preference. The damage was inhibited by free hydroxyl radical (-*OH) scavengers, catalase and deferoxamine mesilate, an iron chelating agent. These results suggest that the DNA damage was caused by -*OH generated via H(2)O(2) by both IPHA and HAS. In contrast, in the presence of Cu(II), IPHA frequently caused DNA damage at thymine. The Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage caused by IPHA was inhibited by catalase, methional and bathocuproine, a Cu(I)-specific chelator, suggesting the involvement of H(2)O(2) and Cu(I). These results suggest that the DNA damage induced by IPHA in the presence of Cu(II) was caused by a reactive oxygen species like the Cu(I)-hydroperoxo complex. On the other hand, HAS most frequently induced DNA damage at 5'-TG-3', 5'-GG-3' and 5'-GGG-3' sequences. Catalase and methional only partly inhibited the Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage caused by HAS, suggesting that the reactive oxygen species and another reactive species participate in this process. Formation of 8-oxodG by IPHA or HAS increased in the presence of metal ions. This study suggests that metal-mediated DNA damage caused by 2-NP metabolites plays an important role in the mutagenicity and the carcinogenicity of 2-NP.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

                                "Description": "In general, the occupational exposure limit (OEL) indicates the level of admissible exposure, for a length of time (usually 8 hours), to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health of a worker. The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Rats were pre-treated with a single dose of diphenyl diselenide (10, 50 or 100 micromol/kg). Afterward, they received only one dose of 2-NP (100 mg/kg bw dissolved in olive oil). The parameters that indicate tissue damage such as plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), creatinine and urea were determined. Since toxicity induced by 2-NP is related to oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation was also evaluated. Diphenyl diselenide (100 micromol/kg) significantly reduced plasma ALT, gamma-GGT, AFP levels when compared to 2-NP group. Treatment with diphenyl diselenide, at all doses, effectively protects the increase of lipid peroxidation when compared to 2-NP group. Histological examination revealed that 2-NP treatment causes a moderate swelling and degenerative alterations on hepatocytes and diphenyl diselenide (100 micromol/kg) protects against these alterations. Diphenyl diselenide (50 and 100 micromol/kg) significantly decreased the urea level. This study evidences the protective effect of diphenyl diselenide by 2-NP-induced acute hepatic damage.",

Cell proliferation was quantitated by incorporation of 3H-thymidine, detected by autoradiography, into newly synthesized DNA. Histopatholgical study was carried out to investigate the morphological changes. Twenty four hours after 2-NP administration, there was an increase in the labelling index (LI) and grain count per labelled nucleus (GC/N) in the hepatocytes of 2-NP-injected rats versus those of control animals. The increase was 69.5% in LI and 29.4% in GC/N. Melatonin treatment, 30 minutes preceding 2-NP, reduced the increase in LI (44.4%) and GC/N (20.7%) when compared with 2-NP-treated rats. Histopathology revealed multiple focal areas of necrosis in the liver following 2-NP injection. In the lung, there was a mucinous degeneration of the bronchial epithelium. Melatonin treatment restored the histopathological changes in both the liver and lung and they are more or less normal.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 17.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-nitropropane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-nitropropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 95 days. 2-Nitropropane is expected to undergo direct photolysis in the atmosphere based on 95% degradation after 24 hours and a half-life of 9.8 days measured during tests for photodegradation. If released to soil, 2-nitropropane is expected to have very high mobility based upon Koc values of 0.11 and 3.8. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.19X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. The pKa of 2-nitropropane is 7.68, indicating that this compound will partially exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. 2-Nitropropane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation in soil is expected to be slow based on 3.0 and 1.2% conversion to CO2 in aerobic and anaerobic soil, respectively after 35 days. If released into water, 2-nitropropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Biodegradation in water is expected to be slow based on 0.8% mineralization after 5 days using activated sludge and 0.1-14% degradation in 28 day closed bottle tests. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A pKa of 7.68 indicates 2-nitropropane will exist partially in the anion form at neutral and basic pH and therefore volatilization from water surfaces may be hindered under these conditions. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hours and 6 days, respectively. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-nitropropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-nitropropane is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 2-nitropropane via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing 2-nitropropane. (SRC)",

Volatilization of 2-nitropropane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.19X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from a vapor pressure of 17.2 mm Hg(3) and a water solubility of 1.70X10+4 mg/L(4). 2-Nitropropane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon the estimated vapor pressure(3). Half-lives of 2-nitropropane measured during aerobic batch laboratory microcosm experiments were 0.66 days in an acid clay soil (0.94% OC, pH 4.8) and 0.5 days in a basic sandy loam soil (3.25% OC, pH 7.8)(5,6). However, experiments were not corrected for potential loss due to volatilization(5,6). Biodegradation in soil is expected to be slow based on 3.0 and 1.2% conversion to CO2 in aerobic and anaerobic soil, respectively, after 35 days(7,8).",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hours and 6 days, respectively(SRC). The pKa of 2-nitropropane is 7.68(6), indicating that this compound will partially exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(7). According to a classification scheme(8), BCF values of <8.4(9,10), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation in water is expected to be slow based on 0.8% mineralization after 5 days using activated sludge and 0.1-14% degradation in 28 day closed-bottle test(9-11).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 2-nitropropane is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 6 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 6 days(SRC). A pKa of 7.68(4) indicates 2-nitropropane will exist partially in the anion form at neutral and basic pH and therefore volatilization from water surfaces may be hindered under these conditions(SRC).  2-Nitropropane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 2-nitropropane from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

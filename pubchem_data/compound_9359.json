When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Seven workers from the grid-casting area and 14 workers from the formation area were examined with regard to the antimony concentration in blood (Sb-B) and urine (Sb-U). Antimony air concentrations (Sb-A) were measured by means of personal air samplers. Urine samples were collected at the end of the working week, at the beginning (U1) and the end (U2) of the shift, and at the beginning of work following a weekend without Sb exposure (U3). At U2 among the casters, the median Sb-A exposure was 4.5 (1.18-6.6.6) ug Sb/cu m and among the formation workers, 12.4 (0.6-41.5) ug Sb/cu m. The exposure in both groups is more than 10 times lower than the present threshold limit values. The median Sb-B concentrations in the preshift samples was 2.6 (0.5-3.4) ug Sb/L for the casters and 10.1 (0.5-17.9) ug Sb/L for the formation workers. The average Sb-U values (U2) were 3.9 (2.8-5.6) ug Sb/g creatinine in the forming area. Our investigation indicates that the two antimony compounds show virtually equal pulmonary absorption and renal elimination. The statistically significant correlations between Sb-A/Sb-B and Sb-A/Sb-U form the basis for proposals regarding appropriate biological exposure limits for occupational antimony exposure.",

The adrenal glands, lung, large intestine, trachea, cerebellum, and kidneys also contain relatively high levels of antimony. Blood is the main vehicle for the transport of absorbed antimony to various tissue compartments of the body. Antimony is a metal and, therefore, does not undergo catabolism. Antimony can covalently interact with sulfhydryl groups and phosphate, as well as numerous reversible binding interactions with endogenous ligands (e.g., proteins). It is not known if these interactions are toxicologically significant. Antimony is excreted via the urine and feces. Some of the fecal antimony may represent unabsorbed antimony that is cleared from the lung via mucociliary action into the esophagus to the gastrointestinal tract. (L741)",

The pentavalent compounds, as well as most of the trivalent ones, are hydrolyzed by water to form antimony salts, e.g., SbOCl, and hydrated oxides. The only halides of antimony that have any industrial significance are the chlorides and fluorides. /Antimony compounds/",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The short-term exposure (also called acute exposure) is a short contact with a chemical. It may last a few seconds or a few hours. For example, it might take a few minutes to clean windows with ammonia, use nail polish remover or spray a can of paint. The fumes someone might inhale during these activities are examples of acute exposures.",

High purity stibine is used as an n-type gas phase dopant for silicon in semiconductors. It has been used as fumigating agent. It is also used in the production of lead batteries. HUMAN STUDIES: Stibine is a toxic gas that has effects similar to those of arsine, but stibine is not encountered as frequently as arsine. The most likely route of exposure to stibine is inhalation. Stibine attacks the blood and central nervous system. In acute poisoning, the signs in man are headache, nausea, weakness, slow breathing, and weak and irregular pulse. One of the early signs of overexposure to stibine in man may be hemoglobinuria. Laboratory findings may include: anemia, elevated bilirubin (indirect), hyperkalemia, damaged red blood cells (basophilic stippling, anisocytosis, Heinz-Ehrlich bodies), low haptoglobin, elevated plasma-free hemoglobin levels, elevated urinary hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, abnormal liver function tests, thrombocytopenia. Stibine gas is not capable of inhibiting cholinesterase activity at toxicologically relevant concentrations. ANIMAL STUDIES: The odorless toxic gas stibine, like arsine, is a potent hemolytic agent. The lethal concentration of stibine in air for mice is about 100 ppm for 1.6 hr. The formation of Heinz bodies in red blood cells was associated with acute stibine exposure that may underlie its hemolytic effects. Stibine was found genotoxic in vitro (significant nicking to pBR 322 plasmid DNA).",

It is possible that antimony affects circulating glucose by interfering with enzymes of the glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. The mechanism of action of antimony remains unclear. However, some studies suggest that antimony combines with sulfhydryl groups including those in several enzymes important for tissue respiration. The antidotal action of BAL depends on its ability to prevent or break the union between antimony and vital enzymes. Moreover, the The cause of death is believed to be essentially the same as that in acute arsenic poisoning.  Stibine reacts with water to form hydrochloric acid which has a direct corrosive effect on mucous membranes. (L793, T18, L741, A238)",

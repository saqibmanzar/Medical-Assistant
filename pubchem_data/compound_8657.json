ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Exposure to this colorless liquid may occur from its use as a solvent; as an intermediate in the manufacture of divinylbenzene and napthalene; and in powderless etching. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, and irritation of the mucous membranes. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and protective clothing. If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. Contaminated clothing and shoes should be removed at the site. 1,2-Diethylbenzene may be ignited by heat, sparks, and flames. Containers of this substance may explode in the heat of a fire. Also, its heavier-than-air vapor may travel to a source of ignition and flash back, or may accumulate to explosive concentrations in confined spaces such as sewers. For fires involving 1,2-diethylbenzene, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or standard foam. Isolate the area for 1/2 mile in all directions if a tank, rail car, or tank truck is involved in the fire. For small spills of 1,2-diethylbenzene, take up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and place into containers for later disposal. For large spills, use water spray to reduce vapor and dike far ahead of the spill for later disposal.",

Male Sprague-Dawley-rats with surgically implanted cranial electrodes were administered 0, 75, or 100mg/kg DEB orally or were injected intraperitoneally with 0, 10, or 15mg/kg DAB daily 4 days a week for 8 weeks. Evaluation was based on clinical signs of toxicity, body weight gain, and urine sample analysis. BAEPs elicited in response to auditory click stimuli were measured periodically during dosing and up to 10 weeks after dosing (recovery). DEB administration was associated with: a blue discoloration of the skin and urine; decreased body weight after the first week of treatment; severe hindlimb weakness and gait disturbances; a dose and time related increase in peak latencies and decreases in amplitude of all five components of the BAEP; and prolonged interpeak latencies. DAB toxicity was similarly characterized. Of the 15 rats, 11 given the 15mg/kg dose and two given the 10mg/kg dose died. DAB induced decrements in the BAEPs similar to those caused by DEB. The increases in peak and interpeak latencies induced by both DAB and DEB showed signs of returning to the control values during the recovery period. The decreases in peak amplitude of the BAEP components did not recover. The authors conclude that DEB and DAB, its putative metabolite, are toxic to the central nervous system. The observed effects on the BAEP indicate that DEB and DAB induce functional alterations in the auditory pathways.",

Intraperitoneal administration of 10 mg kg/1 and 20 mg kg/1 1,2-diacetylbenzene to groups of 12 rats, 4 days a week for 11 and 6 weeks, caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease in mean sensory and motor conduction velocities. Recovery in a 5-week post-exposure period was gradual but consistent. The effect of 1,2-diacetylbenzene on the amplitude of the sensory action potential was ambiguous. The findings support the hypothesis that the formation of 1,2-diacetylbenzene derivatives contributes to the neurotoxicity of 1,2-diethylbenzene.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.05 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,2-diethylbenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,2-diethylbenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. 1,2-Diethylbenzene absorbs light in the environmental UV spectrum, and thus has the potential for direct photolysis. If released to soil, 1,2-diethylbenzene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1600. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 1,2-Diethylbenzene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 1,2-diethylbenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Groundwater and marine water grab sample tests suggests that 1,2-diethylbenzene will biodegrade completely in groundwater in 5 days and to a lesser extent in marine water, rate not specified. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.4 hr and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 150 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 1,2-diethylbenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2-diethylbenzene is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 1,2-diethylbenzene via inhalation and dermal contact with this compound in consumer products containing 1,2-diethylbenzene, such as gasoline. (SRC)",

The potential for volatilization of 1,2-diethylbenzene from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon a vapor pressure of 1.05 mm Hg(5). 1,2-Diethylbenzene at a concn of 22.7 ug/l was completely removed within 5 days from a gas oil mixture at a concn of about 2 mg/l added to acclimated fresh-wellwater grab samples from Tuffenwies and Zurich, Switzerland, with a pH of 8.0, at 10 and 25 \u00b0C and microbial populations of 300-400 cells/ml(7). A gas oil mixture with a concn of 0.5 ppm contained 1,2-diethylbenzene, which degraded in North Sea coastal water maintained at 20 \u00b0C for 14 days(8).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.00261 atm-cu m/mole(4) estimated from its vapor pressure, 1.05 mm Hg(8), and water solubility, 71.1 mg/l(9). Using this estimated Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.4 hr and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 150(SRC), from its log Kow of 3.72(6), and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Groundwater(10) and marine water grab sample tests(11), in which 1,2-diethylbenzene was a constituent of gas oil mixtures, suggests that 1,2-diethylbenzene may biodegrade in the aquatic environment.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 1,2-diethylbenzene is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 1.4 hr(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). 1,2-Diethylbenzene's estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 1,2-diethylbenzene from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.05 mm Hg(1).",

Off-gas concns from the Skyway Waste treatment and Highland Creek plant in Ontario, Canada consisted of 37 and 739 ug/cu m 1,2-diethylbenzene, respectively(3). 1,2-Diethylbenzene is reported to be a product of combustion engines(4). Formation water from offshore oil production platforms was found to contain 1,2-diethylbenzene at a concn of 140 ug/l(5). 1,2-Diethylbenzene was identified as a vapor emitted from landfills(6). Leachate samples taken from Guelph and Muskoka municipal waste treatment plants in Ontario were tested for 1,2-diethylbenzene and none was detected(7). 1,2-Diethylbenzenes were found in unquantified amounts in the effluent sample of a water treatment plant(9). 1,2-Diethylbenzene was detected, but not quantified, as an introduced volatile organic compound in the water of a test stand basin after a four-stroke outboard motor filled with unleaded gasoline was left in operation for 10 minutes(8).",

Reaction with fluorine, however, does not proceed satisfactorily because of cleavage of not only the Si--H but also C--Si and C--H bonds. Direct halogenation with chlorination, bromine, and iodine proceeds smoothly, however. /Organosilanes/",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Explosive limits specify the concentration range of a material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an ignition source. There are two types of explosive limits: lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL). The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Higher exposure can cause pulmonary edema, a medical emergency that can be delayed for several hours. This can cause death. Bleeding of nose and gums, ulceration of the nasal and oral mucosa, pulmonary edema, chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia may also occur. If the eyes have come in contact with dimethyldichlorosilane, irritation, pain, swelling, corneal erosion, and blindness may result. Dermatitis (red, inflamed skin), severe burns, pain, and shock generally follow dermal exposure. Inhalation irritates mucous membranes. Severe gastrointestinal damage may occur. Vapors cause severe eye and lung injury. Upon short contact, second and third degree burns may occur. Signs and symptoms of acute ingestion of dimethyldichlorosilane may be severe and include increased salivation, intense thirst, difficulty swallowing, chills, pain, and shock. Oral, esophageal, and stomach burns are common. /Dimethyldichlorosilane/",

These data suggest that the acute toxicity of chlorosilanes is due to the hydrogen chloride hydrolysis product; acute toxicity of the chlorosilanes is both qualitatively (based on clinical signs) and quantitatively (based on molar equivalents of hydrogen chloride) similar to that of HCl. Complete hydrolysis of one mole of a monochlorosilane would yield a maximum of one mole of hydrogen chloride. Complete hydrolysis of a dichlorosilane would yield a maximum of two moles of hydrogen chloride, complete hydrolysis of a trichlorosilane would yield a maximum of three moles of hydrogen chloride, and complete hydrolysis of tetrachlorosilane would yield a maximum of four moles of hydrogen chloride. /Chorosilanes/",

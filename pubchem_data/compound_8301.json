When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The rate with microsomes was four times that with cytosol fractions. Evidence for this metabolic pathway in vivo has been obtained by the identification of the cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates of tetrafluoroethylene in rat bile. Cytochrome P-450 oxidation, a common metabolic route for haloalkenes, does not appear to occur in the metabolism of tetrafluoroethylene ... When administered po to rats, the synthetic cysteine conjugate of tetrafluoroethylene causes renal damage identical to that caused by tetrafluoroethylene itself. The conjugate was metabolized by renal slices in vitro giving pyruvate, ammonia, and a reactive species which caused marked inhibition of organic ion transport into slices. Purified renal beta-lyase also cleaved this conjugate giving stoichiometric amounts of pyruvate and ammonia ... The nephrotoxicity of tetrafluoroethylene is believed to derive from the hepatic glutathione conjugate of this compound. Following excretion and degradation of this conjugate in bile, the cysteine conjugate is reabsorbed and further metabolized in the kidney by the enzyme beta-lyase to a cytotoxic species.",

The rate with microsomes was four times greater than with cytosol. Fluoride ion release was equivalent to approximately 20% of the glutathione used. The quantities of glutathione used and of fluoride ion released in incubations were identical whether cytochrome P450 was active or had been inactivated with carbon monoxide. Thus, cytochrome P450 oxidation, a pathway common to many haloalkenes, does not appear to be involved in the metabolism of tetrafluoroethylene. Evidence for the glutathione conjugation pathway in vivo comes from the identification of the cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates of tetrafluoroethylene in rat bile, following oral administration of L-[35S]cysteine and then inhalation exposure to 6000 ppm [24 600 mg/cu m] tetrafluoroethylene for 6 hr. S-(1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine is metabolized in vitro in rat renal cortex slices to give pyruvate and ammonia, a reaction that is catalyzed by beta-lyase and which also generates a reactive thiol that is probably important in renal cytotoxicity.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

TFEC-induced cell death is associated with an early covalent modification of specific intramitochondrial proteins; including aconitase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) subunits, HSP60 and HSP70. Previous studies have indicated that the TAMH line accurately models TFEC-induced in vivo cell death with dose- and time-dependent inhibitions of both KGDH and aconitase activities. Here, ...  the molecular pathway leading to TFEC-mediated cell death /was shown to be/ associated with an early cytosolic to mitochondrial translocation of BAX, a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family. Immunoblot analyses indicated movement of BAX (21 kDa) to the mitochondrial fraction after exposure to a cytotoxic concentration of TFEC (250 uM). Subsequent cytochrome c release from mitochondria was also demonstrated, but only a modest increase in caspase activities was observed, suggesting a degeneration of early apoptotic signals into secondary necrosis. Significantly, TAMH cells overexpressing BCL-xL preserved cell viability even to supratoxicological concentrations of TFEC (< or =600 uM), and this cytoprotection was associated with decreased HSP70i upregulation, indicating suppression of TFEC-induced proteotoxicity. Hence, TFEC-induced necrotic cell death in the TAMH cell line is mediated by BAX and antagonized by the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member, BCL-xL. / S-(1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine/",

Toxicity is due to cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyases, which convert the cysteine S-conjugate into pyruvate, ammonia and a reactive sulfur-containing fragment. ... Mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase and mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase exhibit beta-lyase activity toward S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (the cysteine S-conjugate of trichloroethylene) and S -(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine (the cysteine S-conjugate of tetrafluoroethylene). Turnover leads to eventual inactivation of these enzymes. Here /it is reported/ that mitochondrial L-alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase II, which, in the rat, is most active in kidney, catalyses cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase reactions with S -(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine, S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine and S -(benzothiazolyl-L-cysteine); turnover leads to inactivation. Previous workers showed that the reactive-sulfur-containing fragment released from S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl) L-cysteine and S -(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine is toxic by acting as a thioacylating agent - particularly of lysine residues in nearby proteins. Toxicity, however, may also involve 'self-inactivation' of key enzymes. The present findings suggest that alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase II may be an important factor in the well-established targeting of rat kidney mitochondria by toxic halogenated cysteine S-conjugates. Previous reports suggest that alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase II is absent in some humans, but present in others. Alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase II may contribute to the bioactivation (toxification) of halogenated cysteine S-conjugates in a subset of individuals exposed to halogenated alkenes. / S-(1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine/",

S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine (TFEC) ... Most halogenated cysteine S-conjugates are metabolized by cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyases to pyruvate, ammonia, and an alpha-chloroenethiolate or an alpha-difluoroalkylthiolate (with TFEC) that may eliminate halide to give a thioacyl halide, which reacts with epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues in proteins. Nine mammalian pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-containing enzymes catalyze cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase reactions, including mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mitAspAT), and mitochondrial branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT(m)). Most of the cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyases are syncatalytically inactivated. TFEC-induced toxicity is associated with covalent modification of several mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism. Interestingly, the alpha-ketoglutarate- and branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (KGDHC and BCDHC), but not the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), are susceptible to inactivation. mitAspAT and BCAT(m) may form metabolons with KGDHC and BCDHC, respectively, but no PLP enzyme is known to associate with PDHC. Consequently, /it was hypothesized/ that not only do these metabolons facilitate substrate channeling, but they also facilitate toxicant channeling, thereby promoting the inactivation of proximate mitochondrial enzymes and the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction. /S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine/",

AEGLs are used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures.  AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Explosive limits specify the concentration range of a material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an ignition source. There are two types of explosive limits: lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL). The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Doses of > or = 12.5 mg/kg /ip dose of 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-L-cysteine (TFEC)/ produced renal tubular necrosis to the pars recta of the proximal tubules within 24 hr in both male and female rats. This was associated with an increased kidney to body weight ratio and plasma urea at doses of > or = 25 mg/kg. No consistent evidence of liver injury was seen at doses up to 50 mg/kg TFEC in rats of either sex, although occasional vacuolation of hepatocytes and a small dose-related increase in liver to body weight ratio was observed. Prior treatment of female rats with probenecid completely prevented the renal injury produced by either 25 or 50 mg/kg TFEC as judged by plasma urea and histopathology. However, prior treatment of female rats with aminooxyacetic acid afforded no protection against the nephrotoxicity produced by either TFEC or the cysteine conjugate of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene. Thus no major sex difference in nephrotoxicity in the rat was seen with TFEC, while accumulation of TFEC, or its N-acetyl derived metabolite, into renal proximal tubular cells via a probenecid sensitive transport system appears to be a key event in the mechanism of nephrotoxicity. /1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-L-cysteine/",

There were no significant differences in hematology parameters that were considered to be related to tetrafluoroethylene exposure. Absolute and relative kidney weights of all exposed groups of males were significantly greater than those of the controls, as were those of females in the 2,500 and 5,000 ppm groups. The absolute kidney weight of females exposed to 1,250 ppm was also significantly greater than that of the controls. The relative liver weights of all exposed groups of males and the absolute liver weights of males in the 625 and 2,500 ppm groups were significantly greater than those of the controls. Increased incidences of renal tubule degeneration occurred in males and females exposed to 625 ppm or greater; this lesion was located predominantly at the corticomedullary junction. The severity of degeneration increased with increasing exposure concentration and was slightly greater in males than females.",

The final mean body weight and body weight gain of males exposed to 5,000 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls, as was the mean body weight gain of females in this exposure group. There were no clinical findings attributed to exposure to tetrafluoroethylene. Exposure of rats to tetrafluoroethylene resulted in a concentration-dependent normocytic, normochromic, nonresponsive anemia consistent with a secondary hypoproliferative anemia. An exposure concentration-dependent proteinuria also occurred, consistent with renal tubule degeneration observed histopathologically. The absolute and relative liver weights of all exposed groups of males and of females in the 5,000 ppm group were significantly greater than those of the controls. The absolute and relative right kidney weights of males and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and of females in the 625 ppm group were also significantly greater than those of the controls. There were no differences in sperm morphology or vaginal cytology parameters between control and exposed groups of rats. Incidences of renal tubule degeneration in males exposed to 625 ppm or greater and in females exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm were significantly greater than those in the controls. Renal lesions were similar to those observed in the 16-day study and were located predominantly at the corticomedullary junction.",

No clinical signs of toxicity resulting from TFE exposures were observed in rats and hamsters during the treatment period. After termination of exposure, rats exhibited a statistically significant decrease in serum albumin and albumin/globulin ratios at all exposure levels, although the effect was not dose related. Urinary fluoride in rats was elevated in a dose dependent manner at all levels, but differences were only significant in the 500,991 and 2489 ppm exposure groups. Other differences noted in rats included significant and dose dependent decreases in serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase activity and urea nitrogen levels at the 500, 991 and 2489 ppm dose levels. Additionally, rats showed a significant depression in serum alkaline phosphatase activity in the 2489 ppm group. After 14 days of recovery all effects had disappeared in rats, except elevation of urinary fluoride. After termination of exposure, hamsters exhibited a significant increase in urinary fluoride excretion in the 991 and 2489 ppm groups. Serum albumin depression was significant in the 101 ppm exposure group. After the 14 day recovery period serum albumin depression was significant in the 500,991, and 2489 ppm exposure groups; urinary fluoride was at normal levels. Following 10 exposures, 5 of 5 rats exposed at the 2489 ppm level exhibited compound related kidney histopathology which disappeared after 14 days of recovery. No histopathological effects were observed in hamsters after 10 exposures, however, following the 14 day recovery period a significant increase in testicular atrophy was observed in the 2489 exposure group. Rats showed significant elevation of absolute and relative weights of liver and kidneys following the 10th exposure in the 991 and 2489 ppm exposure groups. These effects were not present after the 14 day recovery period. There were no significant differences in absolute or relative organ weights in hamsters exposed to any level of TFE.",

The following statistically significant clinical effects were observed in rats: lower mean body weights during most of the study, and lower overall body weight gains for male and females at 2000 ppm; higher incidence of alopecia and sores for animals in the 2000 ppm group; exposure related increases in urinary fluoride levels in males and females; increased urine volume in females exposed to 600 or 2000 ppm TFE with accompanying decreases in osmolality in the 200 and 2000 ppm groups; and decreased creatinine in all treated females. The only significant clinical observation reported in hamsters was an increase in the frequency of ocular abnormalities (scabs over eyes) in females exposed to 600 or 2000 ppm TFE. Rats showed the following significant blood related effects: a decrease in the serum albumin/globulin ratio at 45 days in all treated females; decreased serum albumin in 600 and 2000 ppm females at 45 days, and in 2000 ppm females at 90 days; elevated serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase activity in females exposed at the 2000 ppm level; decreased hematocrits in 200 and 2000 ppm male rats, with decreased mean corpuscular volumes in 2000 ppm male rats; and temporarily elevated leukocyte counts in the 600 and 2000 ppm female rats. The only significant hematological effect reported in hamsters was a decrease in serum albumin in 2000 ppm males at 90 days. Following necropsy, significant observations in rats included a dose related increase in kidney and liver weights at the 2000 ppm level, and tubular nephrosis of the straight portions of the proximal convoluted tubules in animals exposed to 600 or 2000 ppm TFE, observed at 45 and 90 days. Observations in hamsters included a dose related increase in mean relative liver weights in females; and atrophic changes in immature or mature testes of hamsters exposed to 2000 ppm TFE.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.45X10+4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tetrafluoroethylene will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase tetrafluoroethylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours. Gas-phase tetrafluoroethylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone and nitrate. The Global Warming Potential is considered to be negligible. Tetrafluoroethylene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tetrafluoroethylene is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 95. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.63 atm-cu m/mole. Tetrafluoroethylene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, tetrafluoroethylene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to tetrafluoroethylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tetrafluoroethylene is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.63 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.45X10+4 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 159 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 1.21(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2010).",

Gas-phase tetrafluoroethylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.13X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 298 K(3). Gas-phase tetrafluoroethylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone(3,4) and nitrate radicals(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of tetrafluoroethylene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated as 1.13X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 298 K(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of tetrafluoroethylene with ozone has been reported as 4.8X10-21 cu cm/molecule-sec at 298 K(1). The Global Warming Potential is considered to be negligible(5). Tetrafluoroethylene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(6), and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 17 hours(SRC) at an atmospheric concentration of 1X10+6 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of tetrafluoroethylene with ozone has been reported as 4.8X10-21 cu cm/molecule-sec at 298 K(1). Carbonyl fluoride and oxygen have been observed as products of the vapor-phase ozonolysis of tetrafluoroethylene at room temperature; carbonyl fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene oxide and traces of perfluorocyclopropane have been identified as ozonolysis products when the olefin is in excess(2). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of tetrafluoroethylene with photochemically-produced nitrate radicals has been estimated as <3X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 298 K(1). Tropospheric lifetimes of 1 day, 9 years, and >156 days have been reported for hydroxyl, ozone, and nitrate reactions, respectively. Carbonyl fluoride is also a product of the hydroxyl and nitrate radical reactions and is rapidly incorporated into aerosols and raindrops, eventually being converted to HF and CO2(1). An atmospheric lifetime of 1.9 days has been reported and the Global Warming Potential is considered to be negligible(3). Tetrafluoroethylene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Tetrafluoroethylene does not contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4), and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

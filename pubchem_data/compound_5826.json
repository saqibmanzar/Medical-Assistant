It is the dextrorotary stereoisomer of the amphetamine molecule, which can take two different forms. It is a slightly polar, weak base and is lipophilic. The exact mechanism of action is not known. Dextroamphetamine stimulates the release of norepinephrine from central adrenergic receptors. At higher dosages, it causes release of dopamine from the mesocorticolimbic system and the nigrostriatal dopamine systems by reversal of the monoamine transporters. Dextroamphetamine may also act as a direct agonist on central 5-HT receptors and may inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO). In the periphery, amphetamines are believed to cause the release of noradrenaline by acting on the adrenergic nerve terminals and alpha- and beta-receptors. Modulation of serotonergic pathways may contribute to the calming affect.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Wt loss and pattern of daily food intake differed depending upon the isomer, dose, and degree of tolerance. Two types of tolerance were seen with both isomers, an initial tolerance with a decr in efficacy between days 1 and 2, and a later gradual decr in efficacy over 12 days of repeated dosage. Rats tolerant to the anorectic effects of d-amphetamine were only minimally affected when challenged with an equiactive anorectic dose of l-amphetamine, while rats tolerant to the anorectic effects of l-amphetamine showed a significantly depressed food intake and modified eating pattern when challenged with an equiactive dose of d-amphetamine.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Amphetamines are distributed into most body tissues with high concentrations occurring in the brain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).  Amphetamine appears in the urine within about 3 hours following oral administration. Urinary excretion of the amphetamines is pH-dependent and excretion is enhanced in acidic urine. Following oral administration of racemic amphetamine to humans, approximately equal amounts of both isomers were excreted during the first 12 hours; after the first 12 hours, a continually decreasing proportion of the d-isomer was excreted. Following oral administration of a 70-mg radiolabeled dose of lisdexamfetamine (a prodrug of dextroamphetamine), 96% of the dose was recovered in the urine; of the recovered radioactivity, 42% of the dose was related to amphetamine, 25% to hippuric acid, and 2% to the parent drug. Dextroamphetamine and levamfetamine (no longer commercially available in the US) appear to have different metabolic fates, but the relationship between the fate of the drugs and their pharmacologic activity has not been determined. There are some data to indicate stereospecific metabolism of amphetamine and its isomers, but stereospecific urinary excretion appears unlikely.",

Much of the (14)C was excreted in the 24 hr urine after ip admin of amphetamine to dogs & guinea pigs, & oral admin to other species. Three days after a dose of (+ or -)-amphetamine, human subjects had excreted 91% of the (14)C in the urine, rats 86%, rabbits 86%, & dogs 78%. The last 3 species excreted 5%, 7%, & 0% of the dose respectively in 3 day feces. Since excretion of (14)C over broad time intervals did not differ significantly within each species whether (+ or -)-amphetamine or its optical isomers was given, the above data can be compared with results obtained when an optical isomer was given to monkeys, mice, & guinea pigs. Thus, after a dose of (+)-amphetamine, (also known as dexamphetamine ...), guinea pigs excreted 88% of the (14)C in the 2 day urine, mice excreted 87% in the 3-day urine, & a monkey excreted 80% in the 3 day urine. Another monkey excreted less than 58%. Of interest was that man, monkey, dog, & mouse excreted about 30% of the (14)C as unchanged amphetamine in 24 hr, whereas guinea pig excreted 22%, rat excreted 13%, & rabbit only excreted 4%. These results confirmed an earlier study of the excretion of (14)C & of unchanged amphetamine in rats given (+ or -)-amphetamine at 4 different dose levels orally & at 1 level sc. ... These earlier studies showed that rates of excretion of (14)C were similar after oral or ip dosing, thus indicating comparable & rapid absorption of amphetamine in these animals by two routes.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of oral dextroamphetamine in plasma and quantify the rate of deposition into hair in healthy adults using a linked population pharmacokinetic model. METHODS: Healthy adults >18 years of age received dextroamphetamine 10 mg orally for 7 days. Plasma samples were collected over 48 h following the final dose, and hair was collected 5 weeks following the first dose. NONMEM 7.2 was used to estimate dextroamphetamine oral absorption rate constant, apparent clearance and volume of distribution of the plasma compartment, the plasma to hair incorporation rate constant, and the apparent volume of distribution in the hair compartment. RESULTS: Dextroamphetamine pharmacokinetics were well-described by a one-compartment model with combined additive and proportional error for the plasma compartment, which was linked to a single compartment for the hair. Apparent clearance and volume of distribution in the plasma compartment were scaled by current body weight (centered on the mean). Melanin hair concentration was included as a significant covariate on the hair compartment. Absorption rate constant, clearance, and volume of distribution for the plasma compartment were estimated as 0.527 hr(-1) (95 % CI 0.467-0.586), 28.7 L/hr (95 % CI 27.1-30.3), and 377 L (95 % CI 326-428), respectively. The incorporation rate constant from plasma to hair was 1.60e(-6) hr(-1) (95 % CI 1.06e(-6)-2.14e(-6)) and apparent volume of distribution in hair was 17.7 mg (95 % CI 12.5-22.8). CONCLUSIONS: A one-compartment plasma model linked to a single compartment for hair successfully described the pharmacokinetics of dextroamphetamine in healthy adults. The volume of distribution and clearance of dextroamphetamine increased with weight, and the volume of distribution of the hair compartment increased with greater melanin concentrations.",

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is a prodrug and has little, if any, pharmacologic activity until converted to dextroamphetamine by first-pass intestinal and/or hepatic metabolism. Inactivation of sympathomimetic noncatecholamines largely depends on breakdown by monoamine oxidase and since substitution of an alkyl group for hydrogen on the a-carbon atom blocks enzymatic inactivation of the amino group, the duration of action of noncatecholamines (but not of catecholamines, which are inactivated largely by a different mechanism) is prolonged by a-substitution. The absence of a hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring of amphetamine reduces inactivation of the drug in the GI tract and the amphetamines are active following oral administration.",

It is used for treatment of narcolepsy and hyperkinetic states in children.  It can be misused for performance enhancement, relief of fatigue.  Abuse of this drug either orally or by injection is extremely common.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Main risks include acute central nervous system stimulation, cardiotoxicity causing tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypertension and cardiovascular collapse. High risk of dependency and abuse. Cardiovascular effects include: palpitation, chest pain, tachycardia, arrhythmias and hypertension; cardiovascular collapse can occur in severe poisoning. Myocardial ischemia, infarction and ventricular dysfunction were described. CNS effects include: stimulation of CNS, tremor, restlessness, agitation, insomnia, increased motor activity, headache, convulsions, coma and hyperreflexia.  Stroke and cerebral vasculitis have been observed. Gastrointestinal effects include: vomiting, diarrhea and cramps. Acute transient ischemic colitis has occurred with chronic methamphetamine abuse. Genitourinary effects including: increased bladder sphincter tone which may cause dysuria, hesitancy and acute urinary retention. Renal failure can occur secondary to dehydration or rhabdomyolysis. Renal ischemia and transient hyperthyroxinemia may be noted. Increased metabolic and muscular activity may result in hyperventilation and hyperthermia. Weight loss is common with chronic use. Hypo- and hyperkalemia have been reported. Dehydration is common. Fasciculations and rigidity may be noted. Rhabdomyolysis is an important consequence of severe amphetamine poisoning. Agitation, confusion, mood elevation, increased wakefulness, talkativeness, irritability and panic attacks are typical. Chronic abuse can cause delusions and paranoia.  A withdrawal syndrome occurs after abrupt cessation following chronic use.  Anorexia, insomnia, psychopathic personality disorders, suicidal tendencies, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and other disorders, hyperthyroidism, narrow angle glaucoma, diabetes mellitis and cardiovascular diseases such as angina, hypertension and arrythmias. In adults: the toxic dose varies considerably due to individual variations and the development of tolerance. Children appear to be more susceptible than adults and are less likely to have developed tolerance. The use of amphetamine for medical indications does not pose a significant risk to the fetus for congenital anomalies. Amphetamines generally do not appear to be human teratogens. Mild withdrawal symptoms may be observed in the newborn, but the few studies of infant follow-up have not shown long-term sequelae. Illicit maternal use or abuse of amphetamine presents a significant risk to the fetus and newborn, including intrauterine growth retardation, premature delivery and the potential for increased maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity. Cerebral injuries occurring in newborns exposed in utero appear to be directly related to the vasoconstrictive properties of amphetamines. Sixty five children were followed whose mothers were addicted to amphetamine during pregnancy, at least during the first trimester. Intelligence, psychological function, growth, and physical health were all within the normal range at eight years, but those children exposed throughout pregnancy tended to be more aggressive.  ANIMAL STUDIES: d-Amphetamine decreased the accuracy of visual stimulus duration discriminations in pigeons. In both rhesus monkeys and baboons d-amphetamine decreases reaction times to visual and auditory stimuli. This effect was dose dependent, however, with increases in reaction time predominating after higher doses. The decreased reaction times following d-amphetamine occur in the absence of changes in size discrimination thresholds or brightness discrimination in the monkey. In the squirrel monkey, however, d-amphetamine produced modest increases in masked auditory thresholds.",

Dextroamphetamine stimulates the release of norepinephrine from central adrenergic receptors. At higher dosages, it causes release of dopamine from the mesocorticolimbic system and the nigrostriatal dopamine systems by reversal of the monoamine transporters. Dextroamphetamine may also act as a direct agonist on central 5-HT receptors and may inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO). In the periphery, amphetamines are believed to cause the release of noradrenaline by acting on the adrenergic nerve terminals and alpha- and beta-receptors. Modulation of serotonergic pathways may contribute to the calming affect.",

Eight received dextroamphetamine 7.5 mg intravenously, 6 received 15 mg intravenously and 6 who served as controls received intravenous saline. The 7.5 mg dose reduced serum prolactin by 25 to 32% compared to control, but the difference was not statistically significant. The 15 mg dose significantly decreased serum prolactin by 30 to 37% at times after the infusion. No assessment of milk production was presented. The authors also quoted data from another study showing that a 20 mg oral dose of dextroamphetamine produced a sustained suppression of serum prolactin by 40% in postpartum women. The maternal prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed.",

Eight received dextroamphetamine 7.5 mg intravenously, 6 received 15 mg intravenously and 6 who served as controls received intravenous saline. The 7.5 mg dose reduced serum prolactin by 25 to 32% compared to control, but the difference was not statistically significant. The 15 mg dose significantly decreased serum prolactin by 30 to 37% at times after the infusion. No assessment of milk production was presented. The authors also quoted data from another study showing that a 20 mg oral dose of dextroamphetamine produced a sustained suppression of serum prolactin by 40% in postpartum women. The maternal prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed.",

For more information on Adderall\u00ae, please see our fact sheet at https://mothertobaby.org/fact-sheets/dextroamphetamine-amphetamine-adderall/.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take your medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.",

Some evidence suggests that large doses of dextroamphetamine could lower milk supply in people who are newly breastfeeding.The product labels for some dextroamphetamine products recommend people who are breastfeeding not use these medications. But the benefit of using dextroamphetamine and the benefits of breastfeeding your child may outweigh the possible risks. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about using dextroamphetamine and what treatment is best for you. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about all your breastfeeding questions.",

Experience with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to permit recommendation in this regard.

If acute, severe hypertension complicates amphetamine overdosage, administration of intravenous phentolamine has been suggested. However, a gradual drop in blood pressure will usually result when sufficient sedation has been achieved. Chlorpromazine antagonizes the central stimulant effects of amphetamines and can be used to treat amphetamine intoxication. (L1712)",

There is limited information comparing non-therapeutic lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine exposures. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare lisdexamfetamine exposures with dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release. METHODS: A retrospective observational case series of single-substance exposures to lisdexamfetamine, dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release, or dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release reported to the National Poison Data System from 2007 to 2012 was performed. Data were analyzed for demographics, reason, clinical effects, management site, and outcomes. RESULTS: There were 23,553 exposures: lisdexamfetamine (7,113), dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release (6,245), and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release (10,195). The most frequent clinical effects observed for lisdexamfetamine, dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release, and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release were agitation (19.8%, 21.7%, and 25.1%, respectively) and tachycardia (19.2%, 22.8%, and 23.9%, respectively). The reason was most often exploratory (93.4%) in children < 6 years and therapeutic error (65.6%) in children aged 6-12 years. In adolescents and adults most common reasons were suicide attempts (28.4%) followed by abuse (19.5%) and therapeutic errors (18.8%). Overall, 61.6% of cases were managed in a health care facility, with the majority treated in the emergency department only. The majority of cases (76.0%) experienced no or minor effects. More serious outcomes (moderate/major/death) occurred in 21.2% of lisdexamfetamine, 24.7% of dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release, and 25.5% of dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release. There were 4 deaths (1 dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release and 3 dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release). In patients aged 6 years and more, abuse/misuse was more frequently reported for dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release (32.5%) and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release (23.0%) than that for lisdexamfetamine (13.5%). The odds of abuse/misuse was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0-2.4) times higher for dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release than that for lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release combined; the odds of dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release abuse/misuse was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.7-2.2) times higher than lisdexamfetamine. In 2011, the number of lisdexamfetamine abuse/misuse cases exceeded dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release by approximately 26% and plateaued in 2012, but was significantly lower (~75%) than dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release. CONCLUSIONS: Toxic effects were similar for all three drugs. Although the majority of cases were treated at health care facilities, the majority of patients experienced no effects or minor toxicity. Serious outcomes occurred in approximately 21% of lisdexamfetamine and 25% of dextroamphetamine/amphetamine extended release and dextroamphetamine/amphetamine immediate release. Lisdexamfetamine may have less abuse potential, especially compared with the immediate-release dextroamphetamine/amphetamine formulation.",

However, little is known about the neurochemical changes that occur when these two conditions are experienced concomitantly. 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) mRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is diminished following withdrawal from d-amphetamine (AMPH) and may underlie the emotional and cognitive impairments observed in psychostimulant withdrawal, but whether stress affects 5-HT2AR mRNA expression during psychostimulant withdrawal is unknown. The goal of this study was to examine the impact of forced swim test (FST) exposure during AMPH withdrawal on 5-HT2AR mRNA expression in PFC. Animals were treated 3 times a day for 4 days with escalating doses of AMPH (1-10mg/kg) and 24hr or 4 days after the final injection, animals were subjected to FST. At 24hr of withdrawal, AMPH-treated animals showed greater immobility in FST and at 4 days of withdrawal, AMPH-treated animals did not show immobility. At 24h of withdrawal, animals showed lower 5-HT2AR mRNA expression in the PFC relative to saline-treated animals, and exposure to FST did not further decrease expression in these animals. At 4 days of withdrawal, AMPH-treated animals showed greater 5-HT2AR mRNA expression relative to saline-treated animals in the PFC, an effect that was diminished by exposure to FST. These data indicate that stress and short-term AMPH withdrawal affect prefrontal 5-HT2AR mRNA expression to a similar degree, and stress experienced during long-term AMPH withdrawal can diminish the recovery of 5-HT2AR mRNA expression. Together, these data suggest that exposure to stress during extended AMPH withdrawal could prolong withdrawal-induced, 5-HT2AR mRNA expression which could be related to 5-HT2AR mediated deficits.",

Latency to initiate feeding and time to complete it were recorded for each segment. Bilateral microinjections of d-amphetamine (2.5, 10, or 20 ug) into nucleus accumbens 10 min before feeding dramatically increased the mean speed with which meal segments were eaten, but had no reliable effects on mean latency to initiate eating of new segments; l-amphetamine (10 ug) had similar but weaker effects. For d-amphetamine, mean latency under 20 ug was 0.52 sec and control latency was 0.97 sec. Median feeding duration under 20 ug d-amphetamine was 12.3 sec vs 20.7 sec for controls. While mean eating speed was increased, this incr resulted from a decr in the frequency of slow trials and not from an incr in the absolute speed of the fastest trials.",

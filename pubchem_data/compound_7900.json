PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In contrast to alpha-PGME, where 50 to 60 % of the dose was oxidized completely, only 10 % of the radio-label associated with beta-PGME was eliminated as 14C-CO2.

The most common toxic effects of PM observed in animal studies include sedation, very slight alpha(2u)-globulin mediated nephropathy (male rats only) and hepatomegally at high exposures (typically > 1000 ppm). Sedation in animal studies usually resolves within a few exposures to 3000 ppm (the highest concentration used in subchronic and chronic inhalation studies) due to the induction of metabolizing enzymes. Data from a variety of pharmacokinetic and mechanistic studies have been incorporated into a PBPK model for PM and its acetate in rats and mice. Published controlled exposure and workplace biomonitoring studies have also been included for comparisons of the internal dosimetry of PM and its acetate between laboratory animals and humans. PM acetate is rapidly hydrolyzed to PM, which is further metabolized to either glucuronide or sulfate conjugates (minor pathways) or propylene glycol (major pathway). In vitro half-lives for PM acetate range from 14 to 36 min depending upon the tissue and species. In vivo half-lives are considerably faster, reflecting the total contributions of esterases in the blood and tissues of the body, and are on the order of just a few minutes. Thus, very little PM acetate is found in vivo and, other than potential portal of entry irritation, the toxicity of PM acetate is related to PM. Regardless of the source for PM (either PM or its acetate), rats were predicted to have a higher Cmax and AUC for PM in blood than humans, especially at concentrations greater than the current ACGIH TLV of 100 ppm. This would indicate that the major systemic effects of PM would be expected to be less severe in humans than rats at comparable inhalation exposures. /propylene glycol monomethyl ether/",

An existing analytical method including a solid-phase extraction and derivatization before GC/FID analysis is available but presents some disadvantages. We present here an alternative method for the determination of urinary 1M2P based on the headspace gas chromatography technique. We determined the 1M2P values by the direct headspace method for 47 samples that had previously been assayed by the solid-phase extraction and derivatization gas chromatography procedure. An inter-method comparison based on a Bland-Altman analysis showed that both techniques can be used interchangeably. The alternative method showed a tenfold lower limit of detection (0.1 mg/L) as well as good accuracy and precision which were determined by several urinary 1M2P analyses carried out on a series of urine samples obtained from a human volunteer study. The within- and between-run precisions were generally about 10%, which corresponds to the usual injection variability. We observed that the differences between the results obtained with both methods are not clinically relevant in comparison to the current biological exposure index of urinary 1M2P. Accordingly, the headspace gas chromatography technique turned out to be a more sensitive, accurate, and simple method for the determination of urinary 1M2P.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The fumes someone might inhale during these activities are examples of acute exposures.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Commercial PGME (CAS 130-67-8) typically contains at least 98.5% 1-methoxy-2-propanol (alpha isomer) and only 1.5% of 2-methoxy-1-propanol (beta isomer).  PGME is a colorless liquid, miscible with water and many organic solvents. This makes it useful for a wide variety of solvent applications in the manufacture of lacquers, paints, dyes, inks, cleaning agents and liquid soaps.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY:  PGME alpha (1-methoxy-2-propanol) has low toxicity.  In male volunteers, following exposure to 100 ppm of PGME the subjects felt that the odor was too strong to be tolerated, but odor tolerance developed within 25 min. During a 3.5-hr exposure at 100 ppm, mild eye irritation was noted in 3 of the 6 individuals. At 250 ppm, the majority of the 23 subjects exposed for 1-7 hr complained of eye, nose or throat irritation; several subjects developed headaches, and one was nauseated. None of the exposures resulted in changes in visual, coordination, neurological or brake-reaction tests. Clinical studies (e.g., blood cell count, SGOT, SGPT, BUN and complete urinalysis) completed before and after exposure showed no effects.  In vitro testing in primary cell cultures of nasal respiratory epithelia of healthy individuals showed that 1-methoxy-2-propanol induces the transcription of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines and mediators but largely not translation of those; suggesting the existing exposure limits seem to be safe with respect to inflammatory responses of the upper respiratory tract. ANIMAL STUDIES: 1-Methoxy-2-propanol was not a skin sensitizer in guinea-pigs following 24 or 48 hour exposure and did not cause skin irritation when tested in rabbits.  It was classifed as mildly irritating to rabbit eyes.  The effects from iv injection in dogs were those of pain at the site of injection, shallow breathing, decreased blood pressure, auricular arrhythmia, and death due to convulsions.  A decreased growth rate was seen in rats exposed to 10,000 ppm for 4 hr/day, 5 days/wk for 2 weeks. Large dermal doses in rabbits produced CNS depression and death.  A slight increase in kidney weights was also noted in rabbits exposed to 10 mL/kg beneath bandages clipped to abdomens for a 90 day period (65 doses).  In rats exposed to 0, 300, 1000, or 3000 ppm (0, 1.09, 3.62, or 10.9 mg/L) of PGME for 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk, for 13 weeks had hepatocellular hypertrophy but were without evidence of degenerative changes. There was an increase in the urinary pH of male rats exposed to 3000 ppm PGME for 4 weeks.  Studies in laboratory animals indicate that PGME is not carcinogenic; there were no increases in tumors in any tissue in a 2-year study of male and female mice exposed to PGME via inhalation.  PGME has resulted in developmental and reproductive toxicity.   In a rat 2-generation reproduction study exposed to 3000 ppm of PGME vapors via inhalation for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week prior to mating, and 6 hours/day, 7 days/week during mating, gestation, and lactation, for 2 generations had toxicity in the P1 and P2 adults, as evidenced by sedation during and after exposure, and mean body weights which were as much as 21% lower than controls. This was accompanied by lengthened estrous cycles, decreased fertility, decreased ovary weights, and histologic ovarian atrophy in maternal rats. In the offspring from these dams, decreased body weights, reduced survival and litter size, slight delays in puberty onset, and histologic changes in liver and thymus in the F1 and F2 offspring were observed. No reproductive/neonatal effects were observed at 1000 ppm.  In multiple studies, PGME fed to mice, rats, and rabbits during gestation resulted in delayed ossification of the skull only in the rat fetus;  a delayed ossification of the skull, at the highest dose.  PGME was negative in the Ames Salmonella/mammalian-microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames test) using tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA 1537 and TA1538 and PGME was non-clastogenic to CHO cells in culture.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate possible acute effects of an exposure to 100 ppm 1-methoxypropanol-2 on the upper airways of human subjects. Twenty subjects were exposed in a crossover design to 100 ppm 1-methoxypropanol-2 and to air in an exposure chamber for 4hr. Subjective symptoms were assessed by questionnaire. Olfactory thresholds for n-butanol and mucociliary transport time were measured before and after exposure. Concentrations of interleukin 1-beta and interleukin 8 were determined in nasal secretions taken after exposure. mRNA levels of interleukins 1-beta, 6 and 8, tumor necrosis factor a, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 were measured in nasal epithelial cells, obtained after exposure. Possible effects were investigated by semiparametric and parametric cross-over analyses. Subjects did not have any subjective irritating symptoms. The olfactory threshold was slightly elevated following exposure to 1-methoxypropanol-2. Mucociliary transport time did not change. Neither concentrations of interleukins in nasal secretions nor mRNA levels except for interleukin 1-beta were higher after exposure to 1-methoxypropanol-2. In conclusion, the acute exposure to 100 ppm 1-methoxypropanol-2 did not cause clear-cut adverse effects in test subjects.",

The single person exposed to 184 mg/cu m detected the odor of propylene glycol monomethyl ether but did not find the exposure irritating. At 100 ppm the subjects felt that the odor was too strong to be tolerated, but odor tolerance developed within 25 min. During a 3.5-hr exposure at 100 ppm, mild eye irritation was noted in 3 of the 6 individuals. At 250 ppm, the majority of the 23 subjects exposed for 1-7 hr complained of eye, nose or throat irritation; several subjects developed headaches, and one was nauseated. None of the exposures resulted in changes in visual, coordination, neurological or brake-reaction tests. Clinical studies (e.g., blood cell count, SGOT, SGPT, BUN and complete urinalysis) completed before and after exposure showed no effects.

Another purpose was to explore the effect of selected CYP2E1 polymorphisms on the toxicokinetic profile. Controlled human exposures were carried out in a 12 cu m exposure chamber for each solvent separately, during 6h and at half of the threshold limit value. The human volunteers groups were composed of ten young men and fifteen young women, including ten women using hormonal contraceptive. An analysis of variance mainly showed an effect on the urinary levels of several biomarkers of exposure among women due to the use of hormonal contraceptive, with an increase of more than 50% in metabolites concentrations and a decrease of up to 50% in unchanged substances concentrations, suggesting an increase in their metabolism rate. The results also showed a difference due to the genotype CYP2E1*6, when exposed to methyl ethyl ketone, with a tendency to increase CYP2E1 activity when volunteers were carriers of the mutant allele. Our study suggests that not only physiological differences between men and women but also differences due to sex hormones levels can have an impact on urinary concentrations of several biomarkers of exposure. The observed variability due to sex among biological exposure indices can lead to misinterpretation of biomonitoring results. This aspect should have its place in the approaches for setting limits of occupational exposure.",

Data collected on body weights, clinical signs, & food/water consumption during the dose-range-finding segment (Task 1) were used to set concns for the main study (Task 2) at 0.5%, 1.0%, & 2.0% PGME in drinking water. These concns produced calculated consumption estimates of nearly =0.95, 1.9, & 3.3 g/kg/day. During Task 2, no changes in body weight or water consumption were found in any of the exposure groups. There was no reduction in the number of litters/pair, the number of live pups/litter, or the viability of those pups. Mean pup weight adjusted for litter size was reduced by 4% at the top dose level. In the absence of an adverse effect on fertility, Task 3, the crossover test to identify the affected sex, was not conducted. Task 4, the evaluation of the second generation, was conducted with the control & high dose groups only. The reduced pup weight at birth, noted in the first 4 litters, continued postnatally, with males & females weighing nearly =14% less than controls during nursing. Male body weights were nearly =8% lower than controls during the mating period, while female body weights during the mating period were not affected by PGME treatment. Mating & fertility indices were unaffected by PGME, as were the number & viability of the F2 offspring. After the F2 pups were delivered, evaluated, & killed, the adult F1 mice in the control & 2% PGME groups were killed & necropsied. While female body weight was not affected by PGME exposure, body-weight-adjusted liver weight was increased by 7.5%. Male body weights in the 2% PGME group were 8% lower than controls, while absolute testis, relative epididymis & prostate weights were reduced by 7%, 7% & 15%, respectively. In summary, there was some evidence of probable developmental toxicity, expressed as reduced pup weights, but no evidence of reproductive toxicity expressed as reduced litters or pup numbers. This F1 pup weight effect was seen in the absence of an effect on F0 adult body weight.",

Another purpose was to explore the effect of selected CYP2E1 polymorphisms on the toxicokinetic profile. Controlled human exposures were carried out in a 12 cu m exposure chamber for each solvent separately, during 6h and at half of the threshold limit value. The human volunteers groups were composed of ten young men and fifteen young women, including ten women using hormonal contraceptive. An analysis of variance mainly showed an effect on the urinary levels of several biomarkers of exposure among women due to the use of hormonal contraceptive, with an increase of more than 50% in metabolites concentrations and a decrease of up to 50% in unchanged substances concentrations, suggesting an increase in their metabolism rate. The results also showed a difference due to the genotype CYP2E1*6, when exposed to methyl ethyl ketone, with a tendency to increase CYP2E1 activity when volunteers were carriers of the mutant allele. Our study suggests that not only physiological differences between men and women but also differences due to sex hormones levels can have an impact on urinary concentrations of several biomarkers of exposure. The observed variability due to sex among biological exposure indices can lead to misinterpretation of biomonitoring results. This aspect should have its place in the approaches for setting limits of occupational exposure.",

Physiological and metabolic changes in the aging process may alter how aging adults biologically respond to pollutants. In a controlled human toxicokinetic study (exposure chamber; 12 cu m), aging volunteers (n=10; >58 years) were exposed to propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME, CAS no. 107-98-2) at 50 ppm for 6 hr. The dose-dependent renal excretion of oxidative metabolites, conjugated and free PGME could potentially be altered by age. (1) Compare PGME toxicokinetic profiles between aging and young volunteers (20-25 years) and gender; (2) test the predictive power of a compartmental toxicokinetic (TK) model developed for aging persons against urinary PGME concentrations found in this study.  METHODS:  Urine samples were collected before, during, and after the exposure. Urinary PGME was quantified by capillary GC/FID. Differences in urinary PGME profiles were not noted between genders but between age groups. Metabolic parameters had to be changed to fit the age adjusted TK model to the experimental results, implying a slower enzymatic pathway in the aging volunteers. For an appropriate exposure assessment, urinary total PGME should be quantified. Age is a factor that should be considered when biological limit values are developed.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 12.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hours. 1-Methoxy-2-hydroxypropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.2X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Methoxy-2-hydroxypropane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Aerobic degradation using a sandy loam soil resulted in half-lives of <1 and <7 days at 0.2 and 100 ppm, respectively, indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 90% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of contaminated drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Occupational exposure to 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane is produced or used(SRC). In a survey of occupational exposures to glycol ethers in the northern part of Belgium, 262 of 2654 air samples collected in 336 plants contained glycol ethers and of these 13 contained 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane, 10 in printing, 1 in painting and 2 in other plant operations(2). The mean concentration of 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane during various work phases of laying parquet flooring in Finland were: undercoat varnishing with nitrocellulose, 15 ppm; urea-formaldehyde varnishing, 34 ppm; and work with water-based varnishes, 5 ppm(3). About 30% of the 7705 samples analyzed with results stored in the Norwegian occupational exposure database EXPO since 1985 contained 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane(4). Workers in the manufacture of brake hoses were found to be exposed to 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane(5). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of contaminated drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 1-methoxy-2-hydroxypropane(SRC).",

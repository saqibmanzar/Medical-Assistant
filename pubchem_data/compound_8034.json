For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Male Swiss-OF1-mice were placed in inhalation chambers and exposed to 416 to 1,515 ppm methyl isoamyl ketone. Breathing frequency was used as an index of sensory irritation to the upper respiratory tract. Breathing rate was monitored before and during a 15 minute exposure period. Neurobehavioral effect was determined by measuring the duration of immobility in mice subjected to a behavioral swimming test. A concentration/effect relationship was determined for /methyl isoamyl ketone/ based on sensory irritation and behavioral responses. All curves obtained by least square linear analysis showed a significant linear relationship between the log of the exposure concentration and the percentage decrease of each parameter. The median respiratory rate for methyl isoamyl ketone was 1,222 ppm. The 50% decrease in immobility for methyl isoamyl ketone was 446 ppm. The /data/ suggest that it is possible to predict a safe exposure dose of aliphatic ketones for humans based on observations in mice.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.77 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 5-methyl-2-hexanone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 5-methyl-2-hexanone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 37 hours. 5-Methyl-2-hexanone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 5-methyl-2-hexanone is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 250. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. 5-Methyl-2-hexanone may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, 5-methyl-2-hexanone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 hours and 6.2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 6 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 5-methyl-2-hexanone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 5-methyl-2-hexanone is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 5-methyl-2-hexanone via ingestion of food. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 5.77 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 5400 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 hours and 6.2 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 6(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Analysis is performed by HPLC with the use of a fluorescence and/or UV/visible detector. All four amines can be monitored simultaneously, and neither collection nor storage is affected by humidity. Samples are stable at room temperature for at least two weeks. The methodology has been tested for each amine at sample loadings equivalent to air concn ranges of 0.5 to 30 ppm for a sample volume of 10 liters. The method shows promise for determining other airborne primary and secondary low molecular weight aliphatic amines.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used in petroleum industry, in flotation agents, dyes, pharmaceuticals. It also used as a selective solvent for the removal of impurities from oils, fats, and waxes, and as a corrosion inhibitor in iron, steel, and metal industries. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Adult volunteers were exposed to 25 ppm (75 mg/cu m) diethylamine in a climate chamber for 15 min in order to study the acute nasal reactions to an exposure equivalent to the present threshold limit value-short-term exposure limit. Exposure to a concentration increasing from 0 to 12 ppm took place for 60 min, equal to an average concentration of 10 ppm (30 mg/cu m). A moderate to strong olfactory response and distinct nasal and eye irritation were observed. Edema of the epithelium of the cornea, generally without pain, has been produced by diethylamine vapors, causing colored halos to be seen around lights. The edema of the corneal epithelium, which is principally responsible for the disturbance of vision, clears spontaneously by the next day, but after exceptionally intense exposures the edema and blurring have taken several days to clear and have been accompanied by photophobia and discomfort from roughness of the corneal surface. ANIMAL STUDIES: Rabbits were exposed to DEN vapors at 50 and 100 ppm, 7 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks. All rabbits survived the exposures and had normal body weights without demonstrating any outward signs of response to the chemical. At 100 ppm, lungs contained cellular infiltration and bronchopneumonia; livers had parenchymatous degeneration with evidence of cell regeneration; and kidneys showed nephritis. The same changes, but to a lesser degree, were produced at 50 ppm. A suggestion of very slight cardiac muscle degeneration was seen in rabbits inhaling 50 ppm but was not evident at 100 ppm. Male and female rats were exposed at 0,25 or 250 ppm diethylamine (DEA) vapor, 6.5 hr per day, 5 days per week, for 24 weeks in order to assess cardiac and other organ system toxicity. During the first 2 weeks of exposure, the rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA did not gain weight. After 2 weeks, however, the rate of weight gain of these rats was greater than that of controls. Nevertheless, mean body weights for both sexes of rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA remained depressed compared to controls throughout the study. Sneezing, tearing, and reddened noses were seen in rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA. Histopathologic examinations revealed lesions of the nasal mucosa of rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA. These lesions of the respiratory epithelium consisted of squamous metaplasia, suppurative rhinitis, and lymphoid hyperplasia. There were no pronounced treatment-related effects on organ weights, hematology, or clinical chemistry indices except for blood urea nitrogen which was evaluated in rats of both sexes exposed at 250 ppm DEA for 24 weeks. In contrast to the high-dose animals, no treatment-related effects were observed in rats intermittently exposed at 25 ppm DEA for up to 24 weeks. No evidence of cardiotoxicity was seen in rats exposed to either DEA concentration for up to 24 weeks. Diethylamine was evaluated for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome preincubation assay. Diethylamine was tested at doses of 0, 10, 33, 100, 333, 1000, and 3333 ug/plate in four Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537) with or without metabolic activation. Diethylamine was negative in these tests. Diethylamine was not mutagenic in either of two independent bacterial mutagenicity assays, each conducted with and without exogenous metabolic activation enzymes. Bacterial strains tested included Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA/pKM101. In addition to the negative results in the two bacterial assays, no significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were seen in peripheral blood of male or female mice from the 3-month study. NTP conducted 2 year inhalation studies in rats and mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of diethylamine in male or female rats exposed to 31, 62.5, or 125 ppm. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of diethylamine in male or female mice exposed to 16, 31, or 62.5 ppm.  Exposure to diethylamine resulted in increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the nose in male and female rats and mice, of the cornea in male rats, and of the pleura and lung in female rats.",

Changes in nasal volume and nasal resistance were measured by acoustic rhinometry and by rhinomanometry. Acute change in nasal volume, usually seen as acute nasal mucosa response to thermal stimuli, was not observed, nor was an acute change in nasal airway resistance. In a subsequent experiment, the aim was to measure acute sensory effects. Exposure to a concentration increasing from 0 to 12 ppm took place for 60 min, equal to an average concentration of 10 ppm (30 mg/cu m). A moderate to strong olfactory response and distinct nasal and eye irritation were observed.",

Scheduled sacrifices were performed following 30, 60, and 120 days of exposure. During the first 2 weeks of exposure, the rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA did not gain weight. After 2 weeks, however, the rate of weight gain of these rats was greater than that of controls. Nevertheless, mean body weights for both sexes of rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA remained depressed compared to controls throughout the study. Sneezing, tearing, and reddened noses were seen in rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA. Histopathologic examinations revealed lesions of the nasal mucosa of rats exposed at 250 ppm DEA (rats exposed at 25 ppm were not evaluated). These lesions of the respiratory epithelium consisted of squamous metaplasia, suppurative rhinitis, and lymphoid hyperplasia. There were no pronounced treatment-related effects on organ weights, hematology, or clinical chemistry indices except for blood urea nitrogen which was evaluated in rats of both sexes exposed at 250 ppm DEA for 24 weeks. In contrast to the high-dose animals, no treatment-related effects were observed in rats intermittently exposed at 25 ppm DEA for up to 24 weeks. No evidence of cardiotoxicity was seen in rats exposed to either DEA concentration for up to 24 weeks.",

Diethylamine was nominated for study by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences based upon its high production volume and ubiquitous natural occurrence in trace amounts and because of the lack of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity data on the chemical. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to diethylamine (approximately 99.9% pure) by inhalation for 2 weeks, 3 months, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in bacterial mutagenicity tester strains and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes.  2-WEEK STUDY IN RATS Groups of five male and five female rats were exposed to diethylamine vapor at concentrations of 0, 31, 62.5, 125, 250, or 500 ppm, 6 hours plus T90 (12 minutes) per day, 5 days per week for 16 days. All rats survived to the end of the study. The mean body weights of 250 and 500 ppm males and females and 125 ppm males were significantly less than those of the chamber controls. Clinical findings included lethargy, nasal/eye discharge, abnormal breathing, thinness, eye abnormalities, and discolored urine. The thymus weights of males exposed to 125 ppm or greater and females exposed to 500 ppm were significantly less than those of the chamber controls. Focal eye lesions were noted at necropsy in four males and three females exposed to 500 ppm and one male exposed to 250 ppm. Crusty noses were observed in most 500 ppm males and females and in two 250 ppm males. Suppurative inflammation, necrosis of the turbinates (except in one 125 ppm female), and squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium of the nose were present in all rats exposed to 125 ppm or greater. Ulcer of the respiratory epithelium and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium occurred in all rats exposed to 250 or 500 ppm, and ulcer of the nasopharyngeal duct was present in all 500 ppm rats. Suppurative inflammation of the cornea was present in most rats exposed to 500 ppm.",

The mean body weights of males and females exposed to 125 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the chamber controls. Males and females exposed to 250 or 500 ppm lost weight during the study. Lethargy, abnormal breathing, and thinness were observed in most mice exposed to 250 or 500 ppm. Eye irritation and discharge, nasal discharge, and low fecal and urine output were noted in 500 ppm mice. Thymus weights of 250 and 500 ppm males and 125 ppm or greater females were significantly less than those of the chamber controls. Suppurative inflammation of the nose occurred in all males exposed to 250 or 500 ppm and all females exposed to 125 ppm or greater, and most males exposed to 125 ppm. Turbinate necrosis occurred in all exposed mice except one 31 ppm female. Squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium and olfactory epithelial atrophy were seen in mice exposed to 125 ppm or greater. In the lung, the incidence of minimal chronic active inflammation of mainstem bronchi was significantly increased in 500 ppm males.",

A group of 10 mice likewise inducted over 3 days with 0.1 ml dermal applications of 0.5% DNCB served as the positive control. Challenge and rechallenge were administered 7 and 14 days later in dermal applications of a 50% solution to both dorsal and ventral surfaces of the left and right ears respectively of inducted test mice. Ear thickness measured at 24 and 48-hour evaluations indicated the degree of sensitization. Challenge and rechallenge elicited no response in either test or irritation control groups at 24 or 48-hour evaluations.

Diethylamine occurs naturally in many foods and plants. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 237 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diethylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diethylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours. Diethylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diethylamine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 27. The pKa of diethylamine is 11.09, indicating that this compound will exist entirely in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. Diethylamine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 69-89% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, diethylamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Based on a biodegradation half-life of 0.9 days in stream water and 38% biodegradation in freshwater/sediment, diethylamine is expected to biodegrade in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's pKa. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to diethylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diethylamine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to diethylamine via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and contaminated drinking water, the use of tobacco products, and dermal contact with consumer products containing diethylamine.

Volatilization of diethylamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given its cationic state(SRC). Diethylamine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 237 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5). Between 69 and 89% of the Theoretical BOD was achieved for diethylamine using an activated sludge inoculum digested for 4 weeks(6), suggesting biodegradation may be an important fate process in soil(SRC).",

A pKa of 11.09(3) indicates diethylamine will exist entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). Diethylamine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 0.58(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Diethylamine, present at 10 ppm, reached 38% of its Theoretical BOD in 12 days using freshwater/sediment inoculum(7). The biodegradation half-life of diethylamine in stream water was 0.9 days at an initial concentration of 10 mg/L(8).",

Vapor-phase diethylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

In a screening study, diethylamine at 10 ppm degraded with both an activated sludge and freshwater/sediment inoculum, 59 and 38% of the Theoretical BOD was obtained after 12 days of incubation, respectively(2). Inhibition was noted at moderate concentrations and sizeable reductions in BOD were noted at 50 ppm(2). Diethylamine was degraded slowly by activated sludge even when acclimatized (53% of Theoretical BOD was achieved after 13 days)(3). However the concentration levels used in this study could not be ascertained. When added to stream water, the maximum rate of biodegradation of diethylamine was proportional to an initial amine concentration over a concentration range from several nanograms to several milligrams per liter(4). At the highest concentration studied, 10 mg/L, the half-life of diethylamine was 0.9 days(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

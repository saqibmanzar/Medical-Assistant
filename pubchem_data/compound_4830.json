It was developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1961 and started its first round of clinical trials in 1963.  In an effort to improve [haloperidol]'s pharmacological effects, Janssen discovered that pipamperone, an agent whose pharmacological profile was distinct from haloperidol and all other known antipsychotic drugs at this time, had significant anti-tryptamine activity. Some studies suggest pipamperone was the first atypical antipsychotic. Interestingly, when [risperidone] was created, Janssen suggested it was a more potent version of pipamperone. Synthesized in the year 1984, risperidone\u2019s pharmacological properties were similar to pipamperone\u2019s in that both block more serotonin more potently than dopamine.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Extrapyramidal adverse effects also appear to be limited in pipamperone treatment compared to traditional antipsychotic medications due to its high receptor selectivity.  Pipamperone has a 15-fold higher affinity for D4 than D2 receptors. It has been suggested that D4 receptors may play a role in the modulation of GABAergic neuronal activity by dopamine.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

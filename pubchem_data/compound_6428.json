When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Although a wide range of inspired concn 0.5% fluorocarbon 113, 2.5% fluorocarbon 114, and 15.0% fluorocarbon 115, is needed to produce cardiac sensitization, arterial or venous fluorocarbon concn associated with these sensitizing levels differ only slightly among the cmpds tested: 12.5, 13.8, and 5.8 ug/mL arterial and 4.9, 7.2 and 3.9 ug/mL venous respectively. Sensitizing blood levels from 25-35 ug/mL arterial and from 18-23 ug/mL venous were reported for C1 fluorocarbons 11 and 12.",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /CFCs and HCFCs/",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(v) and 2.125(e)(4)(iv) is effective December 31, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(iii) is effective June 30, 2011. Removal of 2.125(e)(2)(iv) and Part 2.125(e)(4)(viii) is effective December 31, 2013. /Ozone-Depleting Substances/",

The mean preexposure heart rate was 214.8 beats per minute and the mean preexposure atrioventricular conduction time (PQ interval was 42.9 milliseconds. Freon 113 alone elicited significant change to control levels in heart rate which was enhanced by the coadministration of hypoxia. An enhanced delayed PQ interval was noted following coadministration of Freon 113 and hypoxia, although significant PQ interval changes were noted with Freon 113 alone or with hypoxia alone. In the coadministration group, a 2:1 atrioventricular block was elicited in two of four hearts. It was suggested that in occupational deaths among Freon 113 workers, there may be complex interactions between hypoxia, enhanced cardiac sensitivity to circulating epinephrine, and direct alterations of cardiac muscle cell membrane potentials which result in arrhythmias following Freon 113 exposures.",

A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin & countershock may be effective. Cryogenic dermal injuries should be treated by water bath rewarming at 40-42 \u00b0C until vasodilatory flush has returned. Elevation of the limb & standard frostbite management with late surgical debridement should be utilized. Ocular exposure requires irrigation & slit lamp evaluation for injury. /Freons/",

Former US uses as a dry-cleaning solvent, blowing agent, solvent drying, drying electronic parts and precision equipment production and in fire extinguishers resulted in its direct release to the environment. 1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane was expected to be phased out by 1996 in developed countries and by 2006-2015 in developing countries. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 363 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. 1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane is essentially inert to reaction with photochemically generated radicals and ozone molecules. As a result of its long half-life, a substantial fraction of 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane will slowly diffuse to the stratosphere. Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine. These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer. If released to soil, 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 552. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.26X10-1 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0-5% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. However, 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane may biodegrade in soils under anaerobic conditions. If released into water, 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 11-86 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane may have occurred through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane was produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

Its former US use in fire extinguishers(1) resulted in its direct release to the environment(SRC). Fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) such as 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane were scheduled for production phase-out in 1987 by the Montreal Protocol(2). Although originally scheduled for 50% production phase-out by the year 2000 in developed countries, the worsening ozone depletion has forced acceleration of the CFC phase-out(2). 1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane is expected to be phased out by 1996 in developed countries and by 2006-2015 in developing countries(3).",

As a result of its long half-life, a substantial fraction of 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trdifluoroethane will slowly diffuse to the stratosphere. Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine. These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer(4).",

Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine. These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer(3). 1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In order to investigate the dermal absorption of aromatic diamines as well as aromatic amines possibly present as contaminants in hair dye formulations, we conducted a biomonitoring study under real-life conditions and calculated kinetics and doses for the urinary excretion. Urine samples of two female subjects were collected for a time period of 48 hr after personal application of a hair dye cream and analyzed for aromatic diamines as well as o-toluidine and 4-aminobiphenyl using highly specific GC/MS-methods. 2,5-Toluylenediamine (2,5-TDA) as active ingredient of hair dyes is rapidly absorbed dermally. After a distribution phase of 12 hr, 2,5-TDA is excreted with a half-time of 8 hr. Excretion was 90% complete within 24 hr after application. The doses of 2,5-TDA excreted within 48 hr were 700 ug for application of a brown-reddish hair dye cream and 1.5 mg for the application of a brown-black hair dye cream. Urinary 4-aminobiphenyl as well as contaminations with other aromatic diamines were not detectable in our study. Due to the artifactual formation of o-toluidine in the presence of high concentrations of urinary 2,5-TDA, our results could not prove an increased internal exposure of humans to carcinogenic amines after personal application of hair dyes.",

Elimination of radioactivity from blood and milk was determined to be biphasic. The levels of 4-ABP and/or metabolites were lower in milk than in blood at all time points examined. The levels of radioactivity detected in blood declined less rapidly than in milk. That is, the percent of the dose per ml of blood declined from 0.81-0.45, while the percent of the dose per ml of milk declined from 0.38-0.06 during the 8 hr time period. The radioactivity present in milk was partially extractable with ethyl acetate with 43% of the radioactivity being extractable at the earliest time point while only 16% was extractable after 8 hr.

A sensitive (32)P-postlabeling method enabled us to study the binding of the environmental carcinogens safrole (600 umol/kg p.o.), 4-aminobiphenyl (800 umol/kg), and benzo(a)pyrene (200 umol/kg) to the DNA of various maternal and fetal tissues after administration of test carcinogens to pregnant ICR mice on day 18 of gestation. The results show that these carcinogens bound to the DNA of maternal and fetal liver, lung, kidney, heart, brain, intestine, skin, maternal uterus, and placenta, with organ-specific quantitative and qualitative differences. It was possible for the first time to analyze DNA adduct patterns in minute amounts of tissue, for example those available from fetal heart. The covalent binding index (umol adducted nucleotides per mol of DNA nucleotides/umol carcinogen administered per g body weight) 24 hr after safrole treatment was estimated for the different organs and ranged from 0.1 to 247 and 0.1 to 5.8 for maternal and fetal DNA, respectively. Covalent binding index values of 0.2 to 13 and 0.1 to 0.3 for maternal and fetal DNA, respectively, were found for 4-aminobiphenyl. Benzo(a)pyrene treatment yielded covalent binding index values of 0.6 to 6.5 and 0.3 to 0.7 for maternal and fetal DNA, respectively. In both maternal and fetal tissues, safrole exhibited preferential binding to liver DNA. 4-Aminobiphenyl bound preferentially to DNA of maternal liver and kidney but showed no preference among fetal tissues. Benzo(a)pyrene exhibited weak tissue preference in both maternal and fetal organs. For all of the compounds studied, the fetal adduct levels were generally lower than the corresponding maternal adduct levels, especially when the level of maternal adduction was high. The major finding was that several carcinogens of diverse structure or their metabolites readily crossed the placenta and gave rise to DNA adducts in fetal organs. ...",

N-Hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl, the active metabolite of 4-aminobiphenyl, forms chemical addition products (adducts) with hemoglobin. Levels of 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adducts were measured in maternal fetal paired blood samples obtained from smoking and nonsmoking women during labor and delivery. Carcinogen hemoglobin adducts were detected in all maternal and fetal blood samples. Levels of such adducts were significantly higher (p<0.001) in maternal and fetal blood samples from smokers: the mean 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct level was 92 +/- 54 pg/g of hemoglobin in blood samples from fetuses of smokers, and 17 +/- 13 pg/g of hemoglobin in blood samples from fetuses of nonsmokers; the mean maternal 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct level was 183 +/- 108 pg/g of hemoglobin in smokers, and 22 +/- 8 pg/g of hemoglobin in nonsmokers. Fetal carcinogen adduct levels were consistently lower than maternal levels: the mean maternal to fetal ratio was 2.4 +/- 1.1 in smokers and 1.9 +/- 0.98 in nonsmokers. Fetal 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct levels were strongly associated (correlation coefficient r2= 0.51, p=0.002) with maternal 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct levels when paired samples from smoking mothers were analyzed. A measure of third trimester tobacco smoke exposure based on number of cigarettes smoked per day, amount of each cigarette smoked, and depth of inhalation was associated (r2= 0.59, p=0.029) with maternal 4-aminobiphenyl levels but not with fetal 4-aminobiphenyl levels. This study demonstrates that a potent tobacco related carcinogen, 4-aminobiphenyl, or its active metabolite, N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl, crosses the human placenta and binds to fetal hemoglobin in concentrations that are significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers.",

Forty independent carcinomas generated in athymic nude mice recapitulated diverse cancer phenotypes (including different growth kinetics and histopathological subtypes and grades) represented in clinical bladder cancers.

The K(m) and V(max) values for ABP N-hydroxylation by recombinant CYP2A13 in E. coli were 38.5 +/- 0.6 uM and 7.8 +/- 0.0 pmol/min/pmol CYP, respectively. The K(m) and V(max) values by recombinant CYP1A2 were 9.9 +/- 0.9 uM and 39.6 +/- 0.9 pmol/min/pmol CYP, respectively, showing 20-fold higher intrinsic clearance than CYP2A13. In human bladder, CYP2A13 mRNA, but not CYP1A2, is expressed at a relatively high level. Human bladder microsomes showed ABP N-hydroxylase activity (K(m) = 34.9 +/- 4.7 uM and V(max) = 57.5 +/- 1.9 pmol/min/mg protein), although the intrinsic clearance was 5-fold lower than that in human liver microsomes (K(m) = 33.2 +/- 2.0 uM and V(max) = 293.9 +/- 5.8 pmol/min/mg protein). The activity in human bladder microsomes was prominently inhibited by 8-methoxypsoralen, but not by fluvoxamine, anti-CYP1A2 or anti-CYP2A6 antibodies. CYP2S1, which is expressed in human bladder and has relatively high amino acid identities with CYP2As, did not show detectable ABP N-hydroxylase activity. In conclusion, although the enzyme responsible for ABP N-hydroxylation in human bladder microsomes could not be determined, we found that CYP2A13 metabolically activates ABP.",

However, not every individual responds to a similar degree to 4-ABP exposure, and variations in 4-ABP-Hb adduct formation might be explained by genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for enzymes involved in 4-ABP metabolism. 4-ABP-Hb adducts were measured in blood samples from 57 smoking and 10 non-smoking volunteers. An association was found between cigarette smoking and 4-ABP-Hb adduct levels in smokers (R(2) = 0.5, p<0.001). Subsequently, subjects were genotyped for 12 polymorphisms in seven genes involved in biotransformation reactions. From this selection of polymorphisms, a significant impact was found for the CYP1B1 Leu(432)Val polymorphism (p=0.021), which has been reported to lead to a decrease in enzyme activity. Indeed higher levels of 4-ABP-Hb adducts were observed in homo- and heterozygous carriers of the CYP1B1 (432)Leu as compared to the double CYP1B1 (432)Val genotype. A significant interaction between these CYP1B1 genotypes and the level of exposure was found (p=0.003). Noteworthy, a saturation effect was observed for 4-ABP-Hb adduct formation at high smoking doses limited to carriers of the CYP1B1 (432)Leu allele. No effect of polymorphisms in other genes were found. This ... study ... /suggests/ a crucial role of the CYP1B1 enzyme in 4-ABP metabolism, indicating a protective effect of the CYP1B1 Leu(432)Val polymorphism against the formation of 4-ABP-Hb adduct levels, depending on the smoking dose.",

Oligomers composed of repeating aniline (PANI) or 4-aminobiphenyl (PAB) units having the properties of conducting polymers conjoined to the DNA were prepared by the reaction of horseradish peroxidase and H2O2 with DNA having the appropriate monomers aligned within the major groove. These oligomers exhibit the spectral and chemical properties typical of para-linked polyanilines. This method of preparation enables utilization of the unique self-recognizing properties and sequence programmability of DNA to create tailored oligomers. This ability was demonstrated experimentally by preparation of PAB oligomers from alternating benzene and aniline monomers. Conjoined conducting polymers carrying the sequence information of DNA may have applicability as nanowires.",

The HPLC method uses a chemically synthesized 4-ABP-N-Glucuronide (4-ABPG) as a standard to determine the amount of glucuronide formed. 4-ABP-G was synthesized by chemical reaction between D-gucuronic acid and 4-ABP and the product formed was confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) to be that of 4-ABP-G. This was used as a reference to build the standard curve. The method was specific and sensitive. The calibration curve for the 4-ABP-G was linear from 25-500 pmol/200mL. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy for 4-ABP-G were 4% and 7% respectively. The lower detection limit was 10 pmol/200mL. The intraand inter-day precision of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity in mice liver microsomes and expressed human UGT1A4 and UGT1A9 were less than 3 and 8% respectively. The method proved to be very sensitive and it enabled us to determine the kinetics of UGTs without the need to use the radioactive [C(14)]-UDPGA, which is expensive and difficult to handle. We used this method to determine the kinetics of recombinant human UGT1A4 and UGT 1A9 for 4-ABP. The Km and Vmax of UGT1A4 were 321|nM and 133/min/mg protein and 120nM and 145 pmol/min/mg protein respectively for UGT1A9.Therefore, this method is applicable to determine the glucuronidation status towards carcinogenic arylamines. Glucuronidation of arylamines is an important step in bioactivation and distribution of the active metabolites to the target organ(s). The method could be also applicable to study kinetics of nitrogen-containing drugs for evaluation of drug interactions and side effects using small amounts of biological samples.",

Two major analytical challenges in DNA adduct analysis of human samples have been limited sample availability and the need to reach detection limits approaching the part-per-billion threshold. By operating at nano-flow rates and incorporating a capillary analytical column in addition to an online sample enrichment step, we have developed a sensitive and quantitative HPLC-MS/MS method appropriate for the analysis of such samples. This assay for the deoxyguanosine adduct of 4-ABP (dG-C8-4-ABP) gave mass detection limits of 20 amol in 1.25 ug of DNA (5 adducts in 10(9) nucleosides) with a linear range of 70 amol to 70 fmol. 4-ABP-exposed human bladder cells and rat bladder tissue were analyzed in triplicate, and higher dose concentrations led to increased numbers of detected adducts. It was subsequently established that sample requirements could be further reduced to 1 ug digestions and the equivalent of 250 ng DNA per injection for the detection of low levels of dG-C8-4-ABP in a matrix of exfoliated human urothelial cell DNA. This method is appropriate for the characterization and quantification of DNA adducts in human samples and can lead to a greater understanding of their role in carcinogenesis and also facilitate evaluation of chemopreventive agents.",

The assay includes a sensitive method for quantification of orthotoluidine 2-aminonaphthylene, and 3- and 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adducts in human blood using capillary gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Basic hydrolysis and derivatization with pentafluoropropionic acid anhydride are followed by programmable temperature vaporization and pseudo on-column capillary gas chromatography with positive electron ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Standard deviation of calibration curves (n = 6) shows that the limits of detection for o-toluidine, 2-aminonaphthylene, and 3- and 4-aminobiphenyl were 0.23, 0.39, 0.30, and 0.24 pg total on-column, respectively. The effective working limit of detection is estimated at approximately 5.22 pg/g Hb and 18.73 pg/g Hb for 4-aminobiphenyl and 2-aminonaphthylene, respectively. In a group that was predominately male and African-American, the level of 4-aminobiphenyl Hb adducts was significantly different between smokers and nonsmokers. Among 93 nonsmokers with serum cotinine concentrations less than 10 ng/mL, the geometric mean (95% CI) concentration of 4-aminobiphenyl was 29.9 pg/g hemoglobin (Hb; 29.4 to 30.4). Conversely, in 100 smokers the 4-aminobiphenyl adducts geometric mean concentration was significantly greater at 73.0 pg/g Hb (72.6 to 73.4). 4-Aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct and serum cotinine concentrations were correlated (r=0.496; p<0.0001; n=193). In 15% of smokers, 3-aminobiphenyl was detected at low concentration. Adduct levels of 2-aminonaphthylene and ortho-toluidine were not significantly different between the smoker and nonsmoker participants. Our study shows that 4-aminobiphenyl Hb adducts remain the preferred biomarker for identifying people exposed to aromatic amines from tobacco smoke.",

We describe here a method for the quantification of total 4-ABP in urine using capillary gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, with an effective detection limit in urine samples of approximately 0.87 pg/mL. We also examined the efficiency of chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis of urinary aromatic amine metabolites. Although we found acidic or basic hydrolysis effective, we found enzymatic hydrolysis (beta-glucuronidase with either Escherichia coli or Helix pomatia) ineffective. As part of this work, we also confirm the presence of N-acetyl-4-ABP and 4-ABP glucuronide in human urine samples from smokers. These metabolites have been reported in animal studies, but previously they have not been identified in human samples. These metabolites, however, were found to be unstable and thus infeasible for biomonitoring. The final validated urinary total 4-ABP assay was applied to the analysis of samples from smokers and nonsmokers, whose status was confirmed from cotinine EIA measurements. Among 41 confirmed nonsmokers, the geometric mean (95% CI) of 4-ABP concentration was 1.64 pg/mg creatinine (1.30-2.07). Conversely, in 89 smokers, the geometric mean of 4-ABP concentration was significantly greater, at 8.69 pg/mg creatinine (7.43-10.16), p<0.001. Our results indicate that following tobacco smoke exposure, total urinary 4-ABP is a reliable biomarker for exposure to this carcinogen.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: BPA is a known human carcinogen. It is an occupational bladder carcinogen and may cause cancer of the ureters and renal pelves. Eleven percent of 171 workers in a plant manufacturing BPA developed bladder tumors. Tumors appeared 5 to 19 years after initial exposure, which ranged in duration from 1.25 to 10 years. BPA forms BPA-DNA adducts in normal human urothelial mucosa and bladder tumor tissues. Levels of BPA- hemoglobin adducts in smokers of blond (flue-cured) and black (air-cured) tobacco have been found to be proportional to bladder cancer risk. Risk of bladder cancer due to exposure to occupational carcinogens is elevated in genetically determined slow acetylators. ANIMAL STUDIES: A comparison between DNA adducts and tumorigenesis indicated a linear correlation between adduct levels and the incidence of liver tumors in female mice. In the bladders of male mice, however, the relationship was markedly nonlinear. Seven rabbits were given BPA orally, and the treatment was continued until the onset of the final illness. Bladder carcinomas were observed in three rabbits, the earliest after four years of treatment. Four young adult female mongrel dogs were given BPA orally. Bladder carcinomas were observed in all four dogs after 21- 34 months. The total dose until first appearance of tumors was 87.5-144.0 g per dog (8.2-14.1 g/kg bw). In BPA- treated mice dose-related neoplasms were angiosarcomas, bladder urothelial carcinomas and hepatocellular neoplasms. The non-neoplastic dose-related lesions were left atrial thrombosis, bladder urothelial hyperplasia, splenic hemosiderosis and splenic erythropoiesis. The incidences of bladder carcinoma and atrial thrombosis were higher in the males and the incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms and angiosarcomas were higher in the females. BPA gave positive results in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. BPA produced both frameshift and base pair substitution mutations In Salmonella typhimurium TA-98 and TA-100. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: The system most sensitive to BPA was  D. magna immobilization, followed by development of zebrafish embryos, and inhibition of mammalian cell proliferation.",

In the present study, we analyzed possible interactions between the aromatic amines 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) as well as 2-naphthylamine (2-NA) and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). For this purpose we incubated primary porcine urinary bladder epithelial cells (PUBEC) with concentrations of 1 to 50 uM 4-ABP with and without co-exposure to B[a]P. As expected B[a]P increased mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), whereas 4-ABP had no effect. However, when co-exposed 4-ABP enhanced the induction of CYP1A1 by B[a]P. This result was confirmed by Western blot analysis of CYP1A1 protein expression. A similar effect as for CYP1A1 was also observed for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1). Next, we studied co-exposures of 2-NA and B[a]P.

In the current study, we correlated the level of hemoglobin adducts to 4-aminobiphenyl found in tobacco smoke. Maternal hemoglobin adduct levels were measured in subjects based on cotinine concentrations and specific genotypes of interest. Maternal subjects with cotinine levels >/= 50 ng/mL who possessed a NAT1*10 allele had higher 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct levels than subjects with the same cotinine levels who did not possess a NAT1*10 allele (alpha = 0.05, p<0.13). Maternal subject with cotinine levels >/=50 ng/mL who were NAT2 slow acetylators had slightly higher 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct levels than subjects with the same cotinine levels who were NAT2 rapid or intermediate acetylators (alpha = 0.05, p<0.52). Maternal subject with cotinine levels < 5 ng/mL who were NAT2 slow acetylators had slightly lower 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adduct levels than subjects with the same cotinine levels who were NAT2 rapid or intermediate acetylators (alpha = 0.05, p<0.30). These data suggest that the genetic polymorphisms of N-acetyltransferase may contribute to the variations in hemoglobin adduct levels seen in smokers, especially among the aromatic amines.",

In addition, risk of bladder cancer due to exposure to occupational carcinogens is elevated in genetically determined slow acetylators. In this study of normal male volunteers, 4-aminobiphenyl-hemoglobin adducts were found to be related to both the quantity and the type of tobacco smoked, as well as to the acetylator phenotype (independently of smoking habits). The demonstration that both the genetically determined slow acetylator phenotype and tobacco smoking are independently associated with levels of the carcinogen 4-aminobiphenyl in adducted hemoglobin suggests a single mechanism to explain the contribution of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure in bladder carcinogenesis.",

Pups were sacrificed at 15 days of age, separated by sex and the levels of 4-ABP:DNA adducts in liver determined using 32P-postlabeling. DNA adduct profiles were similar between male and female pups with total adduct levels of 332 and 338 fmol of adducts/mg of DNA, respectively.

This study examines the time course of DNA adduct levels in mouse target tissues, liver and urinary bladder, and nontarget tissues, lung and skin, after repeated dermal exposure to subcarcinogenic doses of 4-ABP. It was found that, in female mice dermally treated with 50 nmol of 4-ABP twice weekly for 21 weeks, DNA adduct levels measured by 32P-postlabeling increased over time in target and nontarget tissues, but the greatest rate of accumulation occurred in urinary bladder. At 21 weeks liver, urinary bladder, and skin reached their highest median adduct levels of 55, 82, and 58, respectively. Median adduct levels in lung reached a maximum of 3.2 at 3 weeks of exposure. An adduct which had similar chromatographic properties to a standard previously identified as N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-aminobiphenyl was the primary adduct detected in all tissues. There were significant correlations in adduct levels between liver and urinary bladder and liver and skin, but not between skin and urinary bladder. ...",

To assess the role of arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT)-dependent acetylation capacity in the risk for ABP-induced liver tumors, we compared 1-year liver tumor incidence following the postnatal exposure of wild-type and NAT-deficient Nat1/2(-/-) mice to ABP. At an ABP exposure of 1200 nmol, male Nat1/2(-/-) mice had a liver tumor incidence of 36% compared to 69% in wild-type males, and at 600 nmol there was a complete absence of tumors compared to 60% in wild-type mice. Only one female wild-type mouse had a tumor using this exposure protocol. However, levels of N-deoxyguanosin-8-yl-ABP-DNA adducts did not correlate with either the strain or sex differences in tumor incidence. These results suggest that female sex and NAT deficiency reduce risk for ABP-induced liver tumors, but by mechanisms unrelated to differences in DNA-damaging events.",

In this study, the effects of 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) were investigated using a battery of ecotoxicological model systems, including immobilization of Daphnia magna, development of zebrafish embryos, and inhibition of mammalian cell proliferation. The growth inhibition effects of 4-ABP were assessed on mouse connective tissue fibroblast cells (L929 cells) and human hepatocelluar carcinoma cells (HepG2 cells) by using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-trazolium bromide reduction assay. The results reveal that 4-aminobiphenyl is toxic for aquatic organisms and mammalian cells. The system most sensitive to 4-aminobiphenyl is D. magna immobilization, followed by development of zebrafish embryos, and inhibition of cell proliferation. L929 and HepG2 cell growth inhibition bioassays show low sensitivity. These findings indicate that a single model for the possible harmful effect of 4-ABP has its limitations; only a test battery, composed of bioassays on different species, can provide an accurate assessment of the action of 4-ABP in the whole environment.",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 3.2X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-biphenylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-biphenylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours. 4-Biphenylamine absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 4-biphenylamine is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2470. Aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that 4-biphenylamine may be immobile in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation rates of 0-50% over 28 days and 50% after 7 days in static system procedures suggest that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 4-biphenylamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 36 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Photooxidation may be an important fate process on water surfaces exposed to sunlight. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 4-biphenylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-biphenylamine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 4-biphenylamine via inhalation of cigarette smoke. Potential exposure may occur through dermal contact with hair dyes and ingestion of foods with food additives that may contain trace amounts of 4-biphenylamine as an impurity. (SRC)",

Aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(3,4), suggesting that 4-biphenylamine may be immobile in some soils. Volatilization of 4-biphenylamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(1). 4-Biphenylamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an extrapolated vapor pressure of 3.2X10-4 mm Hg(5). Biodegradation rates of 0-50% over 28 days and 50% after 7 days in static system procedures(6,7) suggest that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC). 4-Biphenylamine absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(8) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).[(1) Swann RL et al; Res Rev 85: 17-28 (1983) (2) US EPA; Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 36(SRC), from its log Kow of 2.86(5) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Biodegradation rates of 0-50% over 28 days and 50% after 7 days in static system procedures(6,7) suggest that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Analogous compounds, aniline and biphenyl, were classified as readily biodegradable by the Japanese MITI test with respective theoretical BODs of 85 and 66% over 2 weeks(8) which also suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). 4-Biphenylamine is an aromatic amine and aromatic amines in surface waters exposed to sunlight react with photo-oxidants with a half-life on the order of 30 days(9). Humic acids in natural water photosensitize the photo-oxidation reaction of aromatic amines and enhances degradation rates(10). 4-Biphenylamine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

In another static system procedure where a 1% solution of the chemical in an emulsifier was added to a bacterial suspension at a concentrations of 1 to 2 ppm, 4-biphenylamine was 50% degraded at the end an initial 7-day incubation period(2). Two analogous compounds, aniline (phenylamine) and biphenyl, were classified as readily biodegradable by the Japanese MITI test (OECD Guideline 301C)(3). Aniline and biphenyl, present at 100 mg/L, reached 85 and 66% of their respective theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(3).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 4-Biphenylamine absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(2) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). 4-Biphenylamine is an aromatic amine and aromatic amines in surface waters exposed to sunlight react with photo-oxidants (such as hydroxyl radicals, peroxy radicals and singlet oxygen) with a half-life on the order of 30 days(3). Humic acids in natural water photosensitize the photo-oxidation reaction of aromatic amines such as aniline(4); for example, when aniline in distilled water and aniline in Georgia river water (high in humic acid content) was exposed to sunlight, the respective half-lives were 1 week and 4-8 hours(4). 4-Biphenylamine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(5).[(1) US EPA; Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite.

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Data are limited to an analysis of aromatic amines from cooking oil fumes, which are known to be carcinogenic for bladder cancer. Fume samples from three different commercial cooking oils frequently used in Taiwan were collected and analysed for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome assay. Aromatic amines were extracted from the samples and identified by HPLC and confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Extracts from three cooking oil fumes were found to be mutagenic in the presence of S-9 mix. All samples contained 2-naphthylamine (2-NA) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP). Concentrations of 2-NA and 4-ABP were 31.5 and 35.7 ug/cu m in fumes from sunflower oil, 31.9 and 26.4 mg/cu m in vegetable oil, and 48.3 and 23.3 ug/cu m in refined-lard oil, respectively. Mutagenicities of the three cooking oil condensates were significantly reduced (P<0.05) by adding the antioxidant catechin (CAT) into the oils before heating. Significant difference existed between the amounts of aromatic amines with and without adding CAT (P<0.05). These results indicate that exposure to cooking oil fumes in Taiwan might be an important but controllable risk factor in the aetiology of bladder cancer.",

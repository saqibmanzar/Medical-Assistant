PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

This includes pKa (the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant) and pKb (the negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Materials studied were N-methylethanolamine (MEA), N, N, -dimethylethanolamine (DMEA), N, N, -dimethylisopropanolamine (DMIPA), N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), and tertbutyldiethanolamine (BDEA). All these alkylalkanolamines were of comparable acute peroral toxicity in the rat (LD50 range 1.48-2.83 mL/kg). By 24 hr occluded epicutaneous contact in the rabbit, MEA, DMEA and DMIPA were of moderate acute percutaneous toxicity (LD50 range 1.13-2.0 mL/kg), MDEA was of slight acute percutaneous toxicity (LD50 male 9.85 mL/kg, female 10.90 mL/kg), and BDEA of intermediate toxicity (LD50 6.4 mL/kg). Due to differences in vapor pressure the acute vapor exposure toxicity of the alkylalkanolamines to rats varied; MEA, MDEA and BDEA were of a low order of acute toxicity, and DMIPA was moderately toxic with an LT50 of 3.2 hr for a saturated vapor atmosphere exposure. A 4 hr-LC50 (rat combined sex) of 1461 ppm was determined for DMEA. All alkylalkanolamines studied, except MDEA, were moderately to markedly irritating and caused variable degrees of skin corrosivity; MDEA caused only transient minor skin irritation. In accord with the skin irritancy results, the eye irritancy from 0.005 mL MEA, DMEA, DMIPA and BDEA was severe, and that from MDEA was slight. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.08 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-methylaminoethanol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-methylaminoethanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.9 hours. 2-Methylaminoethanol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-methylaminoethanol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. The pKa of 2-methylaminoethanol is 9.95, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.1X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Methylaminoethanol is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 68% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks classifying the compound as readily biodegradable and suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 2-methylaminoethanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-methylaminoethanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-methylaminoethanol is produced or used. 2-Methylaminoethanol is used only for industrial application and is not sold for direct consumer use.

Volatilization of the neutral species of 2-methylaminoethanol from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.1X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(2). 2-Methylaminoethanol is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.08 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5).

The pKa of 2-methylaminoethanol  is 9.95(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in cation form in the environment, and volatilization from water is unlikely since cations do not volatilize(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of -0.94(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A 68% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test classifies 2-methylaminoethanol as readily biodegradable(7) and suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process(SRC) since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Springer Nature aims to provide only highly qualitative and relevant content but references of lower relevance aren't withheld as they might contain also very useful information.",

It does not occur naturally. Pure disulfoton is a colorless oil with an unidentifiable characteristic odor and taste. The technical product is dark yellowish, with an aromatic odor. Common trade names are Di-syston, Disystox, Frumin AL, and Soilvirex. Use of trade names is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the Public Health Service, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It is used to protect small grains, sorghum, corn, and other field crops; some vegetables, fruit, and nut crops; and ornamental and potted plants against certain insects. Although it is used mostly in agriculture, small quantities are used on home and garden plants, and for mosquito control in swamps. The use of disulfoton has decreased in recent years.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Use of trade names is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the Public Health Service, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It is used to protect small grains, sorghum, corn, and other field crops; some vegetables, fruit, and nut crops; and ornamental and potted plants against certain insects. Although it is used mostly in agriculture, small quantities are used on home and garden plants, and for mosquito control in swamps. The use of disulfoton has decreased in recent years.",

Direct contact with disulfoton may cause burns to  the skin and eyes. Systemic effects from skin absorption, ingestion, or inhalation range from  headache, weakness, and disorientation, to convulsions, coma, and death from respiratory  arrest. The ACGIH TLV of 0.1 mg/cu m serves to limit general room contamination, and thereby  cutaneous exposure as well. Nevertheless, those involved in the manufacture, formulation, and  application of this brownish-to-yellowish, aromatic liquid should assure protection by wearing  goggles, gloves, rubber boots, long sleaved overalls made of a tight fabric or polyvinyl  chloride with tight collars and cuffs, and a respirator with an activated-carbon gas filter  cartridge (or a self-contained breathing apparatus). Strict personal hygiene is equally  important; which includes the prohibition of smoking and eating during work, the thorough  washing with soap after work, the changing to clean clothes before going home, and the routine  washing of contaminated work clothing. Disulfoton will not ignite easily, but it will burn  with the possible production of irritating or poisonous gases. For small fires, extinguish  with dry chemical, CO2, water spray (not a solid stream), fog, or foam, and for large fires,  use water spray, fog, or foam. Wear positive pressure breathing apparatus and protective  clothing. Runoff from fire control water may give off poisonous gases or cause water pollution  and should, therefore, be diked for later disposal. Although oxidizable in air, disulfoton is  stable upon proper storage; with a shelf life at 20 \u00b0C of at least 2 yr. Containers of  disulfoton may be shipped by air, rail, road, or water, and, for both domestic and  international compliance, should be affixed with labels stating, \"Keep Away From Food\", and  \"Poison\". Small liquid spills of disulfoton may be reduced to a solid phase by evaporation,  and then removed by vacuum cleaning. Large land spills should be deposited in excavated pits,  ponds, or holding areas (that, with time permitting have been sealed with an impermeable  flexible membrane liner) and the bulk material absorbed with fly ash or cement powder. Surface  flow should be diked with sand bags or soil. Spills of disulfoton in bodies of water may first  need to be trapped at the bottom with sand bag barriers and treated with activated carbon.  Trapped material is then removed by mechanical lifts or dredges. Before permanent land  disposal of disulfoton, consult with environmental regulatory agencies. In addition to land  disposal, disulfoton is a good candidate for liquid injection, rotary kiln, and fluidized bed  forms of incineration.",

EPA issues an IRED for a pesticide that is undergoing reregistration, requires a  reregistration eligibility decision, and also needs a cumulative assessment under FQPA. The  IRED, issued after EPA completes the individual pesticide's aggregate risk assessment, may  include taking risk reduction measures -- for example, reducing risks to workers or  eliminating uses that the registrant no longer wishes to maintain -- to gain the benefits of  these changes before the final RED can be issued following the Agency's consideration of  cumulative risks.",

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

Remember that atropine can be administered through an endotracheal tube if initial IV access if difficult to obtain. Depending on the severity of poisoning, doses of atropine ranging from very low to as high as 300 mg/day may be required, or even continuous infusion. The objective of atropine antidotal therapy is to antagonize the effects of excessive concentrations of acetylcholine at end-organs having muscarinic receptors. Atropine does not reactivate the cholinesterase enzyme or accelerate disposition of organophosphate. Recrudescence of poisoning may occur if tissue concentrations of organophosphate remain high when the effect of atropine wears off. Atropine is effective against muscarinic manifestations, but it is ineffective against nicotinic actions, specifically muscle weakness and twitching, and respiratory depression. Despite these limitations, atropine is often a life-saving agent in organophosphate poisonings. Favorable response to a test dose of atropine (1 mg in adults, 0.01 mg/kg in children under 12 years) can help differentiate poisoning by anticholinesterase agents from other conditions. However, lack of response, with no evidence of atropinization (atropine refractoriness) is typical of more severe poisonings. The adjunctive use of nebulized atropine has been reported to improve respiratory distress, decrease bronchial secretions, and increase oxygenation. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

Nausea is often the first symptom, followed by vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and excessive salivation (sialorrhea). Hypothermia has been reported in animals and at least once in man as an early sign. 2. Headache, giddiness, vertigo, and weakness. 3. Rhinorrhea and a sensation of tightness in the chest are common in inhalation exposures. 4. Blurring or dimness of vision, miosis (with fixed pinpoint pupils), tears, ciliary muscle spasm, loss of accommodation, and ocular pain. None of these eye effects are diagnostically dependable except in primary ocular exposures. Indeed, mydriasis is sometimes seen, probably due to sympatho-adrenal discharge. 5. Bradycardia or tachycardia. Varying degrees  of AV heart block are described, as well as atrial arrhythmias. 6. Loss of muscle  coordination, slurring of speech, fasciculations and twitching of muscles (particularly of the  tongue and eyelids), and generalized profound weakness. 7. Mental confusion, disorientation, and  drowsiness. 8. Difficulty in breathing, excessive secretion of saliva and of respiratory tract mucus, oronasal frothing, cyanosis, pulmonary rales and rhonchi, and hypertension (presumably due to asphyxia). 9. Random jerky movements, incontinence, convulsions, and coma. 10. Death primarily due to respiratory arrest arising from failure of the respiratory muscles, intense bronchoconstriction, or all three. /Parathion/",

In both R1 cells and isolated hepatocytes, distinct dose- and time-dependent morphological alterations including diminished amounts of heterochromatin, proliferation of lysosomal elements, dilation and vesiculation of endoplasmic reticulum cisternae, induction of concentric membrane whorls and an increased amount of lipid droplets could be detected at concentrations of > or = 2 mg/l (R1 cells) and > or = 0.2 mg/l disulfoton (hepatocytes). Additional effects in isolated hepatocytes comprised marginalization of heterochromatin, myelin-like structures attached to mitochondrial membranes, formation of ring-shaped mitochondria, proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, reduction of rough endoplasmic reticulum, induction of ring-shaped Golgi cisternae, glycogen depletion and occurrence of glycogenosomes. Structural changes in isolated hepatocytes could be correlated to suppression of lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, malic enzyme, esterase as well as glutathione S-transferase, but to a stimulation of 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase and the rate of lipid peroxidation at concentrations > or = 0.01 mg/l disulfoton. Comparison with data from in vivo experiments with rainbow trout indicate the suitability of in vitro techniques for the evaluation of the toxicological potential of a wide range of ecotoxicologically relevant substances.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.75X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates disulfoton will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase disulfoton will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 hrs. Particulate-phase disulfoton will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Disulfoton does not directly photolyze due to the lack of absorption in the environmental UV spectrum (>290 nm). If released to soil, disulfoton is expected to have low to no mobility based upon a Koc range of 684 to 14,013. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Soil microorganisms are capable of converting thioethers to sulfoxides and sulfones. Disulfoton photodegrades in 1-4 days on soil under natural sunlight. If released into water, disulfoton is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Primary biodegradation half-lives of 7 to 41 days were calculated for samples of Rhine River water at the time of the Schweizerhalle, Switzerland chemical spill, November 1986. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 28 and 210 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1,410 days if adsorption is considered. A BCF of 450 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Disulfoton is stable to hydrolysis in water at 20 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to disulfoton may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where disulfoton is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to disulfoton via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food, and dermal contact with this compound. (SRC)",

However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). Disulfoton is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4).

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Aerobic degradation in the field to sulfoxide and sulfotone has been reported(3). However, the observed breakdown of disulfoton in sterile and glucose-amended soil was considered to provide evidence against microbial oxidation(4). Loss of disulfoton in sterilized and unsterilized soil irradiated with sunlight for 1 week was 68-87% and 68-79%, respectively, suggesting that microbial metabolism was not responsible for the loss of disulfoton(1).",

Primary biodegradation half-lives of 7 to 41 days were calculated for samples of Rhine River water collected at the time of the Schweizerhalle, Switzerland chemical spill, November 1986, and inoculated with disulfoton at a concn range of 5-200 ug/l(3). Primary biodegradation was the major removal process for disulfoton from the Rhine River, equating to 12.2-53% reduction of total load (5-20 ug/l) to the system, followed by dilution at 7-41%, and abiotic hydrolysis at 2.2-3.0%(3).",

Loss of disulfoton in sterilized and unsterilized soil irradiated with sunlight for 1 week was 68-87% and 68-79%, respectively(1). A photooxidation half-life of 29 minutes has been reported(6). Disulfoton does not absorb UV light at environmental wavelengths (>290 nm) and does not appear to be susceptible to direct photolysis(2). Humic substances found in soil and water have been shown to photosensitize oxidation of disulfoton(3). Disulfoton undergoes photosensitized oxidation, probably by reaction with singlet oxygen, to its corresponding sulfoxide and sulfone (trace amounts) when adsorbed on soil surfaces and exposed to sunlight (observed half-life approx 1 to 4 days)(2,7). The half-life for photosensitized oxidation of disulfoton to disulfoton sulfoxide by humic substances in distilled water ranges from approximately 4 hours during summer to 11 hours during winter(3). In dilute (100 uM) hydrogen peroxide solution 18% and 53% removal of disulfoton was observed after 125 hours under dark and sunlit conditions, respectively, and in distilled water 11% removal was observed after 125 hours under sunlit conditions(4). Photochemical transformation half-lives of disulfoton in Rhine River water using environmental conditions for November, 1986 were calculated to be 1,000 and 100 days in winter and spring, respectively(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that disulfoton is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 28 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 210 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1,400 days if adsorption is considered(4). Disulfoton's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Disulfoton is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

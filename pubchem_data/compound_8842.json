Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Hydrogenation of nerol and geraniol over a copper chromite catalyst gives a high yield of citronellol. Fractional distillation of the crude product produces a perfumery-quality citronellol. Geraniol can also be hydrogenated selectively to citronellol, without forming tetrahydrogeraniol, through use of a Raney cobalt catalyst. However, partial hydrogenation using a nickel catalyst does give some tetrahydrogeraniol. The product contains nerol, geraniol, and tetrahydrogeraniol and has odor properties closer to materials derived from citronella oil, and is therefore useful as a perfumery material.",

It is registered for pesticide use in the USA but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. It is also used in perfumery. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Adult male volunteers with no known allergic reactions were patch-tested on their back for 48 hr with 32% citronellol. After 48 hr, patches were removed and the skin was cleaned of any residual test material. Moderate irritation was observed. A patch test using a 1% concentration of citronellol in acetone gave a positive reaction in subjects allergic to citronella oil. ANIMAL STUDIES: Citronellol applied full strength to intact or abraded rabbit skin for 24 hr under occlusion was moderately irritating. Severe irritation was observed in rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to 100% compound (unoccluded) for 24, 48 or 72 hr. Citronellol was not mutagenic when tested in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Golden Orfe (Leuciscus idus) were exposed to this chemical under static conditions for 96 hours. No mortalities were seen in the control and 4.64 mg/L groups. At 10 mg/L, apathy was noted up to 24 hr, but no mortalities were noted at 96 hr. At 21.5, 46.4 and 100 mg/L, 100% mortality was seen 1 hour after exposure.",

In 2005, the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) added FM II to their baseline series. /The objective was/ to evaluate reactions to FM II and its constituents in routine patch testing. Retrospective data analysis of the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK), 2005-2008, of patch test results with FM II and its constituents. A total of 35,633 patients were patch tested with FM II as part of the DKG baseline series. Of these, 1742 (4.9%) reacted positively. Concomitant reactions to FM I were observed in 41.9% of the patients reacting to FM II. In 367 FM II-positive patients, a full breakdown test of the mix was performed. Of these, 47.7% reacted to hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, 16.1% to citral, 11.4% to farnesol, 3.8% to hexyl cinnamal, 2.7% to coumarin, and 2.5% to citronellol.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this multicenter study was to map the frequency of CH to FM II and its components in Hungary. METHODS: Six centers participated in the survey from 2009 to 2010. A total off 565 patients (434 women and 131 men) with former skin symptoms provoked by scented products were patch tested. The tests were performed with Brial GmbH D-Greven allergens. In the environmental patch test series, FM II, FM I, Myroxylon pereirae, colophonium, wood-tar mix, propolis, and sesquiterpene lactone mix were tested as fragrance allergens. The FM II components (citral, farnesol, coumarin, citronellol, alpha-hexyl-cinnamaldehyde, and hydroxy-isohexyl-3-cyclohexene-carboxaldehyde [Lyral]) were also tested. RESULTS: Contact hypersenstitivity to any fragrances was detected in 28.8%, to FM II in 17.2% of the patients. Contact hypersenstitivity to hydroxy-isohexyl-3-cyclohexene-carboxaldehyde was observed in 7.3%, to coumarin in 5.1%, to alpha-hexyl-cinnamaldehyde in 3.5%, to citral in 3.4%, to farnesol in 2.5%, and to citronellol in 1.2%. Of the FM II-positive cases, 48.4% showed isolated CH reaction. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of CH to FM II is 17.2% in the tested, selected Hungarian population. The CH to FM II and its components could not have been revealed without the present test materials.",

Its use as a fragrance ingredient in perfumes, soaps, detergents, and other household products will result in its direct release to the environment. Citronellol has been identified as a component of tobacco smoke. Citronellol is found widespread in nature. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.02 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates citronellol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase citronellol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.3 hours. Citronellol is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone and nitrate radicals. The half-lives for the reaction with ozone and nitrate are estimated to be 1.1 hours and 4 minutes respectively. The nitrate radical is the dominant atmospheric oxidant during the night-time in most atmospheric environments, therefore, night-time degradation appears to be a major fate process for citronellol. Citronellol absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, citronellol is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 94. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Even though the vapor pressure is low environmentally at standard temperature and pressure, there is a detectable odor; therefore, citronellol may volatilize from dry soil. Utilizing the OECD 301F test, 80-90% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. Citronellol was also classified as readily biodegradable by the results of the OECD 301C test (modified MITI) where citronellol achieved 65% biodegradation after 28 days. If released into water, citronellol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 and 21 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 177 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Photooxidation may occur in surface waters exposed to sunlight. Occupational exposure to citronellol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where citronellol is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to citronellol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing citronellol.

Volatilization of citronellol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.02 mm Hg(3), and water solubility, 200 mg/L(4). Even though the vapor pressure is low environmentally at standard temperature and pressure, there is a detectable odor; therefore, citronellol may volatilize from dry soil(SRC). An 80-90% of Theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the OECD 301F test(5) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC). Citronellol was also classified as readily biodegradable by the results of the OECD 301C test (modified MITI) with 65% degradation in 4 weeks(6) and by a DOC Method F test (100% biodegradation in 15 days)(6). Citronellol absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.02 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 200 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 and 21 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 177(SRC), from its log Kow of 3.91(7) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). An 80-90% of Theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the OECD 301F test(8) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Citronellol was also classified as readily biodegradable by the results of the OECD 301C test (modified MITI) with 65% degradation in 4 weeks(9) and by a DOC Method F test (100% biodegradation in 15 days)(9). Citronellol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Citronellol is an olefin and olefins in surface waters exposed to sunlight react with photo-oxidants (such as hydroxyl radicals, peroxy radicals and singlet oxygen) with a half-life on the order of 25 days(10).",

Vapor-phase citronellol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.3 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.70X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 24 deg(3). Citronellol is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone and nitrate radicals. The half-life for the reaction with ozone is estimated to be 1.1 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.4X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 24 \u00b0C(3). The half-life for the reaction with nitrate radicals is estimated to be 4 minutes(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.21X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 24 \u00b0C(4). The nitrate radical (NO3) is the dominant atmospheric oxidant during the night-time in most atmospheric environments(5), therefore, night-time degradation appears to be a major fate process for citronellol(SRC). Citronellol absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2.3 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of citronellol with atmospheric ozone has been measured as 2.4X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 24 \u00b0C(1); this corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.1 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). Reaction products with hydroxyl radicals and ozone included acetone, ethanedial, and 2-oxopropanal(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of citronellol with atmospheric nitrate radicals has been measured as 1.21X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 24 \u00b0C(3); this corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 4 minutes(SRC) at an atmospheric concentration of 2.5X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(4). The nitrate radical (NO3) is the dominant atmospheric oxidant during the night-time in most atmospheric environments(5), therefore, night-time degradation appears to be a major fate process for citronellol(SRC). Citronellol absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Citronellol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(7). Citronellol is an olefin and olefins in surface waters exposed to sunlight react with photo-oxidants (such as hydroxyl radicals, peroxy radicals and singlet oxygen) with a half-life on the order of 25 days(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that citronellol is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 2.4 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 21 days(SRC). Citronellol's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Even though the vapor pressure is low environmentally at standard temperature and pressure, there is a detectable odor; therefore, citronellol may volatilize from dry soil(SRC). Patch testing to determine the evaporation rate of fragrance chemicals from skin found that citronellol evaporation was not sensitive to pH changes from 4.0 to 7.0 and that 26-27% of applied citronellol was lost within 40 minutes to 24 hours(4).",

Although a large number of postulated metabolites produced negative results in genotoxicity tests, it was noted that only a few of these had been either identified or quantified in rats and pigs. Insufficient data were available on the nature and toxic potential of compounds released from the bound residues. Because of the genotoxic and carcinogenic nature of furazolidone and lack of sufficient data on the metabolites, the Committee was unable to establish an ADI.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

In both systems we determined the frequency of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCE), the cell proliferation kinetics (CPK), and the mitotic index (MI). The in vitro results showed a significant SCE increase starting from the second dose tested and a CPK and MI decrease starting from the third dose. The in vivo results showed a SCE increase with the two high doses tested, but no significant modification was found in the CPK and MI with the three doses tested in the experiment.",

The formation of N-(5-amino-2-furfurylidene)-3-amino-2-oxazolidone as a minor metabolite of nitrofuran in a milk xanthine oxidase system was demonstrated. The aminofuran derivative was easily degraded by milk xanthine oxidase under aerobic, but not anaerobic, conditions. The degradation appears to be due to superoxide anion radicals, hydroxy radicals and/or singlet O2, which are produced in this enzyme system. (Furazolidone, an antibacterial nitrofuran widely used as a veterinary medicine, was mutagenic in Escherichia coli WP2 and Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and tumorigenic in rats).",

For example, nitroheterocyclics such as furazolidone (FZ) induce asymmetric defects in rat embryos in vitro. Potential mechanisms include asymmetric drug delivery; intrinsic difference between the cells of the left and right limbs; physiological asymmetry (e.g. in tissue oxygen), secondary to another primary asymmetry (e.g. in limb vasculature). In one series of experiments, we have investigated the role of an asymmetry in drug delivery and/or tissue oxygen. 10.3 days embryonic age rat embryos were explanted and cultured for two hours to allow 'recovery'. Embryos were then exteriorised (removal from yolk sac and amnion, retaining intact circulation) and cultured in the presence of 20 uM FZ with 5% O2 for 24h. The assumption was that exteriorisation would abolish any drug delivery or tissue oxygen asymmetry, by direct embryonic exposure to the medium. As previously described, FZ induced right sided defects (limb, eye and fore-brain) in 42% of intact yolk sac embryos. In contrast, exposure of exteriorised embryos to FZ induced a 34% incidence of abnormalities which were identical, but exclusively left sided. The results do not support a simple hypothesis that asymmetric drug delivery or tissue oxygen levels are responsible for the unilateral defects. We are investigating two potential explanations: a) Exteriorisation specifically reverses limb bud susceptibility, b) A secondary asymmetry e.g. mitochondrial maturity is altered by exteriorisation which then acts to invert the limb response. In a second series of experiments, we have also investigated a possible primary asymmetry in the development of the limb vasculature, using whole mount in situ hybridisation with a probe specific for early endothelial cell precursors (flk-1). The results are being analysed using confocal microscopy to image the limb vascular architecture.",

Patch testing of the patient revealed contact allergy to an animal feed additive and to a veterinary pharmaceutical, both having furazolidone (67458) as the only common ingredient. Subsequent patch testing with 2% furazolidone in petrolatum vehicle gave completely negative results, but patch testing with 2% furazolidone in polyethylene-glycol (PEG-400) and in alcohol produced positive reactions. No cross reactions were observed to nitrofurazone, nitrofurantoin, or furfural. A review was presented on reported contact allergies to furazolidone, other nitrofuran derivatives, and furfural. Also reviewed were cross reactions between nitrofurazone, furazolidone, and nifurprazine. The authors conclude that PEG-400 is preferable to petrolatum for patch testing of furazolidone.",

A pig farmer with a 6 month history of severe dermatitis on the thumb and middle and ring fingers on both hands was evaluated. Because the patient had indicated that one of his duties was to dose newborn piglets with an oral antibiotic from a pump dispenser, patch testing was performed with samples of the pig feed constituents and the antibiotic dispenser as well as the European standard allergen series. Positive reactions were elicited by patches containing 1 and 10% furazolidone in petrolatum. Samples of the dispenser which contained furazolidone at the time of testing also induced positive responses. When the antibiotic was changed, the patient's dermatitis cleared. The problem of furazolidone and other antibiotic induced sensitivity in pig farmers was discussed. Pig farmers are exposed to a wide range of antibiotics in feeds to promote growth and to prevent infection and also as oral and systemic formulations. Practitioners should be aware of the risk of farmers developing contact dermatitis from antibiotics in feeds and medicines. 3",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.6X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates furazolidone will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase furazolidone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 hrs. Particulate-phase furazolidone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Field studies showed that furazolidone was unstable in light when dissolved in seawater in quartz tubes and exposed for 20 days. If released to soil, furazolidone is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 570. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.3Xl0-11 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, furazolidone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation may be an important fate process in water as the compound was degraded in aquaculture sediments; the main metabolite was 3-(4-cyano-2-oxybutylidene-amino)-2-oxazolidone. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to furazolidone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where furazolidone is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.3X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of -0.04(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

Vapor-phase furazolidone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.6X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase furazolidone may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Field studies conducted during October and November, 1992 in Bergen, Norway showed that furazolidone was unstable in light when dissolved in seawater in quartz tubes and exposed for 20 days(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

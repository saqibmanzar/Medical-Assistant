The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.4X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tris(2,6-xylenyl)phosphate will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase tris(2,6-xylenyl)phosphate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, tris(2,6-xylenyl)phosphate is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 1.1X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.2X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Tris(2,6-xylenyl)phosphate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation of aryl phosphates may occur slowly in the environment based on activated sludge tests showing 13 to 65% biodegradation of trixylenyl phosphate over 14 and 25 weeks, respectively. Under alkaline conditions in soil and water environments, appreciable abiotic degradation may occur via hydrolysis. If released into water, tris(2,6-xylenyl)phosphate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 720 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Occupational exposure to tris(2,6-xylenyl)phosphate may occur through inhalation of dust particles and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tris(2,6-xylenyl)phosphate is produced or used.

Kronitex TXP is a commercial product primarily consisting of the 2,5-, 3,4-, 3,5- and/or the 2,4-isomers of trixylylphosphates along with mixes of xylenyl phosphates or xylenyl/ethylphenyl phosphates(2). The degradation of specific isomers within the mixture was not quantified(1). In general the biodegradability of triaryl phosphates decreases with increasing number and size of substituent groups on the phenolic ring(1,3).

The actual BCF of tris(2,6-xylenyl)phosphate would be expected to be slightly higher, for a greater Kow value would be anticipated for tris(2,6-xylenyl)phosphate due to the presence of lower molecular weight constituents among the TXP mixture. This is in keeping with this class of chemicals as analogous tri-p-cresyl phosphate has measured BCFs of 1,420 and 928 in rainbow trout and fathead minnows, respectively(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

                                "Description": "Attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectral data.  ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Other conjugated metabolites were beta-tetralol (25.3%), 4-hydroxy-alpha-tetralone (6.1%), and cis-tetralin-1,2-diol (0.4%). Using rat liver homogenates, it was shown that conversion of tetralin to tetralol requires reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and that tetralin hydroperoxide is a probable intermediate. Further study confirmed this possibility and indicated that tetralin hydroxylation proceeds via a radical mechanism similar to that of lipid peroxidation.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

It is also released to the environment in effluents from several industrial sources. If released to the atmosphere, tetralin will exist in the vapor phase. Vapor phase tetralin is rapidly degraded by photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of 11 hrs) during the day-time and nitrate radicals (half-life of 3.6 days) during the night-time. If released to soil, tetralin may adsorb strongly (estimated Koc of about 1,800). If released to water, it will adsorb to sediment and suspended matter and will partition from the water column to sediment. Tetralin will bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms that cannot metabolize it. Volatilization from water is fast (estimated half life of 4 hours from a model river) when adsorption does not take place. Some biodegradation studies suggest that biodegradation may be fast with half-lives of 4-13 days. Exposure of the general population may occur through dermal contact and inhalation of contaminated air and may occur during its use as a replacement for turpentine especially in shoe polish and floor wax. Workers may also be exposed to tetralin via inhalation and dermal contact. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a suggested classification scheme(1), volatilization from water will be significant. Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep flowing 1 m/sec with a wind velocity of 3 m/sec) can be estimated to be about 4 hours(1,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 meter deep) can be estimated to be about 5 days(1,SRC). Tetralin exhibited a half-life attributed to volatilization of 8.5 days in a mesocosm containing 13 cu-m Narragansett seawater poisoned with HgCl2 to retard biological activity(3).",

Tetralin was detected at a concn range of 2-58 ug/mL in 5 incinerator effluent extracts(3). Tetralin was detected 1 km from a Volvo assembly plant in Goteborg, Sweden at a concn of 4.6 ug/cu-m on January 14, 1981; regional Goteburg air contains less than 0.01 ug/cu-m tetralin(4). Also, 30 ug/cu-m tetralin was detected in air nearby a Saab assembly plant in Sweden on January 19, 1981(4). These data suggest tetralin is released from automobile assembly plants in emissions from solvents used during painting processes(4). Tetralin emission rates from well-tuned radiant and maltuned convective kerosene space heaters ranged from 100-240 ng/kJ(5).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This was attributed to conversion of the cyanuric acid impurity (3%) to nitrogen trichloride and spontaneous explosion of the latter. During interaction of chlorine and alkylthiouronium salts to give alkanesulfonyl chlorides, the dangerously explosive trichloride may be produced if excess chlorine or slow chlorination is used. ...

In the course of the investigation, cyanuric acid was identified in addition to melamine in the offending food. The purpose of this study was to characterize the toxicity potential of melamine, cyanuric acid, and a combination of melamine and cyanuric acid in cats. In this pilot study, melamine was added to the diet of 2 cats at 0.5% and 1%, respectively. Cyanuric acid was added to the diet of 1 cat at increasing doses of 0.2%, 0.5%, and 1% over the course of 10 days. Melamine and cyanuric acid were administered together at 0%, 0.2%, 0.5%, and 1% to 1 cat per dose group. No effect on renal function was observed in cats fed with melamine or cyanuric acid alone. Cats dosed with a combination were euthanized at 48 hours after dosing because of acute renal failure. Urine and touch impressions of kidneys from all cats dosed with the combination revealed the presence of fan-shaped, birefringent crystals. Histopathologic findings were limited to the kidneys and included crystals primarily within tubules of the distal nephron, severe renal interstitial edema, and hemorrhage at the corticomedullary junction. The kidneys contained estimated melamine concentrations of 496 to 734 mg/kg wet weight and estimated cyanuric acid concentrations of 487 to 690 mg/kg wet weight. The results demonstrate that the combination of melamine and cyanuric acid is responsible for acute renal failure in cats.",

Its former use as a herbicide resulted in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.41X10-11 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cyanuric acid will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase cyanuric acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Cyanuric acid does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, cyanuric acid is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 58. The pKa of cyanuric acid is 6.88, indicating that this compound will partially exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.7X10-15 atm-cu m/mole. Cyanuric acid biodegrades readily under a wide variety of natural conditions, and particularly well in systems of either low or zero dissolved- oxygen levels, such as anaerobic activated sludge and sewage, soils, muds, and muddy streams and river waters, as well as ordinary aerated activated sludge systems with typically low (1 to 3 ppm) dissolved-oxygen levels. If released into water, cyanuric acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. BCF values of <0.5 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to cyanuric acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyanuric acid is produced or used.  (SRC)",

The pKa of cyanuric acid is 6.88(4), indicating that this compound will partially exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5).  Volatilization of cyanuric acid from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.74X10-15 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(6). Cyanuric acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 4.4X10-11 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(7). Cyanuric acid biodegrades readily under a wide variety of natural conditions, and particularly well in systems of either low or zero dissolved- oxygen levels, such as anaerobic activated sludge and sewage, soils, muds, and muddy streams and river waters, as well as ordinary aerated activated sludge systems with typically low (1 to 3 ppm) dissolved-oxygen levels(8).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.7X10-15 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), BCF values of <0.5(6), suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Cyanuric acid biodegrades readily under a wide variety of natural conditions, and particularly well in systems of either low or zero dissolved- oxygen levels, such as anaerobic activated sludge and sewage, soils, muds, and muddy streams and river waters, as well as ordinary aerated activated sludge systems with typically low (1 to 3 ppm) dissolved-oxygen levels(7).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

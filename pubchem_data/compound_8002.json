They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

S-Butyl GSH conjugates were detected in spleen from 6 hr after treatment.

The test substance was administered once orally by gavage to fasted male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Dosage and mortality data are as follows: 1000 mg/kg (0/5 M, 0/5 F); 1967.9 mg/kg (0/5 M, 0/5 F); 3872.6 mg/kg (5/5 M, 4/5 F); 7620.8 mg/kg (5/5 M, 5/5 F); and 15,000 mg/kg (5/5 M, 5/5 F). The LD50 of male rats was determined to be 2761 mg/kg body weight, and the LD50 of females was 3161 mg/kg body weight. Clinical signs at all dose levels, included slight depression, rough coat, tremors, and red stain on eyes and/or nose. At 1967.9 mg/kg and above, soft feces, ataxia, labored respiration, and urine stains were noted. At 3872.6 mg/kg and 7620.8 mg/kg, salvation, lacrimation, prostration, and hunching were noted. Gross pathology at 3872.6 mg/kg and above, revealed bright red discoloration of the lungs, fluid in the thoracic cavity, dark-black urinary bladder, and material in the stomach and intestine (dark red, greenish, oily black, compound-like).",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 42.0 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-butyl bromide will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-butyl bromide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.4 days. 1-Bromobutane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, n-butyl bromide is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 80. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.7X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Bromobutane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 1-bromobutane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Only limited pure culture data on the biodegradation of 1-bromobutane were found; it was found to degrade in sediment slurry under anaerobic conditions and bacterial degradation has been observed under aerobic conditions. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 hours and 4.7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 26 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 1-Bromobutane is expected to hydrolyze quickly based on neutral hydrolysis half-lives of similar compounds such as n-propyl bromide (26 days). Occupational exposure to 1-bromobutane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-bromobutane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-bromobutane via ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

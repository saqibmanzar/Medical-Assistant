PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

All animals were necropsied at the end of the 4 week exposure period. Body weight, feed consumption, clinical signs, clinical chemistry, hematology, organ weight, and histopathologic evaluations were performed on all animals during this study. The only treatment related signs of toxicity observed were inactivity, lacrimation, eye squinting, and labored breathing. These signs were observed sporadically during exposure throughout the study in rats exposed to 952 or 1981 ppm n-BMA. Body weights and feed consumption were not affected by exposure to BMA. No deaths occurred at any concentration. At necropsy the only organ weight effect was a statistical increase in kidney weight to body weight ratio at 1981 ppm in males and females. However, the absolute kidney weights for this group were not statistically significantly increased. Therefore, in the absence of corresponding histologic effects, hematology, or clinical chemistry findings, this increase in relative kidney weight was judged as not being of toxicological significance. Macroscopic examination of the nasal cavaties of the male and female rats exposed to 1981 ppm had slight and localized bilateral degeneration of the olfactory epithelium lining of the dorsal meati. One male and one female rat exposed to 952 ppm had similar changes in the olfactory epithelium. Rats exposed to 310 ppm had no exposure related nasal cavity macroscopic changes. On the basis of the most sensitive indicator of toxicity, the histopathologic changes seen in the nasal cavaties, the LOEL was 952 ppm and the NOEL was 310 ppm."

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.12 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-butyl methacrylate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-butyl methacrylate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 17 hours and 1 day, respectively. n-Butyl methacrylate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, n-butyl methacrylate is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 55. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.0X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. n-Butyl methacrylate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 88% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, n-butyl methacrylate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.6 hours and 5.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 37 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 80 and 8 years at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to n-butyl methacrylate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-butyl methacrylate is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-butyl methacrylate via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing n-butyl methacrylate. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.6 hours and 5.4 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 37(SRC), from its log Kow of 2.88(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process(SRC) based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 80 and 8 years at pHs 7 and 8, respectively(9). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 88% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks(10) indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

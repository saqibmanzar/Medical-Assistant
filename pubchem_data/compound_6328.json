When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Acute inhalation exposure of humans to methyl iodide has resulted in nausea, vomiting, vertigo, ataxia, slurred speech, drowsiness, skin blistering, and eye irritation. Chronic (long-term) exposure of humans to methyl iodide by inhalation may affect the CNS and cause skin burns. EPA has not classified methyl iodide for potential carcinogenicity.",

AEGLs are used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures.  AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Respirators may also be used for operations which require entry into tanks or closed vessels, and in emergency situations. If the use of respirators is necessary, the only respirators permitted are those that have been approved by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (formerly Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration) or by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. In addition to respirator selection, a complete respiratory protection program should be instituted which includes regular training, maintenance, inspection, cleaning, and evaluation."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Excretion of sulfhydryl in bile was not influenced by S-methylcysteine, S-methylthiol, S-methyl-N-acetylpenicillamine or a low dose of iodomethane (0.5 mmol/kg). This indicated that coupling of methylmercury to glutathione in the liver before biliary excretion was glutathione S-transferase-dependent reaction and the methylthiols tested, or metabolites of these compounds were likely to be inhibitors of S-transferase. The effect of S-methylcysteine and low doses of iodomethane (1 mmol/kg) seem to deplete the liver of reduced glutathione through S-methylation as illustrated by decreased biliary excretion of sulfhydryl.",

Anthropogenic sources of methyl iodide resulting from its use as a methylating agent are minor compared with biogenic ones. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 405 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl iodide will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Methyl iodide will degrade in the atmosphere primarily as a result of photolysis. Its photolytic half-life is 2.8 to 5.5 days. By comparison, its half-life as a result of reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals is about is about 220 days. If released to soil, methyl iodide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 14. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.00526 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl iodide should volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Ninety-four percent of methyl iodide applied 30 cm below the surface of a soil column was lost through volatilization. Abiotic degradation will occur as a result of hydrolysis and reaction with nucleophilic ions such as chloride ions. The half-life of methyl iodide in soils that were rich in organic matter was 9-13 days, while in a sandy loam soil it was 42-63 days. If released into water, methyl iodide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.3 hours and 4.8 days, respectively. Methyl iodide hydrolyzes slowly in water with a half-life of 110-251 days at 20-25 \u00b0C in fresh water. In seawater, it reacts with chloride ions and has a half-life of 20 and 58 days at 19.2 and 10.8 \u00b0C, respectively. An estimated BCF of 2.9 suggests that the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methyl iodide from the ambient air and from ingesting seafood from the ocean. (SRC)",

Methyl iodide production rates of varieties of brown (both kelps and nonkelps), red and green marine microalgae have been measured in the laboratory and estimates of oceanic production of methyl iodide made from these production rates(3). As with previous extrapolations, methyl iodide production rates fail to account for estimated oceanic strengths of the chemical. It is suggested that indirect production of methyl iodide via microbial decay of seaweed iodocarbons may fill this gap(3). However, another investigator pointed out that this additional source is much too small(4). Another explanation is that the results of halocarbon production by algae in the laboratory cannot be extended to natural mixed populations. In addition to oceanic emissions, biomass burning has been identified as a minor secondary source of methyl iodide(2).",

Volatilization of methyl iodide from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 0.00526 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C(3). The potential for volatilization of methyl iodide from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon a vapor pressure of 405 mm Hg(4). Cumulative volatilization losses of methyl iodide, applied at 30 cm, from 60-cm soil columns packed with a sandy loam soil ranged from 94% when the soil was untarped to 75% with a high-barrier tarp(5). Volatilization losses were significantly lower, 38% and 53%, from soils high in organic matter and capable of rapidly degrading the chemical. Ten days after methyl iodide was applied to field plots (30 cm depth) covered with a polyethylene film, methyl iodide was detected at most depths(5). It was concluded that should the water table be shallow and the degradation rate in soil low, methyl iodide may leach into ground water(5). Methyl iodide abiotically degrades in soil by hydrolysis and reaction with chloride ions, HS- and other nucleophiles(6). The half-life of methyl iodide in soils that were rich in organic matter was 9-13 days, while in a sandy loam soil it was 42-63 days. The organic-rich soils were thought to contain more nucleophiles with which methyl iodide could react(6).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.00526 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.3 hours and 4.8 days, respectively(SRC). Methyl iodide hydrolyses slowly in water with a half-life of 110-251 days at 20-25 \u00b0C(8,9). It reacts with chloride ions in seawater in which its half-life is 20 and 58 days at 19.2 and 10.8 \u00b0C, respectively(8). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 2.9(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.51(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.",

Vapor-phase methyl iodide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 220 days(SRC), from its rate constant of 7.20X10-14 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). However the major loss process for methyl iodide in the atmosphere is direct photolysis. The half-life of this reaction is 2.8-5.5 days(3,4). Physical removal of methyl iodide from air may occur via wet deposition since methyl iodide is relatively soluble in water(SRC).",

The half-life under neutral conditions is 110-251 days at 20-25 \u00b0C(1,2), increasing to 4 yr and 23 yr at 10 and 0 \u00b0C respectively(1). More recent measurements yielded a unimolecular hydrolysis rate constant of 7.1X10-8 1/sec at 25 \u00b0C(6). This is equivalent to a half-life of 110 days(SRC). A base-catalyzed reaction is only important at higher pH's than are observed in the environment(2). However, methyl iodide is unstable in seawater, reacting primarily with the chloride ion to form methyl chloride(1). The half-life in seawater of 19.8 parts/thousand chlorinity is 20 and 58 days at 19.2 and 10.8 \u00b0C, respectively(1). More recent studies of the reaction of chloride with methyl iodide reports rate constants for both seawater (33.3 parts/thousand chlorinity) and 0.5 M NaCl in distilled water of 1.0X10-6 L/mol-sec(7). The rate in NaCl corresponds to a half-life of 16 days. Methyl iodide absorbs UV radiation up to approximately 340 nm and photolyses(3). Photolysis occurs in both the gas phase and in solution. In water photohydrolysis occurs forming methanol and iodide ions; in air, iodine is formed(8). When irradiated in pure air (relative humidity 50%), methyl iodide's half-life was 7 hr(4); with added NO2 its half-life was a little over 3 hr(5). The dissipation half-life of methyl iodide from open surface water (30 cm-deep tank) with sunlight irradiation was 26 hours compared with 29 hours indoors. At the end of 6 days, 3.1% of the methyl iodide was recovered as I-; no iodine was detected(8). It was concluded that photodegradation was a minor loss mechanism compared with volatilization.",

The major reaction pathway should give rise to CH2I radicals and water(2). A pathway leading to the formation of CH3 radicals and HOI is expected to occur, but to a lesser extent(2). The reaction of methyl iodide with hydroxyl radicals is low compared with the photolysis of methyl iodide, whose half-life of 2.8-5.5 days(2,3). Therefore reaction with hydroxyl radicals is a minor tropospheric process compared with photolysis. The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of methyl iodide with nitrate radicals is 1.92X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at room temperature(4).

The hydrolysis rate of methyl iodide in water can be increased by the presence of sulfur nucleophiles(3); the increase is dependent on the nucleophile concn(3). Reaction with HS- has been suggested as an important removal pathway of methyl iodide from a salt marsh(5). The reaction of methyl iodide with dissolved or metal-bound sulfide represents a potential source of environmental dimethyl sulfide(4). Photolysis studies showed that direct photolysis is not as fast in seawater as the SN2 reaction with chloride ion(1); at 29 \u00b0C, the half-life in dark seawater control tubes was 7.8 days while in tubes exposed to Miami sunlight, the half-life was 6.2 days(1); the SN reaction half-life with chloride ion varies dramatically with ocean latitude and depth with half-lives ranging from 6 days in the warmest water to thousands of days in the coldest waters(1). The degradation of methyl iodide in soils was not markedly affected by sterilization implying that degradation occurred by chemical mechanisms(5). The fact that degradation was considerably faster in organic matter-rich soils suggests that other reactions, probably with nucleophilic functional groups, are involved. The half-life in soils that were rich in organic matter was 9-13 days, while in a sandy loam soil it was 42-63 days.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that methyl iodide should volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 1.3 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4.8 days(SRC). The Henry's Law constant in seawater of salinity 30.4 g dissolved inorganic matter/kg seawater was 0.00354 atm-cu m/mole at 20 \u00b0C(4) indicating a lower volatization rate for methyl iodide in seawater(SRC). Dissipation of methyl iodide from open surface water was found to be primarily a result of volatilization(4). Experiments conducted under indoor conditions resulted in a first-order half-life of 29 hours under static conditions and 6.5 hours when stirred at low speed with a magnetic stirrer(5). After 6 days, less that 1% of the methyl iodide was detected as iodide ion. Methyl iodide's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Methyl iodide is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 405 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(3).",

Concns of methyl iodide (parts/trillion) recorded during cruises (location/date, mean, range of concn): Western Pacific (n=48) - Sept-Oct. 1992, 0.87, 0.05-5.0; Eastern and southeast Asian seas (n=73) - Jan-Mar, 1994, 0.63, 0.24-2.0(6). 1994 winter measurements and 1991 summer measurements of methyl iodide were taken over the western Pacific basin. At latitudes >25 deg N, concns were typically between 0.4 and 0.8 parts/trillion(7). By contrast, concns were significantly lower in winter, remaining between 0.2 and 0.4 parts/trillion. Maximum concns in both seasons were below 3 km altitude. URBAN/SUBURBAN: US - 561 samples 3.5 parts/trillion median, 80 part/trillion max(1). USEPA Volatile Organics Data Base: Mean concns (parts/trillion): 7 (suburban), 2 (urban)(5). The following mean (range) concns (parts/trillion) of methyl iodide were monitored in the air of various US cities between 1983 and 1985(2): Philadelphia, PA, 3; Staten Island, NY, 5; Houston, TX, 12 (11-48); Downey, CA, 3 (<1-10); Denver, CO, 2 (1-8); San Jose, CA, 3-9 (<1-51)(2,4). Except for some measurements at Houston and under stagnant conditions in San Jose, methyl iodide concns were indistinguishable from natural background levels(2). Levels most frequently measurable in close proximity to the ocean were consistent with the suggestion that its origins are in the ocean(3). No significant man-made sources are known to exist(2).",

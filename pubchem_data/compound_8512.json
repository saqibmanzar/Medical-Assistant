When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Modern ultraviolet spectrophotometers also cover the visible light range, in which case the technique is called ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.09X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-hydroxyanthraquinone will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-hydroxyanthraquinone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 28 hrs. Particulate-phase 1-hydroxyanthraquinone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 1-Hydroxyanthraquinone isomers photodecompose under irradiation with visible light in aerated alkaline solution, with phthalic acid as the main product. If released to soil, 1-hydroxyanthraquinone is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.2X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on a 1-5% theoretical BOD using activated sludge and the Japanese MITI test. However, in most anoxic sediments, uncharged simple anthraquinone dyes exhibit half-lives of less than 10 days. If released into water, 1-hydroxyanthraquinone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF range of 55-297 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since 1-hydroxyanthraquinone is no longer produced or used. (SRC)",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

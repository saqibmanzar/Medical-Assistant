When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Methylation is catalysed by thiopurine methyltransferase in the cytoplasm and thiol methyltransferase in microsomes, and both reactions require S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl group donor. Thiopurine methyltransferase is present in human liver, kidney, and erythrocytes; preferential substrates for this enzyme include aromatic and heterocyclic thiols. S-Methylation of aliphatic thiols is catalysed by microsomal thiol methyltransferase, and the resulting methyl thioether (sulfide) metabolite would undergo S-oxidation to give the methyl sulfoxide and methyl sulfone analogues as urinary products. Thiols may react with glutathione and other endogenous thiol substances to form mixed disulfides. Both microsomal and cytoplasmic thioltransferasess have been reported to catalyse the formation of mixed disulfides. The resulting mixed disulfides can undergo reduction back to thiols, oxidative desulfuration, or oxidation to a sulfonic acid via the intermediate thiosulfinate and sulfinic acids. The principal form in the circulation would probably be a mixed disulfide formed with albumin. /Simple thiols/",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

                                                    "String": "/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ A variety of mercaptans, especially the beta-mercaptocarboxylic acids, inhibited the selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase activity of chick liver postmitochondrial supernatant or cytosol and of purified bovine erythrocyte selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase. The effects of mercaptans and a glutathione analogue on selenium utilization were determined by subcutaneous injection of test compounds into vitamin E deficient chicks fed diets containing 0.1 ppm selenium (as Na2SeO3) at times when greater than 50% of vitamin E and selenium deficient chicks showed the vitamin E , selenium deficiency disease exudative diathesis. D-(-)-Penicillamine hydrochloride (the positive control model compound), sodium beta-mercaptopyruvate, t-butyl mercaptan and S-methylglutathione (nonmercaptan glutathione analogue) decreased selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase activity in chick liver postmitochondrial supernatants within 24 hr of injection and increased the incidence of exudative diathesis within 4 days. Other mercaptans tested did not increase exudative diathesis incidence or affect liver, kidney or plasma selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase activities. Although mercaptosuccinic acid, N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine and sodium thioglycolate each strongly inhibited selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase activity in vitro, each also significantly increased chick mortality in the dosage range tested; therefore, their effects on selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase activity in vivo could not be evaluated. It appears that the beta-mercaptocarboxylic acids, mercaptans with a high degree of steric hindrance in close proximity to the thiol group and a close structural analogue of glutathione, are capable of altering selenium status in chicks.",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 181 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates t-butyl mercaptan will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase t-butyl mercaptan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours. t-Butyl mercaptan does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, t-butyl mercaptan is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 49. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.1X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. t-Butyl mercaptan may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, t-butyl mercaptan is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation data were not available. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to t-butyl mercaptan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where t-butyl mercaptan is produced or used. Use data suggest that general population exposure may occur via inhalation of ambient air near natural gas refineries and operations due to use as a natural gas odorant. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Natural gas containing 0.5 lb of t-butyl mercaptan per million cubic feet was passed through a bed of pulverized, dry, raw montmorillonite clay and then measured for loss of odorant.

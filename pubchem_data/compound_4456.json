PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Protein synthesis in these cultures was markedly reduced and cell morphology degenerated. Myotubes maintained slightly hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials, and were able to respond to iontophoretic acetylcholine (Ach) application with overshooting action potentials. Degenerative changes at the neuromuscular junction associated with chronic neostigmine treatment in vivo are probably due to a direct action of the anticholinesterase on the muscle, rather than to altered intracleft ACh levels or to presynaptic effects of the anticholinesterase.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

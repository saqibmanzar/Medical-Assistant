When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as solvent, artificial fingernail glue remover; in organic syntheses. It is also used experimentally as liquid propellant. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Adverse effects resulting from human exposure to nitroethane have been primarily through accidental ingestion of artificial nail remover products by children. Methemoglobinemia results from accidental oral exposure and can be successfully treated with iv methylene blue therapy. Because methemoglobinemia may be delayed, individuals who ingest nitroethane should be monitored closely for at lease 24 hours after ingestion. if nitroethane is spilled on clothing and allowed to remain, it may cause smarting and reddening of skin. If inhaled will cause coughing or difficult breathing. Liquid: if swallowed will cause nausea and vomiting. Inhalation causes moderate irritation of respiratory tract. Ingestion causes irritation of mouth and stomach. ANIMAL STUDIES: Nitroethane was considered less toxic to rats ip or by inhalation than 1- and 2-nitropropanes. Even in cases of acute intoxication, only low levels of methemoglobin were induced by nitroethane. The 2 year study in male and female rats found no biologically significant effects of nitroethane exposure on organ weights, and no significant difference in the nonneoplastic or neoplastic pathology related to exposure to nitroethane. Developmental study in mice found no effect on the dams and there was no evidence of nitroethane-induced terata, variation in sex ratio, embryotoxicity or inhibition of fetal growth and development. Negative results were obtained from studies of nitroethane in Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian microsome (Ames) test (with and without microsomal activation), and in an in vivo mutagenic (micronucleus) test.",

All animals exposed to the higher doses showed lacrimation and conjunctival discharge, dyspnea and, in some rabbits, audible rales. Conjunctival and respiratory tract irritation were evident early during exposure. At necropsy, marked acute pulmonary congestion with edema was a notable finding, however, it was not sufficient alone to account for death. In 2 animals exposed by inhalation, hemorrhage of the anterior turbinates was seen. Nitroethane caused significant cerebral congestion and edema. Some degree of liver damage was evident in all animals exposed to large nitroethane conc, regardless of the route of administration. Necrosis and fatty degeneration of the liver were common pathological findings. Changes in the kidneys consisted of edema, pallor and cloudy swelling. Application of nitroethane to the skin produced no injuries or deaths and no significant pathological changes.",

At 3 months, 2 each male and female, treated and control rats were given hematological and blood chemistry tests, and were then sacrificed for evaluation of gross or histological changes related to treatment. Other than insignificant depressions in hemoglobin in treated male and female rats and hematocrit in treated males relative to controls, no clinical findings were reported in exposed rats. Blood chemistry determinations for treated rats were comparable to controls at 3-month evaluation. Upon necropsy, a solitary hemangioendothelioma metastasized to regional lymph nodes was observed in a solitary treated male. This observation, unprecedented in historical controls, prompted further investigation of remaining animals with subsequent examinations at 977 hours and again at 1203 hours. No further tumors were noted, however study authors expressed concern relative to this solitary occurrence in a treated rat and plans for study of chronic inhalation exposure to 20 ppm in rats.",

Treatment applied to 20 cm x cm intact dermal sites under occluded patch was removed 12 hours later and unabsorbed radioactivity in the occlusive patch and cleansing materials was assayed. Blood samples, urine and feces were collected during the 72 hours following treatment and were assayed for radioactivity, as were excised application sites and the adjacent (1 cm) skin and subcutaneous fat tissues at 72 hours. Both treated and untreated skin samples were examined histologically. No overt toxicity including dermal irritation was reported in either animal. Feed and water ingestion were normal throughout 72-hour post-treatment observation and bodyweights remained static. Of the total dose, an average 0.117% or 16.20 ug nitroethane was recovered in excreta within 72 hours of which 77.2% was in collected urine and 22.8% was in fecal samples. The majority (91.4%) of urine radioactivity was collected 48 hours after treatment. Average maximal blood concentrations (41.3 ppb and 16.5 ppb) were attained for respective monkeys at 40 minutes and 1 hour post-treatment. At 4 hours, all traces of radioactivity were gone from the blood. Negligible amounts of the dermal nitroethane doses were recovered in excised skin (0.029%) and subcutaneous fat (far below 0.001%) at 72 hours. The soap/water and acetone swabs from 12-hour cleansing of dermal applications contained 0.021% of the total nitroethane doses and 0.041% was recovered in the occlusive patch. Study authors noted a marked loss (99.79% average in 2 monkeys) of the total nitroethane dose, likely attributable to a very high volatility of the test material and despite an occluded application. Additionally, these data did not account for exhaled radioactivity (nitroethane or the volatile metabolites). These criteria did, however, establish low dermal absorption under the conditions of this study.",

Dermal irritation was quantified with erythema and edema indices according to the method of Draize at 24 and 48 hours following the initial injection. Two weeks following induction, or 42 days after the initial injection, control and inducted guinea pigs were challenged intradermally with 0.1 mL at a virgin site. Induction with 10% nitroethane was characterized by inflammatory erythema and edema upon a first injection, as it was upon 2nd and 3rd injections. Protocol was thus amended that the remaining 7 induction injections were administered as 1% nitroethane in saline solution. Following challenge, 24th and 48th hour evaluations found 2 and 1 control guinea pigs, respectively, with mild reactions at the site of injection. None of the induced animals demonstrated sensitization. Study authors concluded that nitroethane may be characterized as a nonsensitizer under the conditions of this study.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 20.8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates nitroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase nitroethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 110 days. Nitroethane is expected to undergo direct photolysis in the atmosphere based on 76.1-83% degradation within 24 hours measured during photodegradation tests. If released to soil, nitroethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 20. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.76X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Nitroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Limited biodegradation data suggest that nitroethane may biodegrade under aerobic conditions but not under anaerobic conditions. Mineralization of nitroethane reached 23.9% in five days using an activated sludge inoculum, but less than 1% of the initial nitroethane was biodegraded in 28 days using the closed bottle test. In anaerobic soil, nitroethane was not biodegraded over a 35 day period. Direct photolysis is expected to occur on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight. If released into water, nitroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 18 hrs and 8 days, respectively. A measured BCF of 1 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to nitroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where nitroethane is produced or used. Use and monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to nitroethane via inhalation of air contaminated with tobacco smoke and dermal contact with consumer products containing nitroethane.

Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

The light-induced degradation of nitroethane in the gas phase was measured according to the Fujiki Test; this test uses three 360 nm and three 300 nm emitting lamps and Pyrex glass reaction tubes(2,3). After 24 hours, degradation of nearly 83%(2) and 76.1% was reported for nitroethane(3). When nitroethane was adsorbed onto silica gel and exposed to light from a mercury-vapor lamp for 17 hours, 9.5%(4) to 11%(2) degradation was reported(2). Nitroethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

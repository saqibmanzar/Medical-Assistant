When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.3X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-acetylaniline will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-acetylaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.6 hours. Particulate-phase 4-acetylaniline will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 4-Acetylaniline (in alcohol solution) has UV absorption maximum at 316 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 4-acetylaniline is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 25. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization of 4-acetylaniline from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. 4-Acetylaniline may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Aerobic biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, 4-acetylaniline is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Aromatic amines and ketones are generally resistant to aqueous environmental hydrolysis. Occupational exposure to 4-acetylaniline may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-acetylaniline is produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 4-acetylaniline is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.6 hours(SRC), calculated from its estimated rate constant of 1.05X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Particulate-phase 4-acetylaniline may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). 4-Acetylaniline (in alcohol solution) has UV absorption maximum at 316 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 4-acetylaniline is expected to have very high mobility in soil. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). The initial bonding reaction is followed by a slower and much less reversible reaction believed to represent the addition of the amine to quinoidal structures followed by oxidation of the product to give an amino-substituted quinone; these processes represent pathways by which aromatic amines may be converted to latent forms in the biosphere(6).",

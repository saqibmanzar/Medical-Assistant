When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The bioconcentration factor (BCF) in the epaxial muscle at 42 d for both of these compounds was less than 1; the skin had a BCF value of 1 and 9, respectively. The half-life (t1/2) elimination for the high and low dose of picric acid was 12.0 and 12.5 d, respectively; and for picramic acid was 9.0 and 9.5 d, respectively. In separate experiments, approximately 34% of the injected [14C]picric acid was metabolized to picramic acid, glucuronide conjugates, and an unidentified group of compounds, and 42% of the [(14)C]picric acid was metabolized to picric acid, glucuronide conjugates, and an unidentified group of compounds. The low bioconcentration in the trout muscle may be due to the trout's ability to excrete the parent compound and metabolites. The higher radioactivity observed on the skin may be due to the water route of exposure and the binding of the parent compounds to protein.",

By adopting the straight forward precipitation method, a new luminescent nanoscale Zn(ii) coordination polymer (TB-Zn-CP) was synthesized in quantitative yield using Zn(OAc)2*2H2O and tetraacid linker L (1:0.5) in DMF at room temperature. The phase-purity of as-synthesized TB-Zn-CP was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction analysis, infra-red spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis suggests that TB-Zn-CP is thermally stable up to 330 \u00b0C and the morphological features of TB-Zn-CP was analyzed by SEM and AFM techniques. The N2 adsorption isotherm of thermally activated TB-Zn-CP at 77 K revealed a type-II reversible adsorption isotherm and the calculated Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was found to be 72 sq m/g. Furthermore, TB-Zn-CP displayed an excellent CO2 uptake capacity of 76 mg/g at 273 K and good adsorption selectivity for CO2 over N2 and H2. The aqueous suspension of as-synthesized TB-Zn-CPshowed strong green fluorescence (lambda(max) = 520 nm) characteristics due to the internal-charge transfer (ICT) transition and was used as a fluorescent sensor for the discriminative sensing of nitroaromatic explosives. The aqueous suspension of TB-Zn-CP showed the largest quenching responses with high selectivity for phenolic-nitroaromatics (4-NP, 2,4-DNP and PA) even in the concurrent presence of other potentially competing nitroaromatic analytes. The fluorescence titration studies also provide evidence that TB-Zn-CP detects picric acid as low as the parts per billion (26.3 ppb) range. Furthermore, the observed fluorescence quenching responses of TB-Zn-CP towards picric acid were highly reversible. The highly selective fluorescence quenching responses including the reversible detection efficiency make the nanoscale coordination polymer TB-Zn-CP a potential material for the discriminative fluorescent sensing of nitroaromatic explosives.",

It is also challenging to detect in trace amounts and in situ because of its highly acidic and anionic character. Here, we assess sensing of PA under nonlaboratory conditions using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) silver nanopillar substrates and hand-held Raman spectroscopy equipment. The advancing elasto-capillarity effects are explained by molecular dynamics simulations. We obtain a SERS PA detection limit on the order of 20 ppt, corresponding attomole amounts, which together with the simple analysis methodology demonstrates that the presented approach is highly competitive for ultrasensitive analysis in the field.",

OxP-MN (1) acts as a selective and reversible probe for rapid colorimetric detection of picric acid (PA) among other nitroaromatics by switching between two porphyrinoid states. This system displayed a higher beta2 value of 1.7 x 10(8) M-2 and was able to detect PA down to 1.12 ppm (4.99 uM). beta-Dicyanovinyl substituted porphyrinogen (OxP-MN) reported here contains a porphyrinogen anion binding site and a dicyanovinyl group as a cyanide-dependent reactive subunit. OxP-MN displayed the first evidence that a beta-electron acceptor through a vinyl linker in the case of porphyrinogen results in only an abated shift in the spectrum in contrast to its porphyrin analogues. Porphyrinogen OxP-MN (1) can be switched between a number of porphyrinoid states such as metalloporphodimethene, metalloporphyrin, porphyrinogen, etc. by using CN-, F- and other basic anions. In addition, OxP-MN unveils the unique property of detecting toxic cyanide ions and fluoride ions when \"hidden\" within a mixture of other anions. Also, OxP-MN behaves as a dual sensor for picric acid and basic anions such as F-, CN-, OAc-, and H2PO4- via the indicator displacement assay under the unrestricted queue.",

The obtained N-GQDs emitted strong blue fluorescence under 365 nm UV light excitation with a high quantum yield of 59.2%. They displayed excitation-independent behavior, high resistance to photobleaching and high ionic strength. In addition to the good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity of the N-GQDs and pH in the range 2-7, the fluorescence intensity of the N-GQDs could be greatly quenched by the addition of a small amount of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP). A sensitive approach has been developed for the detection of TNP with a detection limit of 0.30 uM, and a linearity ranging from 1 to 60 uM TNP could be obtained. The approach was highly selective and suitable for TNP analysis in natural water samples.",

The PEL can be given in three ways. [1] Time-weighted average (PEL-TWA): average exposure based on an 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Short-term exposure limit (PEL-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday. [3] Ceiling limit (PEL-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Contact with concrete floors may form the friction-sensitive calcium picrate [Urbanski, 1964, vol. 1, p. 518]. Contact with metallic zinc or lead can cause detonation. Salts with ammonia, amines and complexes with hydrocarbons are less sensitive [Kirk-Othmer, 1965, vol. 8, p. 617]. Sufficiently pure samples of picric acid have the same order of stability as TNT [Chem. Eng. News, 1979, 57(41), p. 51]. Impure samples are less stable. Mixtures with aluminum and water will ignite after a delay period [Hajek, V. et al., Research, 1951, 4, p. 186].",

Can act as an oxidizing agent. If mixed with strong reducing agent, may explode on contact or begin a vigorous reaction that culminates in a detonation. Forms salts and other adducts with concrete, ammonia, and other bases and also with many metals (including copper, lead, mercury, zinc, nickel, iron). These materials may detonate when subjected to heat, friction, or impact inducing an explosion in the unreacted picric acid. Incompatible with strong oxidizing agents such as chlorates and nitrates. Can ignite and burn if dried out. Heat built up in confined spaces when large quantities burn can cause detonation. Emits highly toxic fumes of NOx and explodes when heated to decomposition.",

Burns if ignited by a flame and continues to burns quietly if the quantity is small or, if large, is thinly spread over an area. The dry compound can explode if shocked or exposed to heat. Wetting significantly reduces the tendency to explode. Readily forms salts on contact with many metals (including copper, lead, mercury, zinc, nickel, iron). The salts are sensitive explosives when subjected to heat, friction, or impact. Contact with concrete floors may form the friction-sensitive explosive calcium picrate [Urbanski, 1964, vol. 1, p. 518]. Contact with metallic zinc or lead can cause detonation. Salts with ammonia, amines and complexes with hydrocarbons are less sensitive [Kirk-Othmer, 1965, vol. 8, p. 617].",

Approx 3 wk prior to the outbreak, more than 90 metric tons of confiscated Japanese ammunition containing picric acid had been dumped in the immediate vicinity of the anchorage. The trinitrophenol was apparently carried over in the vapor phase into the freshwater supply upon distillation of the seawater. Levels of picric acid ranging from 2 to 20 mg/L were found in the drinking water.",

It is used in explosives, matches, electric batteries, in the leather industry, for etching copper, in the manufacture colored glass, and as a textile mordant. It is also a reagent for preparation of organic derivatives for chemical identification. HUMAN STUDIES: Picric acid dust or fumes cause irritation of eyes, and this may be aggravated by sensitization. Skin contact with the dry powder of picric acid or ammonium picrate powder caused sensitization dermatitis among workers. The face was usually involved, especially around the mouth and sides of the nose. Edema, papules, vesicles, and finally desquamation developed. Potential symptoms of overexposure also include yellow stained hair and skin, weakness, myalgia, anuria, polyuria, bitter taste, GI disturbances, hepatitis, hematuria, albuminuria, and nephritis. Systemic poisoning following the absorption of picric acid caused symptoms of headache, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Yellow coloration of the skin and conjunctiva have occurred, and there have been reports of darkened or port wine-colored urine. During the 1920's and 30's picric acid was used both alone and in combination with butyl aminobenzoate as an antiseptic surgical dressing for treatment of burns. A serious dysfunction of the central nervous system following topical application of picric acid was reported. Approximately 4% of the patients treated with picric acid were sensitive and developed a local dermatitis. ANIMAL STUDIES: Blood gas analysis indicated severe acidosis during acute intoxication. After an acute lethal dose of picric acid, dogs died from respiratory paralysis. Autopsy results demonstrated the presence of yellow staining of the subcutaneous fat, lung, intestines and blood vessels. Swelling of the liver and glomerulitis were also observed. Sublethal doses of picric acid less than or equal to 50 mg/kg in dogs have resulted in transitory changes in the kidney, including glomerulitis and other changes in kidney ultrastructure. Mutagenic assays of picric acid were carried out with histidine-requiring strains of Salmonella typhimurium. Picric acid (10 micrograms per plate) demonstrated mutagenicity (both frame shift and base substitution-type mutations) only after metabolic activation. Picric acid was reported to be positive for the induction of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: No significant inhibition of growth was observed for rainbow trout exposed to 0.45 and 0.05 mg/L picric acid. American oysters exposed to 0.45 and 0.05 mg/L picric acid showed significant inhibition of shell deposition during exposure period. Discoloration of nacre layer of the shell and body mass was observed in oysters.",

The 144 hr shell deposition EC50s were 27.9 mg/L for picric acid and 5.6 mg/L for picramic acid. Sediment adsorption studies in estuarine water indicated that both compounds are not readily adsorbed.

The most sensitive toxicity test endpoints overall were the macroalga zoospore germination and the polychaete reproduction tests. The most toxic ordnance compounds overall were tetryl and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene. These were also the most degradable compounds, often being reduced to very low or below-detection levels at the end of the test exposure.

Whole sediment toxicity was analyzed by the 10-day survival test with the amphipod Ampelisca abdita, and porewater toxicity tests assessed macro-algae (Ulva fasciata) zoospore germination and germling growth, sea urchin (Arbacia punctulata) embryological development, and polychaete (Dinophilus gyrociliatus) survival and reproduction. ... The ...  picric acid LC50 in the sandy sediment /was/ 144 mg/kg dry weight ... . The fine-grained sediment spiked with picric acid generated a U-shaped concentration-response curve in the amphipod test, with increased survival both in the lowest and highest concentration. Grain-size distribution and organic carbon content strongly influenced the behavior of ordnance compounds in spiked sediments. ... Porewater toxicity varied with its sedimentary origin and with ordnance compound. The sea urchin embryological development test tended to be the least sensitive. /Picric acid was the least/ toxic chemical in all porewater tests ... .",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7.5X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates picric acid will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase picric acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 110 days. Particulate-phase picric acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Picric acid contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, picric acid is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2250. The pKa of picric acid is 0.42, indicating that this compound will exist entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Picric acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 23% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, picric acid is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Mixed cultures of phenol adapted microorganisms exhibited little or no oxygen uptake in the presence of picric acid, suggesting that picric acid is resistant to degradation under aerobic conditions. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's pKa. BCFs of <2.2 measured in carp suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The picric acid concentration in sterile pore water decreased at 20 \u00b0C over 28 days, suggesting that unknown abiotic breakdown processes contribute to picric acid transformation. Under simulated solar radiation, picric acid concentration in seawater decreased over 47 days exposure. Occupational exposure to picric acid may occur through inhalation dust or its salts and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where picric acid is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of the anion from moist soil is not expected because anions do not volatilize(SRC). Picric acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 7.5X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5).

A pKa of 0.42(3) indicates picric acid will exist entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). The picric acid concentration in sterile pore water decreased from 2000 umoles/L to <1500 umoles/L at 20 \u00b0C after 28 days, suggesting that hydrolysis or other unknown abiotic breakdown processes contribute to picric acid transformation(4). According to a classification scheme(5), BCFs of <2.2 measured in carp (Cyprinus carpio)(6) suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Under simulated solar radiation, the picric acid concentration in seawater decreased from 3510.55 umoles/L to 3206.05 umoles/L after 47 days exposure(4). Mixed cultures of phenol adapted microorganisms exhibited little or no oxygen uptake in the presence of picric acid(7-8), suggesting that picric acid is resistant to degradation under aerobic conditions(SRC).",

The picric acid concentration in sterile pore water decreased from 2000 umoles/L to <1500 umoles/L at 20 \u00b0C after 28 days, suggesting that unknown abiotic breakdown processes contribute to picric acid transformation in marine sediments(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

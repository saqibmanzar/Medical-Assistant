ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The amount of deamination of amphetamine and of N-n-propylamphetamine was approximately equal, in vitro, in rats and guinea-pigs but two to three times greater in liver homogenates from rabbits. Approximately three times more deaminated products were formed from the in vitro metabolism of N-n-propylamphetamine than from amphetamine metabolism by all three species.",

The enzymatic character of the reaction was demonstrated by the increase of product with microsomal protein and dependency on NADPH and oxygen. Furthermore, phenobarbital induction markedly increased the formation of phenylacetone. Carbon monoxide decreased the reaction indicating the involvement of a metalloenzyme. Experiments with H2(18)O indicated that the carbonyl oxygen originated from water. It is suggested that the microsomal metabolism of 2-nitro-1-phenylpropane involves an enzymatic step followed by chemical hydrolysis of an intermediate, possibly a secondary nitronic acid.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.16 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates phenyl 2-propanone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase phenyl 2-propanone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.7 days. Phenyl 2-propanone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, phenyl 2-propanone is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 80. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Phenyl 2-propanone has an estimated vapor pressure of 0.16 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, phenyl 2-propanone may volatilize from dry soil. When exposed to soil microorganisms, phenyl 2-propanone was rapidly metabolized, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important enviornmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, phenyl 2-propanone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 and 80 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 4.1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to phenyl 2-propanone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where phenyl 2-propanone is produced or used. Limited monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to phenyl 2-propanone via ingestion of food, inhalation of tobacco smoke, and inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing phenyl 2-propanone.

Vapor-phase phenyl 2-propanone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.7(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.6X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Phenyl 2-propanone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

There are two significant issues relating to such dumps of materials; they might contain valuable evidence as to drug manufacture, and they might be a source of pollution. This study presents initial findings in relation to the impact microorganisms from environmental sources have upon drugs, their precursors, and manufacturing by-products. The aim of this study was to identify which chemicals associated with clandestine drug laboratories persist in the environment in order to allow forensic drug chemists to link discarded residues with the method of manufacture, and to allow the environmental impact of clandestine drug laboratories to be assessed accurately. When exposed to soil microorganisms, phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) was rapidly metabolized into mixtures of 1-phenyl-2-propanol, 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione, 1-hydroxy-1-phenyl-2-propanone, 2-hydroxy-1-phenyl-1-propanone, and the two diastereoisomers of 1-phenyl-1,2-propanediol. On the other hand, when exposed under the same conditions, methylamphetamine sulfate (MAS) remained virtually unchanged. Implications relating to evidence gathering for forensic purposes and to environmental assessment of clandestine drug laboratories are discussed.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

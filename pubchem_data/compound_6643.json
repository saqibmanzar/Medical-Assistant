When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

These materials are incompatible with strong reducing substances such as hydrides, nitrides, alkali metals, and sulfides. Flammable gas (H2) is often generated, and the heat of the reaction may ignite the gas. Heat is also generated by the acid-base reaction between phenols and bases. Such heating may initiate polymerization of the organic compound. Phenols are sulfonated very readily (for example, by concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature). The reactions generate heat. Phenols are also nitrated very rapidly, even by dilute nitric acid. Nitrated phenols often explode when heated. Many of them form metal salts that tend toward detonation by rather mild shock. This material can react with oxidizing materials.",

Based on a review of these data and on public comments on the Agency's assessments for the active ingredients 4-t-amylphenol and its salts (potassium and sodium), the Agency has sufficient information on the human health and ecological effects of to make decisions as part of the tolerance reassessment process under FFDCA and reregistration process under FIFRA, as amended by FQPA. The Agency has determined that products containing 4-t-amylphenol and its salts are eligible for reregistration provided that: (i) current data gaps and confirmatory data needs are addressed; (ii) the risk mitigation measures outlined in this document are adopted; and (iii) label amendments are made to reflect these measures. ... Based on its evaluation of 4-t-amylphenol and salts, the Agency has determined that 4-t-amylphenol and salts products, unless labeled and used as specified in this document, would present risks inconsistent with FIFRA. Accordingly, should a registrant fail to implement any of the risk mitigation measures identified in this document, the Agency may take regulatory action to address the risk concerns from the use of 4-t-amylphenol and salts. If all changes outlined in this document are incorporated into the product labels, then all current risks for 4-t-amylphenol and salts (potassium and sodium) will be substantially mitigated for the purposes of this determination.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer saftey standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Amylphenol is found on List C. Case No: 3016; Pesticide type: fungicide, antimicrobial; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the RED document.; Active ingredient (AI): amylphenol; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 12/17/92; AI Status: The producers of the pesticide have made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner."

The most common symptoms reported for cases of inhalation exposure were respiratory irritation/burning, irritation to mouth/throat/nose, coughing/choking, shortness of breath, dizziness, flu-like symptoms, and headache. Eye pain, burning of eyes, conjunctivitis, blurring vision, and acute inflammation have been reported in ocular exposure incidents. Neurological effects, such as dizziness, headache and blurred vision have also been reported.",

The cell number achieved by similar inocula of MCF-7 cells (estrogen-sensitive human breast cancer cells) in the absence of estrogens (negative control) and in the presence of 17beta-estradiol (positive control) is compared with the number of cells achieved with a range of concn of the test chemical. For 4-tert-pentylphenol, a concn of 10 uM was the lowest concn needed for maximal cell yield. For the positive control 17beta-estradiol, the lowest concentration needed was 30 pM. The relative proliferative effect (RPE) is calculated as 100 x (PE-1) of the test compound divided by (PE-1) of 17beta-estradiol. A value of 100 indicates that the compound tested is a full agonist of the estradiol; a value of 0 indicates that the compound lacks estrogenicity at the doses tested. Intermediate values suggest that the compound is a partial agonist of 17beta-estradiol. For 4-tert-pentylphenol, an RPE of 105 was estimated.",

The test substance was dissolved in a 50% v/v solution of ethanol (200 proof) in distilled water; all doses were administered at a constant volume of 6.0 mL/kg. No treatment-related deaths or clinical signs were observed. Dermal irritation was not observed in controls or at 2.5 mg/kg/day. At 10 and 25 mg/kg/day, both sexes exhibited dose-related dermal irritation, such as erythema and desquamation which progressed to eschar formation with subsequent eschar exfoliation. The incidence and severity of the dermal irritation were increased in the 25 mg/kg/day group where the eschar formation progressed to cover 50 - 75% of the application site in two males and five females. Ulcerations were also observed within the exposure site of three males and five females in the 25 mg/kg/day group. Eschar formation in the 10 mg/kg/day group progressed to cover 10 - 25 of the application site in one male and three females. No biologically significant changes in bw or bw gain were observed at any dose level. No biologically significant changes in food consumption were observed. A transient increase (p<0.05) in food consumption was noted during study days 8 - 15, but was small (+8%), and not accompanied by a corresponding change in body weight. No treatment-related ocular effects were noted in test animals. Hematological parameters showed no biologically significant changes due to the test substance. Clinical chemistry parameters were affected significantly by treatment to the test substance Organ weights were not affected by treatment to the test substance. No other gross pathological findings were made. Histopathological observations were limited to the treated skin of rats in the 10 and 25 mg/kg/day groups. These changes included minimal to marked acanthosis, minimal to mild chronic or acute dermatitis, inflammatory exudate on the epidermal surface and occasional ulcers. The incidence and severity of the dermal changes were dose dependent. The systemic NOAEL is 25 mg/kg/day. The LOAEL has not been established. The dermal NOAEL is 2.5 mg/kg/day. The LOAEL is 10 mg/kg/day based on histopathological changes, dermal irritation characterized by erythema, desquamation, eschar formation and subsequent eschar exfoliation.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.00X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.2 hours. Reaction with atmospheric nitrate radicals may be important; half-lives of 12.3 min to 3.5 min were estimated based on rate constants of phenols and alkyl phenols for reaction with NO3 radicals. 4-(1,1-Dimethylpropyl)phenol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenol is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3.7X10+3. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 4-(1,1-Dimethylpropyl)phenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data for 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenol were not available. If released into water, 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 18 and 140 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 87 months if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 210 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenol may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenol is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenol via dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 87 months if adsorption is considered (8).

Vapor-phase 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.2 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.2X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Reaction with atmospheric nitrate radicals may be important(3); rate constants of phenols and alkyl phenols for reaction with NO3 radicals range from 1.37X10-11 to 3.92X10-12 cu cm/mole sec(5) which correspond to half-lives of 12.3 min to 3.5 min at an evening concentration of 2.4X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(6). 4-(1,1-Dimethylpropyl)phenol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Nevertheless, cases of hepatitis, jaundice and hepatic failure have been reported to the sponsor and are mentioned in the product label. The liver injury may be immunoallergic and similar in pattern to that attributed to nevirapine and efavirenz. In immunoallergic hepatitis due to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, injury usually arises within 1 to 8 weeks of starting therapy. Signs of hypersensitivity are common including rash, fever, and eosinophilia and sometimes facial edema, lymphadenoapthy and lymphocytosis. The serum enzyme pattern can be cholestatic, hepatocellular or mixed. Recovery is rapid upon stopping therapy.",

Springer Nature aims to provide only highly qualitative and relevant content but references of lower relevance aren't withheld as they might contain also very useful information.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

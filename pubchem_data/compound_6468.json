PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Less common signs included ear and facial twitches, priapism, abdominal contractions, emesis, and convulsions. The time course of withdrawal was characterized by an initial recovery from the PCP-induced intoxication at about 4 hr after saline substitution. Onset of hyper-responsive behaviors became evident at 8-12 hr, with the maximum number of symptoms occurring 12-15 hr post-substitution. The syndrome dissipated over 24 hr, however, and all withdrawal signs were immediately reversed by PCP (0.25 g/kg, iv).

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

We previously reported that phencyclidine (PCP), an NMDA receptor antagonist, increased locomotor activity in wildtype (WT) mice but not GluN2D subunit knockout mice. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the GluN2D subunit is involved in PCP-induced motor impairment. PCP or UBP141 (a GluN2D antagonist) induced potent motor impairment in WT mice but not GluN2D KO mice. By contrast, CIQ, a GluN2C/2D potentiator, induced severe motor impairment in GluN2D KO mice but not WT mice, suggesting that the GluN2D subunit plays an essential role in the effects of PCP and UBP141, and an appropriate balance between GluN2C and GluN2D subunits might be needed for appropriate motor performance. The level of the GluN2D subunit in the mature mouse brain is very low and restricted. GluN2D subunits exist in brainstem structures, the globus pallidus, thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus. We found that the expression of the c-fos gene increased the most among PCP-dependent differentially expressed genes between WT and GluN2D KO mice, and the number of Fos-positive cells increased after PCP administration in the basal ganglia motor circuit in WT mice but not GluN2D KO mice. These results suggest that the GluN2D subunit within the motor circuitry is a key subunit for PCP-induced motor impairment, which requires an intricate balance between GluN2C- and GluN2D-mediated excitatory outputs.",

Phencyclidine (PCP) suppression of PPI in animals has been studied to elucidate the pathological elements of schizophrenia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PCP treatment or PPI in the brain are still poorly understood. In this study, quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis was performed on the prefrontal cortex from rats that were subjected to PPI after being systemically injected with PCP or saline. PCP downregulated phosphorylation events were significantly enriched in proteins associated with long-term potentiation (LTP). Importantly, this data set identifies functionally novel phosphorylation sites on known LTP-associated signaling molecules. In addition, mutagenesis of a significantly altered phosphorylation site on xCT (SLC7A11), the light chain of system xc-, the cystine/glutamate antiporter, suggests that PCP also regulates the activity of this protein. Finally, new insights were also derived on PPI signaling independent of PCP treatment. This is the first quantitative phosphorylation proteomic analysis providing new molecular insights into sensorimotor gating.",

Administration of PCP to rodents is used as a preclinical model for schizophrenia; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the symptoms remain largely unknown. Acute PCP treatment rapidly induces behavioral and cognitive deficits; therefore, post-translational regulation of protein activity is expected to play a role at early time points. We performed mass-spectrometry-driven quantitative analysis of rat frontal cortex 15, 30, or 240 min after the administration of PCP (10 mg/kg). We identified and quantified 23,548 peptides, including 4749 phosphopeptides, corresponding to 2604 proteins. A total of 352 proteins exhibited altered phosphorylation levels, indicating that protein phosphorylation is involved in the acute response to PCP. Computational assessment of the regulated proteins biological function revealed that PCP perturbs key processes in the frontal cortex including calcium homeostasis, organization of cytoskeleton, endo/exocytosis, and energy metabolism. This study on acute PCP treatment provides the largest proteomics and phosphoproteomics data sets to date of a preclinical model of schizophrenia. Our findings contribute to the understanding of alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia and provide a foundation for discovery of novel targets for pharmacological intervention.",

PCP also induces behavioral and cognitive abnormalities in non-human animals, and PCP-treated animals are considered a reliable pharmacological model of schizophrenia. However, the exact neural mechanisms by which PCP modulates behavior are not known. During the last decade several studies have indicated that disturbed activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may be closely related to PCP-induced psychosis. Systemic administration of PCP produces long-lasting activation of medial PFC (mPFC) neurons in rats, almost in parallel with augmentation of locomotor activity and behavioral stereotypies. Later studies have showed that such PCP-induced behavioral abnormalities are ameliorated by prior administration of drugs that normalize or inhibit excess excitability of PFC neurons. Similar activation of mPFC neurons is not induced by systemic injection of a typical psychostimulant such as methamphetamine, even though behavioral hyperactivity is induced to almost the same level. This suggests that the neural circuits mediating PCP-induced psychosis are different to those mediating methamphetamine-induced psychosis. Locally applied PCP does not induce excitation of mPFC neurons, indicating that PCP-induced tonic excitation of mPFC neurons is mediated by inputs from regions outside the mPFC. This hypothesis is strongly supported by experimental results showing that local perfusion of PCP in the ventral hippocampus, which has dense fiber projections to the mPFC, induces tonic activation of mPFC neurons with accompanying augmentation of behavioral abnormalities. In this review we summarize current knowledge on the neural mechanisms underlying PCP-induced psychosis and highlight a possible involvement of the PFC and the hippocampus in PCP-induced psychosis.",

The PCPI was evaluated by testing 523 urine specimens. Controls containing 0 ng/mL of PCP and -25% (negative control) and +25% (positive control) of the 25 ng/mL cutoff calibrator were analyzed with each batch. All urines were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS-MS) for PCP. Of the 523 specimens tested, 218 yielded positive results by the PCP assay. HPLC-MS-MS confirmed the presence of at least 25 ng/mL in 214 specimens, indicating four false-positive results containing 11, 13, 16, and 20 ng/mL PCP. Three specimens yielded a negative result; however, PCP concentrations were within 20% of the 25 ng/mL cutoff value. The overall agreement of PCPI and HPLC-MS-MS results was 98.7%. The sensitivity of the PCPI was 0.982 and the specificity 0.987. Testing at 100 ng/mL of other drugs or their metabolites demonstrated no cross-reactivity. The within-run precision was CV = 2% (n = 12); the between-run precision was CV = < 6% (n = 4). The assay was found linear from -50% to 150% (12.5-37.5 ng/mL) of the cutoff concentration. The Lin-Zhi PCPI provides a precise, reliable method for the routine detection of phencyclidine in urine specimens.",

Rapid chromatographic separation decreased the analysis time relative to standard gas chromatography (GC)-based methodologies. The method involved the use of solid-phase extraction for sample preparation and cleanup followed by liquid chromatography tandem spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis and an electrospray-ionization (ESI) interface. PCP was quantified using multiple-reaction-monitoring with deuterium labeled PCP (PCP-d5) as an internal standard. The method was validated for accuracy, precision, linearity, and recovery. The method was accurate with error <14% and precision with coefficient of variation (CV) <5.0%. The assay was linear over the entire range of calibration standards (r2 > 0.997). The recovery of PCP after solid-phase extraction was greater than 90% with the lower limit of detection (LLOD) for PCP in 500 uL of human serum after solid-phase extraction at 0.06 ng ml-1. This method was used to determine the levels of PCP in postmortem human blood samples. The LLOD in blood was 1 ng ml-1. Blood PCP concentrations were also determined separately using GC and flame ionization detection (FID). Blood calibration standards and serum calibration standards yielded similar concentrations when used to quantitate authentic human blood samples that tested positive for PCP under the GC-FID method. Extraction of PCP from serum required fewer steps and therefore could be used as a calibration matrix in place of blood. The LC-MS/MS methodology shown here was higher throughput compared with GC-based methods because of very short chromatographic run times. This was accomplished without sacrificing analytical sensitivity.",

PCP was formerly used as a preinduction anesthetic and as an animal tranquilizer. It has no current medical indications, although it is still used illegally as a hallucinogen. HUMAN STUDIES: PCP causes distortion of perception and produces a feeling of detachment of dissociation from the user's surroundings and self. It is not a classic hallucinogen but better described as a dissociative agent or anesthetic. The hallmark of PCP toxicity is the recurring delusion of superhuman strength and invulnerability resulting from both its anesthetic and dissociative properties. There are case reports of patients presenting with trauma either from jumping from high altitudes, fighting large crowds or the police, or self-mutilation. Children have become intoxicated by ingesting the butts of used PCP-impregnated cigarettes or from passive inhalation of sidestream smoke. Children aged 5 years and younger often present with lethargy, severe depression of consciousness, ataxia, nystagmus, and staring episodes. Presenting signs may also include apnea, seizures, opisthotonos, and choreoathetosis. Miosis may be present. In children, unexplained stupor or coma, seizures, ataxia, nystagmus, strange behavior, staring spells, or unusual posturing can indicate possible PCP intoxication. Patients may present with various combinations of CNS stimulation and depression, cholinergic and anticholinergic effects, and adrenergic effects. The most common physical findings are nystagmus (horizontal, vertical, or rotatory) and hypertension. Respiratory depression and aspiration may also occur. Some patients display evidence of nystagmus, ataxia, loss of muscle coordination, and vital sign abnormalities without obvious signs of behavioral toxicity. Irritability, hypertonicity, poor feeding, and abnormal neurobehavior have been reported in newborns of phencyclidine abusing mothers. ANIMAL STUDIES: Subchronic PCP treatment induces schizophrenic-like behavior in rodents, including cognitive deficits and increased locomotor sensitivity towards acute administration of PCP. Perinatal PCP administration in rat blocks the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor and causes symptoms reminiscent of schizophrenia in human. Animals exposed to PCP during the neonatal period have fewer GABAergic interneurons in the corticolimbic area, including the hippocampus, and exhibit abnormal behaviors after attaining maturation. In developmental studies 25 to 30 mg/kg of PCP was injected into rats on gestational days 6 through 15 and produced skeletal dysplasias and cleft palates in the offspring. Growth retardation and delay in reflexes was found in the offspring of mice exposed to 5 to 20 mg/kg of PCP.",

Nevertheless, phencyclidine remains an agent of abuse, used for its hallucinogenic effects. At low doses, phencyclidine appears to have little effect on the liver. However, high doses of phencyclidine have been associated with malignant hyperthermia which can trigger acute hepatitis necrosis and liver failure. Patients generally present with seizures and coma followed by severe hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis and renal failure. The liver injury arises 1 to 2 days after the overdose with marked, rapid elevations in serum ALT, AST and LDH, with minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase and delayed rises in bilirubin (Case 1). Coma arises early along with prolongation of the prothrombin time, hyperammonemia and metabolic acidosis. The abnormalities resolve almost as rapidly as they develop and with suitable life support, survival is not uncommon (Case 1). The clinical syndrome is that of acute hepatic necrosis and resembles the acute liver injury that occurs with heat shock, severe hypoxia and hepatic ischemia. Liver biopsy shows severe centrilobular necrosis with mild inflammation.",

Recent research on the contributing factors toward chronic use of nicotine-containing products has implicated the role of reinforcement-enhancing effects of nicotine. The present study investigates whether phencyclidine (PCP) may also possess a reinforcement-enhancement effect and how this may interact with the reinforcement-enhancement effect of nicotine. PCP was tested for two reasons: (1) it produces discrepant results on overall reward, similar to that seen with nicotine and (2) it may elucidate how other compounds may interact with the reinforcement-enhancement of nicotine. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to lever press for brief visual stimulus presentations under fixed-ratio (FR) schedules of reinforcement and then were tested with nicotine (0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg) and/or PCP (2.0 mg/kg) over six increasing FR values. A selective increase in active lever-pressing for the visual stimulus with drug treatment was considered evidence of a reinforcement-enhancement effect. PCP and nicotine separately increased active lever pressing for a visual stimulus in a dose-dependent manner and across the different FR schedules. The addition of PCP to nicotine did not increase lever-pressing for the visual stimulus, possibly due to a ceiling effect. The effect of PCP may be driven largely by its locomotor stimulant effects, whereas the effect of nicotine was independent of locomotor stimulation. This dissociation emphasizes that distinct pharmacological properties contribute to the reinforcement-enhancement effects of substances.",

Rat pups were treated with NaCl (0.9%) or PCP (10 mg/kg) at postnatal days 2, 6, 9 and 12. One control (NaCl-35) and one experimental (PCP-35) group have received lindane (4 mg/kg) at postnatal day 35, while others received lindane at postnatal day 65 (NaCl-65 and PCP-65). One week prior to lindane treatment three gold-plated EEG electrodes were implanted. Pubertal rats had significantly shorter latency time. After lindane, a prompt increase in power spectral density seen in PCP-treated groups vs. control was evident earlier in PCP-65 rats. The theta waves were significantly increased in PCP-35 and alpha rhythm in PCP-65 rats, when compared with corresponding controls. Postnatal PCP treatment increases the synchronization of brain electrical activity, thus contributing to the increased susceptibility to lindane.",

Mice were treated with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (50 mg/kg, po) and PCP (15 mg/kg, ip) alone or in combination for 16 days and with PCP alone for 35 days. delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol had a significant effect on spermatogenesis and decreased the number of all germinal cells except spermatids after 35 days of treatment. Combination of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and PCP treatment caused a significant decrease in resting and pachytene spermatocytes. Similarly, combination of these two drugs caused a significant increase in cauda epididymal abnormal sperms. These results suggest that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and PCP may cause greater disruption in spermatogenesis when they are abused together.",

Unilateral intracerebral injection of NMDA (25 nmol/0.5 microliters) into the corpus striatum of pups consistently produced severe confluent neuronal necrosis in the striatum extending into the dorsal hippocampus and overlying neocortex. The distribution of damage corresponded to the topography of NMDA type glutamate receptors in the vulnerable regions. With this lesion in developing brain, the weight of the injected hemisphere 5 days later can be used as a quantitative measure of brain injury. Intraperitoneal administration of MK-801 (0.02-42.0 umol/kg), TCP (3.5-54.0 umol/kg), PCP (1.0-41.0 umol/kg), and CPP (1.0-60.0 umol/kg) 15 min after NMDA injection had prominent dose-dependent neuroprotective effects. MK-801 was 14 times more potent than other compounds tested and the 50% protective dose (PD50, that dose which reduced damage by 50% relative to untreated NMDA-injected controls) was 0.63 umol/kg. Corresponding values for CPP, PCP, and TCP were 8.84, 10.85, and 24.05 umol/kg respectively. The lowest dose of MK-801 that provided significant protection was 0.2 umol/kg (0.04 mg/kg, 37.9 + or - 4.6% protection). Four umol/kg (0.8 mg/kg) of MK-801 completely protected against NMDA-mediated damage. The study provides the first direct in vivo comparison of the neuroprotective abilities of these compounds. Systemic administrations of MK-801, TCP, PCP, and CPP all limit NMDA-induced neuronal injury in this model. The susceptibility of the immature brain to the neurotoxicity of NMDA provides a sensitive, reproducible, and quantitative in vivo system for comparing the effectiveness of drugs with protective actions against excitotoxic neuronal injury.",

In mice the principal initial effect is excitation and not depression. However, in the dog and other species, depression is produced by PCP at low dosages; excitation leading to convulsive seizures may occur following large doses. IM admin of 2 mg/kg PCP in the rhesus monkey results in significant decrease in the heart rate about 3 min after the injection and lasts 2 hr. A corresponding decrease in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure occurs. These changes are only significant for the initial 90 min. Electrocardiogram irregularities, along with prominent changes in the QRS amplitude also occur. The electroencephalogram of PCP-treated monkeys is affected within 3 min following injection. Decrease in amplitude of alpha rhythm and, occasionally, gamma waves appear to be reestablished. Three hr later, upon repeated admin of PCP up to one-half the dose (ie, 1 mg/kg) by the iv route, the drug produces an immediate but temporary decline in arterial pressure, change in the electrocardiogram, and catalepsy.",

Evidence is accumulating that the gut microbiota (GM) influences behavior through modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and hence, part of the variation within this animal model may derive from variation in the GM. The aims of this study was to investigate first, the duration of subPCP-induced cognitive impairment in the novel object recognition test, and second, the possible effect of subchronic PCP-treatment on the GM, and the association between the GM and the behavioral parameters. The association was further investigated by antibiotic reduction of the GM. Male Lister Hooded rats were dosed twice daily i.p. with either 5 mg/kg PCP or sterile isotonic saline for seven days followed by a seven-day washout period. Rats were tested in the novel object recognition and the locomotor activity assays immediately after, three weeks after, or six weeks after washout, and the fecal GM was analyzed by high throughput sequencing. Antibiotic- and control-treated rats were tested in the same manner following washout. In conclusion, subPCP-treatment impaired novel object recognition up to three weeks after washout, whereas locomotor sensitivity was increased for at least six weeks after washout. Differences in the core gut microbiome immediately after washout suggested subPCP treatment to alter the GM. GM profiles correlated to memory performance. Administration of ampicillin abolished the subPCP-induced memory deficit. It thus seems reasonable to speculate that the GM influences memory performance, contributing to variation within the model.",

PCP abuse by pregnant women has been reported to result in the birth of infants exhibiting irritability, jitteriness and hyperactivity with high pitched cries. The present study was designed to evaluate the distribution of PCP in the maternal and fetal brain and the neurochemical effects produced by gestational exposure. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated sc with 5 mg/kg PCP on 3 consecutive days (GD 9-11, 12-14, 15-16, or 18-20). On gestational day 21 all rats were killed by decapitation and maternal and fetal blood was collected for PCP analysis. Brains were dissected from dams and fetuses for PCP and neurochemical analyses. On gestational day 21 after exposure on gestational day 18-20, the fetal: maternal ratio of brain PCP concentrations was 11:1. PCP exposure on gestational day 12-14, 15-17, and 18-20 significantly decreased fetal brain PCP binding sites on gestational day 21, whereas maternal values were unchanged. Fetal dopaminergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding and neurotransmitter concentrations were unaffected by prenatal PCP exposure. These data demonstrated that maternal PCP exposure resulted in prolonged exposure of the developing CNS and also indicated that gestational exposure to PCP decreased high affinity binding sites of PCP in term fetal brain.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.9X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates phencyclidine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase phencyclidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.7 days. Phencyclidine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, phencyclidine is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1300. The pKa of phencyclidine is 8.29, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. Phencyclidine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil were not available. If released into water, phencyclidine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation data in water were not available. A pKa of 8.29 indicates phencyclidine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 580 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to phencyclidine may occur via the inhalation of fumes from illicit laboratories and the handling of confiscated material, especially for law enforcement officers involved in drug raids. However, occupational exposure to phencyclidine should be low or non-existent since phencyclidine is not legally produced in the US. The general public is not likely to be exposed to phencyclidine. Use data indicates exposure to phencyclidine among the general population is likely limited to individuals involved in its illegal manufacture and individuals who engage in illicit use of products containing phencyclidine, via inhalation of powder, inhalation of smoke, and ingestion.

A pKa of 8.29(2) indicates phencyclidine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

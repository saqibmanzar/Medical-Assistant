When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Pyridoxine, pyridoxal, & pyridoxamine are converted to the active forms of the vitamin, pyridoxal phosphate & pyridoxamine phosphate, which act as coenzymes in a wide variety of reactions in intermed metab. The active forms of the vitamin are involved in transamination of amino acids & in the conversion of tryptophan to niacin. Pyridoxine appears to be essential in the synth of y aminobutyric acid (GABA) within the CNS & in the synth of heme. Pyridoxine deficiency results in the accum & urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid (an intermed metabolite of tryptophan) & in decr glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase activity in erythrocytes; measurement of either of these may be used to diagnose pyridoxine deficiency. For detn of xanthurenic acid excretion, an oral loading dose of 2 10 g of tryptophan is usually given; urine is collected for 8 hours & then analyzed for xanthurenic acid. Urinary excretion of vitamin B6 or 4 pyridoxic acid can also be analyzed to determine pyridoxine deficiency.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Intakes of 1 to 2 mg/kg pyridoxine daily are considered safe for neonates and infants receiving isoniazid for treatment or prevention of tuberculosis infection. Mothers taking a supplemental dose of 7.5 to 20 mg daily to prevent or treat B6 deficiency should have milk levels that provide an adequate B6 intake for the exclusively breastfed infant. Lower doses increase milk levels somewhat, but not necessarily sufficient. Higher doses of 100 to 200 mg daily used to prevent or treat some B6-responsive diseases have not been studied during lactation, but would not be expected to expose breastfed infants to a harmful amount. High-dose pyridoxine does not appear to be effective for lactation suppression.",

At 12 months all the infants were still partly breastfed. All mothers were given a 1 mg pyridoxine supplement to take once daily beginning on postpartum day 5 and most took a pyridoxine supplement during pregnancy. Maternal vitamin B6 status was not reported. Seven of the 44 infants developed low B6 status during the first 6 months postpartum. Between 6 and 9 months those 7 infants had lower weight-for-age, and length grew more slowly than study infants with adequate status. By 10 to 12 months of age, there were no longer differences. This and other studies by the same group. suggest that exclusive breastfeeding carries a risk of infant low vitamin B6 status and poor growth, despite low-dose maternal supplementation.",

The infant had been put to breast one time prior to the onset of tremors. Biochemical tests of the infant\u2019s blood were all within normal limits except their serum vitamin B6 was five times the upper normal limit. The mother\u2019s serum vitamin B6 was twice the upper normal limit. The mother had been taking daily prenatal vitamins containing 4 mg of pyridoxine during pregnancy. Upon discontinuation of the maternal supplement, the infant\u2019s serum B6 level decreased to near the upper normal limit within a month, symptoms gradually improved, and abnormal EEG findings at 2 months of age resolved by 6 months of age. Since the infant in this case only breastfed once and likely consumed only small amounts of colostrum, which has much lower levels of vitamin B6 than mature milk, this case likely involves vitamin B6 toxicity from transplacental exposure and not breastfeeding exposure. Considering the mother was not taking a high prenatal dose, this case also suggests some form of genetic variation in vitamin B6-dependent or metabolizing proteins in the mother and/or infant, which was not tested. Discontinuing maternal supplementation and reducing maternal dietary B6 intake, but continuing to breastfeed, is a reasonable approach in such a situation, since infant formula is likely to have a higher amount of vitamin B6.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It is apparent that more than one mechanism is responsible for the effects of this class and that the importance of these mechanisms to the activity of individual members of the class varies. In part, these differences in mechanism can be related to the differences in tumor phenotypes that are induced. One phenotype seems to be associated with prior characterizations of tumors induced by peroxisome proliferators and is induced by TCA. The second phenotype involves glycogen-poor tumors that stain heavily with antibodies to c-Jun and c-Fos. This phenotype is produced by DCA. These effects are probably produced by selection of lesions with differing defects in cell signalling pathways that control the processes of cell division and cell death.",

A cohort study /was conducted/ to evaluate semen quality in men with well-characterized exposures to DBPs. Participants were 228 presumed fertile men with different DBP profiles. They completed a telephone interview about demographics, health history, water consumption, and other exposures and provided a semen sample. Semen outcomes included sperm concentration and morphology, as well as DNA integrity and chromatin maturity. Exposures to DBPs were evaluated by incorporating data on water consumption and bathing and showering with concentrations measured in tap water. ... Multivariable linear regression /was used/ to assess the relationship between exposure to DBPs and adverse sperm outcomes.  ... The mean (median) sperm concentration and sperm count were 114.2 (90.5) million/mL and 362 (265) million, respectively. The mean (median) of the four trihalomethane species (THM4) exposure was 45.7 (65.3) ug/L, and the mean (median) of the nine haloacetic acid species (HAA9) exposure was 30.7 (44.2) ug/L.

The results of this study indicate that TBA at up to 400 ppm marginally reduced water consumption and did not affect reproductive function or produce general toxicity.

MBA was negative in the SOS chromotest at levels as high as 1000 ug/mL and in the newt micronucleus assay. However, it was active at concentrations as low as 20 ug/mL in the Ames fluctuation assay with S9 fraction added to the incubation medium. DBA was positive with and without S9 fraction in the SOS chromotest, requiring 100 ug/mL in the former case and 200 ug/mL in the latter. Thus, it is about 5 times as potent as DCA in this test. In the Ames fluctuation assay, DBA was active at 10 ug/mL without S9 and at 30 ug/mL with S9.

Data were also available to compare these results with cytotoxicity and mutagenicity studies in Salmonella typhimurium. The rank order in decreasing chronic cytotoxicity measured in a microplate-based assay was bromoacetic acid (BA) >> 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX) > dibromoacetic acid (DBA) > chloroacetic acid (CA) > KBrO(3) > tribromoacetic acid (TBA) > EMS (ethylmethanesulfonate, positive control) > dichloroacetic acid (DCA) > trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The induction of DNA strand breaks by these agents was measured by alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE, comet assay) and the rank order in decreasing genotoxicity was BA >> MX > CA > DBA > TBA > EMS > KBrO(3), while DCA and TCA were refractory. BA was more cytotoxic (31x) and genotoxic (14x) than MX in CHO cells. BA was over 400x more genotoxic than potassium bromate. The brominated haloacetic acids (HAAs) were more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogs. The HAAs expressed a statistically significant inverse relationship in CHO cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as a function of increased numbers of halogen atoms per molecule. A quantitative comparison was conducted with results from a previous study with cytotoxicity and mutagenicity in S. typhimurium. There was no correlation between chronic CHO cell and bacterial cell cytotoxicity. DBP-induced CHO cell cytotoxicity was not related to mutagenic potency in S. typhimurium. Cytotoxicity in CHO cells was statistically significant and highly correlated to CHO cell genotoxicity. Finally, ...  the DBP genotoxic potency in CHO cells and the mutagenic potency in S. typhimurium were not related. This suggests that toxicity data in S. typhimurium did not quantitatively predict the toxic effects of DBPs in mammalian cell systems.",

The cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of the drinking water disinfection by-products (DBPs) bromoform (BF), bromoacetic acid (BA), dibromoacetic acid (DBA), tribromoacetic acid (TCA), chloroform (CF), chloroacetic acid (CA), dichloroacetic acid (DCA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX), and potassium bromate (KBrO3) /were analyzed/ in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, and RSJ100 +/- S9. Solvent controls of DMSO and ethanol and a positive control of ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) were also analyzed. ...  The distributions of the rank order for the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of these DBPs were compared and the structure-function relationships were identified. TA100 -S9 was the most sensitive strain for these DBPs. The rank order of the mutagenic potency adjusted with a cytoxicity factor was MX > BA > EMS > DBA > DCA > CA with TBA, TCA, BF, and CF not mutagenic. From a structure-function perspective, the brominated acetic acids were more cytotoxic and mutagenic than their chlorinated analogs. ...",

With the SOS chromotest, only three of the chemicals studied (dichloroacetic acid, dibromo- and tribromoacetic acids) were found to induce primary DNA damage in Escherichia coli PQ 37. In the Ames fluctuation test, all the compounds except monochloroacetic acid showed mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100. In these two in vitro tests, a good correlation between increasing number of substituents and decreasing mutagenicity was observed. Namely, the toxicity of brominated and chlorinated acetic acids decreased when the number of substituents increased. The newt micronucleus test detected a weak clastogenic effect on the peripheral blood erythrocytes of Pleurodeles waltl larvae for trichloroacetic acid only.",

This study design was selected to identify the process (development; female reproduction; male reproduction; various somatic organs/processes) that is the most sensitive to tribromoacetic acid exposure. The dose range-finding study was conducted at concentrations of 0, 30, 100, 300, and 500 ppm of TBA in the drinking water for two weeks. Based on decreased water consumption in the 500 ppm males and females, the dose levels of 0, 10, 70, and 400 ppm (Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively) were selected for the main study, which utilized two groups of male rats designated as Group A (non-BrdU treated animals, 10 rats in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4) and Group B (BrdU-treated, 5 rats in Groups 1, 2, and 3, and 8 rats in Group 4), and three groups of female rats designated as Group A (peri-conception exposure, 10 rats in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4), Group B (gestational exposure), and Group C (peri-conception exposure, BrdU-treated, 5 rats in Groups 1, 2, and 3, and 8 animals in Group 4). Control animals received deionized water, the vehicle.  During the treatment period, all animals survived to the scheduled necropsy and there were no clinical signs of general toxicity noted at any dose level. There were no treatment-related findings in body weights or feed consumption, but there was a slight and inconsistent decrease in water consumption in the 400 ppm animals. The overall calculated consumption of TBA for Groups 2-4 was 1, 7, and 39 mg/kg/day, respectively. Male and female gross necropsy findings were comparable across dose groups with the exception of a 40% incidence of mottled kidneys in the 400 ppm A males. Female and male reproductive findings were unremarkable. The visceral evaluation of the newborn heart and brain using Wilson's soft tissue free hand slicing technique did not reveal any treatment-related effects. Adult male organ weights, organ-to-body weight ratios, and clinical chemistry and hematology endpoints were unaffected by TBA treatment with the following exceptions: a 14 % increase in liver-to-body weight ratio in the 400 ppm A males, and an increase of 12% and 10%, respectively, in blood urea nitrogen and serum albumin in the 400 ppm A males. The increases in BUN and albumin represent a small, but possible biologically significant indicator of dehydration, probably attributable to decreased fluid consumption. The increase in BUN accompanied by the increase in mottled kidneys may also suggest mild kidney toxicity which could result in morphological changes with a longer term exposure. No treatment-related histopathology was noted in the organs of the A males or in cellular proliferation as measured by BrdU Labeling Index from the liver, kidney, or urinary bladder from the B males or C females.  The results of this study indicate that TBA at up to 400 ppm marginally reduced water consumption and did not affect reproductive function or produce general toxicity. From these data, TBA is not a reproductive toxicant in males or females at doses up to 400 ppm. This conclusion rests heavily on the shortness of the current exposure, and should be replicated using a longer study before the data are relied on.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.8X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tribromoacetic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tribromoacetic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 30.9 days. Tribromoacetic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tribromoacetic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 5.3. The pKa of tribromoacetic acid is 0.72, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Tribromoacetic acid is unlikely to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, tribromoacetic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A pKa of 0.72 indicates tribromoacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. Limited data are available regarding the biodegradation of tribromoacetic acid in the environment. However, tribromoacetic acid (0.1% w/v) was used as a carbon source by Pseudomonas and Nocardia when measured for halide released over a period of 20 days at 30 \u00b0C. An estimated BCF of 0.63 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to bromoacetic acid via ingestion of chlorinated or chloraminated drinking water, particularly when source waters contain high concentrations of bromide.

The pKa of tribromoacetic acid is 0.72(4), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Tribromoacetic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 2.8X10-4 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(6). Limited data are available regarding the biodegradation of tribromoacetic acid in soil. However, tribromoacetic acid (0.1% w/v) was used as a carbon source by Pseudomonas and Nocardia when measured for halide released over a period of 20 days at 30 \u00b0C(7).",

A pKa of 0.72(4) indicates tribromoacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 0.63(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Limited data are available regarding the biodegradation of tribromoacetic acid in water. However, tribromoacetic acid (0.1% w/v) was used as a carbon source by Pseudomonas and Nocardia when measured for halide released over a period of 20 days at 30 \u00b0C(8).",

Vapor-phase tribromoacetic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 30.9 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.2X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Tribromoacetic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The substance yielded negative results in two new studies on genotoxicity in vivo, but limitations in these studies and positive findings in tests for genotoxicity in vitro as well as lack of knowledge on the modes of action operative at the various tumour locations led the Committee to the conclusion that a genotoxic mode of action could not be excluded. Accordingly, the cancer dose-response data were analysed by benchmark dose modelling to calculate BMD10 and BMDL10 values. The Committee concluded that a representative mean intake for the general population of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol of 0.051 \u00b5g/kg bw per day and an estimated high-level intake (young children included) of 0.136 \u00b5g/kg bw per day could be used in the evaluation. Comparison of these mean and high-levels intakes with the lowest BMDL10 of 3.3 mg/kg bw per day, which was the BMDL10 for incidence data on tumour-bearing male rats for all treatment-affected locations, indicates margins of exposure of approximately 65 000 and 24 000, respectively. Based on these margins of exposure, the Committee concluded that the estimated intakes of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol were of low concern for human health. The available evidence suggests that 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol occurs at lower concentrations than 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol in soy sauce and related products, and also in acid-HVP food ingredients. However, in meat products the concentrations of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol are generally higher than the concentrations of 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Parent animals in the test and control vessels had to be pipetted 3 times/wk in freshly prepared test and control media at the corresponding concn level. The no observed effect concn (NOEC) was determined from the parameters of mortality of the parent animals, reproduction rate and appearance of the first offspring during the test period. In preliminary acute Daphnia tests, the 24 hr EC50 was 983 mg/l for 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol, the EC0 was 558 mg/l. The nominal 21 day no observed effect concn was 16 mg/l, with the most sensitive parameter being reproduction rate.",

Destruction of sinusoidal linings appeared at 4 hr, and was gradually aggravated along the advancing hepatocytic necrosis. Monocytic influx into the necrotic areas was initiated at 6 hr. At 48 hr, collapsed centrilobular spaces showed a loss of most sinusoidal structures with active phagocytosis of macrophages, proliferation of perisinusoidal cells, and accumulation of collagen fibrils. At 72 hr, there were many regenerating sinusoidal structures.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.75 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 days. If released to soil, 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Based upon conflicting results with aerobic aqueous screening biodegradation tests, the importance of biodegradation in soil and water is unknown. If released into water, 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 1,3-Dichloro-2-propanol is expected to have a hydrolysis half-life at pH 7 and 8 of approximately 1.4 years and 34 days, respectively. Occupational exposure to 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.8X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates trimethylhexadecylammonium chloride will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase trimethylhexadecylammonium chloride will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, trimethylhexadecylammonium chloride is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2.2X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.9X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Trimethylhexadecylammonium chloride will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. If released into water, trimethylhexadecylammonium chloride is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. 10-20 ppm trimethylhexadecylammonium chloride was degraded with a half-life of 3.1 days in freshwater at 20 \u00b0C and pH 6.9. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 71 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to trimethylhexadecylammonium chloride may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where trimethylhexadecylammonium chloride is produced or used. The general population may be exposed due to the use of consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

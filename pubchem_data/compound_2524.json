PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Some analogs have been found to reduct elevated parathyroid hormone concentrations in patients with renal osteodystrophy associated with hyperparathyroidism. Theoretically, any of the vitamin D analogs may be used for the above conditions, However, because of their pharmacologic properties, some may be more useful in certain situations than others. Alfacalcidol, calcitriol, and dihydrotachysterol are usually preferred in patients with renal failure since these patients have impaired ability to synthesize calcitriol from cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol; therefore, the response is more predictable. In addition, their shorter half-lives may make toxicity easier to manage (hypercalcemia reverses more quickly). Ergocalciferol may not be the preferred agent in the treatment of familial hypophosphatemia or hypoparathyroidism because the large doses needed are associated with a risk of overdose and hypercalcemia; dihydrotachysterol and calcitriol may be preferred. /Included in US product labeling/",

The presence of bile is required for absorption of ergocalciferol and the extent of GI absorption may be decreased in patients with hepatic, biliary, or GI disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, Whipple's disease, sprue). Because vitamin D is fat soluble, it is incorporated into chylomicrons and absorbed via the lymphatic system; approximately 80% of ingested vitamin D appears to be absorbed systemically through this mechanism, principally in the small intestine. Although some evidence suggested that intestinal absorption of vitamin D may be decreased in geriatric adults, other evidence did not show clinically important age-related alterations in GI absorption of the vitamin in therapeutic doses. It currently is not known whether aging alters the GI absorption of physiologic amounts of vitamin D. /Vitamin D analogs/",

The natural or endogenous supply of vitamin D in man mainly depends on ultraviolet light for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 in the skin. Vitamin D3 must be metabolically activated in the liver and the kidney before it is fully active on its target tissues. The initial transformation is catalyzed by a vitamin D3-25-hydroxylase enzyme present in the liver, and the product of this reaction is 25-(OH)D3 (calcifediol). The latter undergoes hydroxylation in the mitochondria of kidney tissue, and this reaction is activated by the renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-a-hydroxylase to produce 1,25-(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), the active form of vitamin D3.",

Daily urinary calcium excretion was directly related to serum II concentrations, but increased more while subjects ate the normal calcium diet than when eating the low calcium diet. During I and ingestion of the low calcium diet, daily urinary calcium excretion averaged 7.32 mmole/day, exceeding the dietary calcium intake. Fasting urinary calcium/creatinine exceeded 0.34 mmol/mmol (the upper limit of normal) on either diet. When serum II concentrations are elevated, a high fasting urinary calcium/creatinine or high daily urinary calcium excretion, even on a low calcium diet, is insufficient criteria for the documentation of a renal calcium leak.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Cytosol of chicken intestinal cells contains a 3.7 S protein that binds calcitriol specifically and with high affinity. Formation of complex with this receptor facilitates transfer of calcitriol to nuclear chromatin. ... Calcitriol stimulates synthesis of RNA and at least two proteins in intestinal mucosa, alkaline phosphatase and a calcium-binding protein. ... It was proposed that the calcium-binding protein is involved in transport of calcium. ... /However/, it has been reported that calcitriol-induced stimulation of intestinal transport of phosphate precedes that of calcium, and it is possible that primary effect of the vitamin is on phosphate rather than calcium transport.",

I induces the differentiation of HL-60 into mono- and multinucleated macrophage-like cells. Phenotypic change is evident within 24 hours and reaches a plateau at 72-96 hours of incubation. The changes are metabolite-specific and include adherence to substrate, acquisition of the morphological features of mature monocytes, a 4 to 6-fold enhancement in lysozyme synthesis and secretion, increase in the fraction of alpha-naphthyl acetate monocyte-associated cell surface antigens. Treated HL-60 cells acquire the capacity to bind and degrade bone matrix, 2 of the essential functional characteristics of osteoclasts and related bone-resorbing cells. Evidently, vitamin D3 enhances bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis in vivo by promoting the differentiation of precursor cells.",

Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and low calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of calcitriol, further measures are probably unnecessary. Should, however, persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives which may be considered, depending on the patients' underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. The use of peritoneal dialysis against a calcium-free dialysate has also been reported.",

Early symptoms of hypercalcemia may include weakness, fatigue, somnolence, headache, anorexia, dry mouth, metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, constipation, diarrhea, vertigo, tinnitus, ataxia, exanthema, hypotonia (in infants), muscle pain, bone pain, and irritability. Later and sometimes more serious consequences of hypercalcemia may include rhinorrhea, pruritus, decreased libido, nephrocalcinosis, impairment of renal function (resulting in polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia, hyposthenuria, and proteinuria), osteoporosis in adults, decreased growth in children, weight loss, anemia, calcific conjunctivitis, photophobia, metastatic calcification, pancreatitis, generalized vascular calcification, and seizures. Rarely, patients may develop hypertension or overt psychosis. Urinary calcium, phosphate, and albumin; BUN; and serum cholesterol, AST (SGOT), and ALT (SGPT) concentrations may increase. Serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations may decrease. Serum electrolyte imbalances along with mild acidosis may result in cardiac arrhythmias. /Vitamin D/",

Patient was given sandocal (calcium lactate gluconate, combination, citric acid), which provided 40 mmol calcium daily. Plasma calcium concentration rose, plasma alkaline phosphatase, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, and hydroxyproline concentrations fell, and symptoms abated. After 46 weeks of calcium supplements, skeletal X-rays showed loss of subperiosteal erosions and healing of epiphyseal abnormalities, but increased osteosclerosis. A repeat bone biopsy showed osteomalacia completely healed. It was concluded that lack of response to calcitriol alone suggests that insufficient dietary calcium might cause osteomalacia, despite adequate supplies of vitamin D.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.2X10-12 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol does absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.1X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data for 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol were not available. If released into water, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 9600 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is produced or used. Exposure to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug Calcijex. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

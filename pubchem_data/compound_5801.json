When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If material or contaminated runoff enters waterways, notify downstream users of potentially contaminated waters. Notify local health and fire officials and pollution control agencies. From a secure, explosion-proof location, use water spray to cool exposed containers. If cooling streams are ineffective (venting sound increases in volume and pitch, tank discolors or shows any signs of deforming), withdraw immediately to a secure position ...

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye.

Can cause lung irritation. Poisonous if swallowed. These chemicals lower the blood's ability to carry oxygen (methemoglobinemia). This condition causes a bluish color to the skin and lips, headaches, dizziness; higher exposures can result in unconsciousness and death. Irritates eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Skin contact can cause burning sensation and rash ... May produce dermatitis, methemoglobinemia, bronchial asthma, and restlessness. Long term exposure: prolonged or repeated contact can cause blood damage, skin disorders, liver, kidney, and brain damage. Aminophenols may cause mutations, and there is limited teratogenic evidence. Skin allergy or asthma may develop; future exposures, even in low doses, can cause symptoms to occur. /Aminophenols/",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-aminophenol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-aminophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours. Particulate-phase 2-aminophenol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2-Aminophenol absorbs light at wavelengths 281 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-aminophenol is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 90. However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Measured pKa values are 4.72 and 9.71, for the amine and hydroxy functional groups, respectively; 2-aminophenol is amphoteric and behaves either as a weak acid or weak base; the basic character usually predominates. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Utilizing a respirometry screening test, 45% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 10 days indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 2-aminophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Under denitrifying conditions in sediment, 2-aminophenol was mineralized following a long lag phase at a rate of 12.9 umol/L/day and was not mineralized under methanogenic conditions in a 26-week sediment grab sample study. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-aminophenol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-aminophenol is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-aminophenol via dermal contact with consumer products, particularly hair dye products, containing 2-aminophenol. (SRC)",

However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(3,4), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). Measured pKa values are 4.72 and 9.71(5), for the amine and hydroxy functional groups, respectively(6); 2-aminophenol is amphoteric and behaves either as a weak acid or weak base; the basic character usually predominates(5). Volatilization of 2-aminophenol from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(7). 2-Aminophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 5X10-4 Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(8). Based on screening tests, 2-aminophenol is expected to biodegrade; when present at 100 mg/L, in a respirometry screening test using an activated sludge inoculum, 45% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 10 days(9). A rate constant of 0.279X10-2 per hour was measured for 2-aminophenol in a screening test using a non-adapted activated sludge inoculum(10). Under denitrifying conditions in sediment, 2-aminophenol was mineralized following a long lag phase at a rate of 12.9 umol/L/day(11). It was not mineralized under methanogenic conditions in a 26-week sediment grab sample study(11).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 0.62(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 2-Aminophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Based on screening tests, 2-aminophenol is expected to biodegrade when present at 100 mg/L, in a respirometry screening test using an activated sludge inoculum, 45% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 10 days(7). A rate constant of 0.279X10-2 per hour was measured for 2-aminophenol in a screening test using a non-adapted activated sludge inoculum(8). Under denitrifying conditions in sediment, 2-aminophenol was mineralized following a long lag phase at a rate of 12.9 umol/L/day(9). It was not mineralized under methanogenic conditions in a 26-week sediment grab sample study(9).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 2-Aminophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). The reaction of hydroxyl radicals with neutral solutions of 2-aminophenol results in the formation of the 2-aminophenoxyl radical(3). 2-Aminophenol absorbs light at wavelengths of 281 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). 2-Aminophenol is expected to undergo fairly rapid oxidation in the presence of air(4). Measured pKa values are 4.72 and 9.71(4), for the amine and hydroxy functional groups, respectively(5); 2-aminophenol is amphoteric and behaves either as a weak acid or weak base; the basic character usually predominates(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It is practically insoluble in water, soluble in ethanol, chloroform and ether.  Freely soluble in acetone and ethyl acetate and soluble in methyl alcohol.  Stability: at pH 5 the chemical half life was 28.3 years at 25 \u00b0C and 1.02 months at pH 8, the decomposition being due to hydrolysis.  Indications: Used as an hypnotic in insomnia but rarely as a sedative, glutethimide was initially believed to be almost free from side effects. However, further experience of its toxicity and because its dependence liability, glutethimide has been banned in many countries and many companies have stopped production.  HUMAN EXPOSURE: Main risks and target organs: The main target organ is the central nervous system causing coma with fluctuations in depth, and various degrees of hypotension.  Anticholinergic effects often occur.  Summary of clinical effects: At lower doses, acute intoxication may cause somnolence, ataxia, tonic muscle spasms and abnormal reflexes. In severe intoxication, hypotension, hypothermia, shock, coma, respiratory depression and acidosis may occur.  Effects on other organs are usually secondary to coma and shock.  Contraindications: Glutethimide is contraindicated in porphyria.  Due to its anti-muscarinic action, it should be given with great care to patients with closed-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or urinary tract obstruction, and certain cardiac arrhythmias.  Alcohol enhances absorption and the hypnotic effects of glutethimide.  Like barbiturates, glutethimide induces microsomal hepatic enzymes and enhances the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants and other drugs, lowering their plasma concentrations. Chronic administration of glutethimide may also enhance vitamin D metabolism. Absorption by route of exposure: Oral:  In six healthy volunteers given a dose of 500 mg, absorption was irregular and peak plasma concentrations occurred over one to six hours. However, in four of the six subjects absorption was biphasic.  Erratic absorption may be due to the poor solubility of glutethimide in water.  Distribution by route of exposure:  Oral:  following oral administration of 500 mg of glutethimide to healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations were achieved within two to six hours. Plasma protein binding of glutethimide was about 50%.  Glutethimide concentrations were found in the breast milk of 13 nursing mothers given glutethimide.  Glutethimide is highly lipophilic and rapidly concentrates in brain and adipose tissue.  Biological half-life by route of exposure: Oral:  The elimination half-life is 10 to 12 hours, but may increase in severe poisoning.  In six healthy subjects, initial half-lives after ingestion were 2.7 to 4.3 hours and subsequent half-lives ranged from 5.1 to 22 hours.  Metabolism: Glutethimide is partially metabolized by hydroxylation into 4-hydroxy-2-ethyl-2-phenylglutarimide. In the mouse, this appears to be twice as potent as the parent compound in mice and is believed to contribute to prolonged coma following overdosage. Hydroxylated metabolites are conjugated and excreted mainly in the urine but also in bile. Elimination by route of exposure: Oral:  glutethimide is inactivated by conjugation and the metabolites are excreted in urine, only 2% of the parent substance is excreted in urine, up to 2% of the dose has been reported to be found in the feces. Mode of action: Toxicodynamics Pharmacodynamics: Glutethimide directly blocks electron transfer in cellular respiration. Teratogenicity: There is no evidence of teratogenicity from therapeutic use.  Interactions: The effects of glutethimide are additive with those of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, codeine and other CNS depressants. Concomitant administration of antidepressants, antiparkinsonian drugs or other anticholinergic agents may cause additive anticholinergic effects such as urinary retention, exacerbation of glaucoma, or adynamic ileus.  Ethanol enhances the effects of glutethimide. Glutethimide induces the hepatic metabolism of some drugs, such as dicoumarol derivatives, the dose of drugs taken concomitantly may require adjustment.  Main adverse effects: Common adverse effects are as follows: nausea, headache, hangover, blurred vision, occasional skin rashes, blood disorders (megaloblastic anemia).  Osteomalacia peripheral neuropathy and cerebral impairment after prolonged use may also occur. Glutethimide is a drug of abuse and may cause dependence.  Acute poisoning: Ingestion: Ingestion is the only route by which acute poisoning may occur.  Mild intoxication with small doses results in somnolence, ataxia, tonic muscle spasms, abnormal reflexes.  In severe intoxication coma, hypotension, hypothermia, shock, respiratory depression and cerebral edema may occur.  Signs from other organs and systems are usually secondary to coma and shock.  Chronic poisoning:  Ingestion: Ingestion is the only route of glutethimide administration in humans. Prolonged use of the drug may cause peripheral neuropathy, hypocalcemia.  Acute abstinence syndrome following glutethimide withdrawal has been described.  Chronic ingestion of high doses is associated with impaired memory, inability to concentrate, ataxia, tremors, hyporeflexia, slurring of speech and convulsions. Course, prognosis, cause of death:  Any acute poisoning without loss of consciousness may be regarded as mild and the patient is not at risk.  The occurrence of coma, hypotension, hypothermia, shock, respiratory depression and complications such as pneumonia mean that glutethimide poisoning is potentially serious.  However, death is unusual provided intensive care when needed.  Cerebral edema may be fatal.  Systematic description of clinical effects Cardiovascular: Hypotension, shock and tachycardia have been observed.  Unexplained dysrhythmias may be due to the antimuscarinic effects of the drug or low plasma calcium concentrations. Respiratory: Respiratory depression with intermittent apnea and or arrest may occur in very severe cases. Pneumonia due to aspiration and pulmonary oedema have been reported.  Neurological: Central Nervous System (CNS): Various degrees of CNS depression may occur, ranging from lethargy to deep coma. Cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, tonic muscle spasms and hyperreflexia may occur. Truncal ataxia has been reported in acute glutethimide intoxication in children. Peripheral nervous system: Peripheral neuropathy and diplopia has been reported following chronic use. Autonomic nervous system: Glutethimide has  antimuscarinic/anticholinergic activity, tachycardia, dryness of mouth, mydriasis, irritability, urinary retention and constipation. Skeletal and smooth muscle: Tonic muscle spasm and paralytic ileus (adynamic ileus) may also be observed.  Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal atony due to parasympatholytic activity may occur.  Urinary: Renal: With the exception of possible pre-renal uremia due to severe hypotension, no other renal effects occur. Other: Urinary retention may occur due to the anticholinergic effect of glutethimide. Dermatological: Bullous changes resembling those seen in barbiturate poisoning and erythematous vesicles have been described.  Eye, ear, nose, throat: local effects: Mydriasis and papilloedema have been observed.  Hematological: Significant methemoglobinemia has been reported rarely.  In a further case, megaloblastic anemia, thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia occurred.  Metabolic: Acid-base disturbances: Acid base disturbances may occur secondary to coma or shock. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Hypocalcaemia has been described. Others: Hypothermia has been described. Special risks: Glutethimide readily crosses the placenta and may cause neonatal respiratory depression and neonatal withdrawal symptoms.  Eight to 12 hours after a maternal dose of glutethimide.  It was found in breast milk.  ANIMAL/PLANT STUDIES: Parenteral:  following intraperitoneal administration of glutethimide in rats, most of drug was found in the brain and spinal cord and other fat-containing tissues after 20 minutes.",

Each subject received an individualized fixed daily dose of warfarin and served as his own pre- and postsedative treatment control. Prothrombin times were measured four times weekly during five long-term experiments. Anticoagulant inhibition was observed during the administration of phenobarbital, secobarbital and glutethimide; there was no significant change in prothrombin test results during the trials of chloral hydrate and methaqualone. Barbiturates and glutethimide should not be administered to patients receiving coumarin drugs. The concurrent use of drugs from these groups is decreasing according to a survey of 200 hospital medical records. Chloral hydrate and methaqualone interact pharmacologically with orally administered anticoagulant agents, but the effect is not clinically significant. It is concluded that chloral hydrate and methaqualone may be administered safely without additional caution in prothrombin test monitoring during oral anticoagulant therapy.",

Although aqueous hemodialysis is less effective for glutethimide than for readily water-soluble compounds, glutethimide blood concentrations may be decreased more rapidly with hemodialysis and the duration of coma may be shortened; however, the efficacy of this procedure is controversial. Peritoneal dialysis removes some glutethimide; however, it is minimally effective. Charcoal hemoperfusion has been reported to be more effective than hemodialysis. Also, resin hemoperfusion has been reported to be more effective than hemodialysis, especially in patients with life-threatening coma and lethal blood concentrations of intoxicant drugs. Drug extraction techniques should be continued for at least 2 hours after the patient regains consciousness since glutethimide is highly lipid soluble and, therefore, rapidly accumulates in lipoid tissue. As glutethimide is removed from the bloodstream by any technique, it is gradually released from fat storage back into the bloodstream. After substantial amounts of glutethimide have been extracted, this blood-concentration rebound may cause coma to persist or recur.",

Their mean age was 34 years (range, 15 to 84 years) and 62% were female. Assisted ventilation was required in 59% of cases, and 32% developed hypotension. Six patients died, including all three aged 60 years or older. Multiple regression analysis confirmed that age was the major identifiable determinant of survival, regardless of other factors. Among identifiable determinants of coma grade, glutethimide dose, glutethimide plasma concentration, and coingestion of barbiturates were the most important. An ingested dose of 10 g or more, or a plasma concentration exceeding 30 ug/mL, was almost always associated with deep coma. However, a relatively small ingested dose or a low plasma level by no means ruled out development of serious intoxication, particularly in those patients who also ingested barbiturates. Thus elderly individuals are at high risk for fatal outcome following glutethimide overdosage and should receive priority for intensive care and monitoring. Glutethimide dose, plasma concentration, and history of coingestion of barbiturates are of value in predicting development of deep coma. These items of information should be obtained on admission whenever possible.",

The degree of CNS depression often fluctuates, possibly due to irregular absorption of the drug and/or accumulation of an active metabolite. Inadequate ventilation, even without significant respiratory depression, is often a problem and may be accompanied by cyanosis and/or sudden apnea. Dryness of the mouth, widely dilated and fixed pupils, adynamic ileus, and urinary bladder atony may also occur. Other symptoms of glutethimide intoxication include depressed or absent deep tendon and corneal reflexes and diminished or absent pain and pupilary response. Intermittent spasticity of extremities and flaccid paralysis may occur. Various complications including pulmonary edema, cerebral edema, severe infections, pyelonephritis, and acute renal tubular necrosis may occur. Death may result from hypotension, respiratory failure, cerebral edema, or complications of prolonged coma. Ingestion of 5 g of glutethimide usually produces severe intoxication in adults, and the ingestion of 10-20 g of the drug is frequently lethal. Although glutethimide blood concentrations greater than 10 ug/mL are generally associated with intoxication, there is a poor correlation between glutethimide plasma concentration and the clinical course of the patient, possibly because of the formation and accumulation of an active metabolite, 4-hyroxy-2-ethyl-2-phenylglutarimide (4-HG).",

For the in vivo study, glutethimide and aminoglutethimide were given orally (50 mg/kg, daily). After 3 wk of this regimen in mice, there was a significant fall (about 50%) in both white blood cell and platelet counts.

No hematological effects were observed in rats receiving this drug and glutethimide was without effect in either species.",

The parent compound, glutethimide, is known not to possess this toxic action. The effect of both drugs on bone (femur) marrow cells of mice and rats was examined by means of standard methods for the colony forming assay for granulocyte-macrophage (GM-CFC) and erythroid cells (CFU-E). There were no significant effects on the cell colonies up to drug concentrations of at least 10 ug/mL. However, above this level concentration-dependent effects were observed. For mouse GM-CFC, 50 and 30% of the cell colonies died when incubated with glutethimide (33 ug/mL) and aminoglutethimide (100 ug/mL), respectively. Similar results for the two drugs were obtained with the mouse CFU-E and with both cell types from the rat. The results indicate that the inhibitory effects were most likely to be non-specific. ...  It is proposed that N-hydroxylation of aminoglutethimide, which proceeds in mouse and man but not rat, is an important step in the toxic mechanism.",

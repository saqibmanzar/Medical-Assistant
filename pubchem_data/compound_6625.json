The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Attempts were made to identify the urine and fecal DDS metabolites. Iv administered DDS was rapidly distributed to the tissues, the largest amount accumulating in the adipose tissues, where it accumulated for 24 hr, and then was eliminated with an estimated halflife of 12 days. ...On repeat oral dosing at 10 mg/kg, levels of DDS in tissues seemed to reach steady state after approximately 2 weeks, at which time the concentrations in adipose reached 265 ug/g tissue. ...The second largest tissue accumulation of radiolabel occurred in the skin.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.1X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4,4'-dichlorophenyl sulfone will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4,4'-dichlorophenyl sulfone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 27 days. Particulate-phase 4,4'-dichlorophenyl sulfone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 4,4'-Dichlorodiphenyl sulfone does not absorb at wavelengths >290 and therefore, is not expected to by susceptible to direct photolysis. If released to soil, 4,4'-dichlorophenyl sulfone is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 7,600. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. 4,4'-Dichlorophenyl sulfone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 4,4'-dichlorophenyl sulfone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 200 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 4,4'-dichlorophenyl sulfone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4,4'-dichlorophenyl sulfone is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

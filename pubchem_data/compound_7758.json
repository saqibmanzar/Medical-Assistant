Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The benefits or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

                                "Description": "In general, the occupational exposure limit (OEL) indicates the level of admissible exposure, for a length of time (usually 8 hours), to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health of a worker. The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The study group consisted of three men and one woman, 41 to 65 years old, who lacked a sense of smell (anosmics) and three men and one woman 41 to 68 years old, with normal olfaction (normosmics). The subjects were exposed to 2-propanone (67641), 2-pentanone (107879), 2-heptanone (110430), 2-nonanone (821556), 2-propanol (67630), 2-methyl-2-propanol (75650), 2-butanol (78922), 4-heptanol (589559), tert-butyl-acetate (540885), and sec-butyl-acetate (105464) vapors at concentrations of 1x10-2 to 1x10+6 ppm by sniffing bottles containing the solvents. They also sniffed bottles containing a blank (nonodoriferous solvent). The subjects were asked to estimate the concentration of each solvent at which they could first detect the odor and perceive nasal pungency. Attempts were made to correlate the thresholds with the concentration of the saturated vapor at ambient temperature (23 \u00b0C). Both the normosmics and anosmics could detect the solvent vapors; however, the normosmics detected the vapors at much lower concentrations. The nasal pungency and odor thresholds of the ketones decreased with increasing carbon chain length, but tended to plateau at 2-heptanone. The odor and pungency thresholds of the alcohols tended to increase when the hydroxy group was changed from a primary to a secondary carbon atom. The odor and pungency thresholds of the esters were similar. When plotted against the logarithm of the saturation vapor concentration, the logarithm of the pungency thresholds of the compounds conformed to a linear function that was approximately parallel to the saturation vapor concentration. No association between odor threshold and saturation vapor concentration was seen. The authors conclude that anosmics as well as normosmics can detect odors of volatile organic compounds, although at different concentrations. The pungency threshold data suggest that physical rather than chemical factors are involved in the interaction of volatile organic compounds with the nasal mucosa.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 17 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates sec-butyl acetate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase sec-butyl acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 70 hours. sec-Butyl acetate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, sec-butyl acetate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 16. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. sec-Butyl acetate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 86% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, sec-butyl acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.4 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 6 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to occur slowly based upon estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 3.5 years and 128 days at pH 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to sec-butyl acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where sec-butyl acetate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to sec-butyl acetate via ingestion of food containing this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 17 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 6200 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.4 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 6(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.72(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A value of 86% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(9) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Hydrolysis is expected to occur slowly based upon estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 3.5 years and 128 days at pH 7 and 8, respectively(10).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

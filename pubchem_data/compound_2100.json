PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The amatoxins cause a delayed gastroenteritis at least 4-8 hours after ingestion, often followed by liver and kidney failure 24-48 hours after ingestion of the poisonous mushrooms. The diarrhea is typically watery or cholera-like and may be profuse enough to cause dehydration and shock. Of 10,584 mushroom exposures reported by the American Association of Poison Control Centers in 1996, only 54 were due to the potentially fatal amatoxins. The most common illness following mushroom ingestion is a self-limited gastroenteritis after a short latency of less than 2 hours. Some mushrooms contain neurological toxins such as the hallucinogenic psilocybin or the cholinergic muscarine. Mushroom neurotoxins also have a short latency, usually 15-30 minutes.

The meal consisted of 80 to 100 mL of breastmilk and the same amount of ready-to-use infant formula (Milasan-Neu). At this time the mother already had symptoms of intoxication (vomiting and diarrhea). Because of the deterioration in her condition she was unable to continue breastfeeding the child, so the child received only formula thereafter. After the mother was admitted to the hospital for Amanita phalloides poisoning and had ASAT and ALAT values of 10,000 and 40,000, respectively (normal values about 500-550). The infant was placed under inpatient observation at children\u2019s hospital. The infant\u2019s relatives noticed nothing unusual about the child and the clinical admission examination revealed no visible evidence of a hepatic, cerebral or hematological disease. Six days after maternal mushroom ingestion, the infant\u2019s laboratory values (electrolytes, serum electrophoresis, bilirubin, gamma-GT, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, blood sugar, urine status, PTT, and PT [Quick test]) were normal except for ASAT and ALAT, which were about double the normal value.

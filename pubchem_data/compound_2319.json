Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Benefin is found on List B. Case No: 2030; Pesticide type: Herbicide; Case Status: Pre-RED - OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the RED document. Active ingredient (AI): N-Butyl-N-ethyl-a,a,a-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-p-toluidine; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 04/01/91, 03/03/95, 10/13/95; AI Status: Supported - The producers of the pesticide have made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

Ingestions of these herbicides are likely to be followed by vomiting and diarrhea due to their irritant properties.

Activated charcoal is probably effective in limiting irritant effects and reducing absorption of most or all of these herbicides. Aluminum hydroxide antacids may be useful in neutralizing the irritant actions of more acidic agents. Sorbitol should be given to induce catharsis if bowel sounds are present and if spontaneous diarrhea has not already commenced. Dehydration and electrolyte disturbances may be severe enough to require oral or intravenous fluids. ... If large amounts of herbicide have been ingested and the patient is seen within an hour of the ingestion, gastrointestinal decontamination should be considered ...

The likelihood of acute or subacute risk to non-endangered and endangered species of birds is low. Benfluralin caused reproductive effects in chronic avian studies. Avian reproductive toxicity was assessed in two studies that are presented in Table 11 below. The bobwhite quail endpoint cannot be assumed conservative, as effects were observed at the lowest dose tested of 96 ppm. Another quail study is needed to establish a No Observed Adverse Effect Concentration (NOAEC) for reproductive effects since a NOAEC was not established in this test. At the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Concentration (LOAEC) the reproductive toxicity study with the Northern Bobwhite Quail, showed developmental effects that included a decrease in the number of surviving hatchlings, decreased egg set, and decrease in 14-day hatchling survivor weight. At the LOAEC, of the reproductive toxicity study with the Mallard Duck showed an increase in the percentage of eggs that cracked. Chronic risks to birds are expected from both spray and granular formulations of benfluralin ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.6X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benfluralin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase benfluralin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours. Direct photolysis in the atmosphere may also occur since benfluralin absorbs light greater than 290 nm and photodegrades on soil and in water. Particulate-phase benfluralin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, benfluralin is expected to have no mobility based upon Koc values of 9,840-11,660. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.9X10-4 atm-cu m/mole; however adsorption may attenuate this process.  Benfluralin is metabolized with a half-life of 20 to 86 days under aerobic soil conditions and 12 days in laboratory studies under anaerobic conditions. Benfluralin may also be susceptible to photolysis on soil surfaces based on a half-life of 12.5 days in which benfluralin was applied to the surface of a soil and irradiated with sunlight. A biodegradation half-live range of 20 to 86 days in soil suggests that biodegradation is a slow environmental fate process. If released into water, benfluralin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant; however, adsorption may attenuate this process. Volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 9 days, respectively, when adsorption is ignored. The volatilization half-life from a model pond was estimated as 136 days when adsorption was considered. The aqueous photolysis half-life of benfluralin was 5.5-9.9 hours and the half-life in an anaerobic aquatic metabolism study was 38 hours. Benfluralin does not hydrolyze at environmental pH (pH 5-9) and room temperature. A BCF of 1,580 measured in fish suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Occupational exposure to benfluralin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is produced or used. Exposure to the general public may possibly occur through ingestion of drinking water derived from contaminated groundwater. (SRC)",

Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected(SRC) based on the vapor pressure of this compound(3). Benfluralin is metabolized with a half-life of 20 to 86 days under aerobic soil conditions and 12 days in laboratory studies under anaerobic conditions(2). Benfluralin may also be susceptible to photolysis on soil surfaces based on a half-life of 12.5 days in which benfluralin was applied to the surface of a soil and irradiated with natural sunlight(2). A biodegradation half-live range of 20 to 86 days in soil(4)  suggests that biodegradation is a slow process in terrestrial environments(SRC).",

Biodegradation of benfluralin in soil occurs via oxidative and reductive pathways(1). Oxidation classically occurs in aerobic soils and reduction in anaerobic soils. However, in flooded field soils, both oxidation and reduction products have been observed(1). In field soil, oxidative biodegradation of benfluralin leads to dealkylation products followed by reduction of nitro group to amino products(1,4). Rates of biodegradation of benfluralin is dependent on soil temperature and moisture content and the rate is faster at 30 \u00b0C compared to 4 \u00b0C, and in dry soil compared to water-saturated field soils(2-3). The biodegradation is faster in soils containing higher organic carbon contents(3,5). The biodegradation half-lives of benfluralin in a loam and a sandy loam soil were 0.7 month and 1.5 months, respectively, at 30 \u00b0C(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that benfluralin is expected to volatilize from water and moist soil surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 9 days(SRC). Volatilization may be attenuated due to adsorption(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond was estimated as 136 days when adsorption was considered(3). Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected(SRC) based on the vapor pressure(1). Benfluralin applied at a rate of 1.68 kg/ha to the surface of a Lakeland sand (89% sand, 5% silt, 6% clay, pH 5.9) volatilized 3, 12 and 25% within 3 hours at temperatures of 30, 40, and 50 \u00b0C, respectively at a soil moisture of 7%(4). At a soil moisture of 15.3%, volatilization losses in 3 hours were 3, 6, and 11% at temperatures of 30, 40, and 50 \u00b0C, respectively(4).",

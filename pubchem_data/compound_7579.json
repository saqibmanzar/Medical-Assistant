PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Keep patient quiet and maintain normal body temperature. Obtain medical attention. /Ethers and related compounds/",

The population of thyrotrophs (thyrotropin-producing cells) was increased in the pituitary glands of the rats with neoplasms of the thyroid gland.

In male and female rats, hepatocellular carcinomas or neoplastic nodules occurred at incidences that were dose related, and the incidences in all dosed groups (except low dose females) were higher than those in the controls. The occurence of follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas of the thyroid was dose related. Among groups of male and female rats, the incidences in the mid and high dose groups of either sex were significantly higher than those in the corresponding controls. In male and female mice, adenomas in the harderian glands occurred in all dosed groups at incidences that were significantly higher than the incidence in the matched controls. In low dose male mice and high dose female mice, hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas occured at incidences significantly higher than those in the matched controls. In female mice follicular cell adenomas in the thyroid occurred with a positive linear trend, and in a direct comparison the incidence in the high dose group was also significantly higher than that in controls. ... Under the conditions of this bioassay, 4,4'-oxydianiline was carcinogenic for male and female F344 rats, including hepatocellular carcinomas or neoplastic nodules and follicular cell adenomas or carcinomas of the thyroid. 4,4-Oxydianiline was also carcinogenic for male and female B6C3F1 mice, inducing adenomas in the harderian glands, hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas in both sexes, and follicular cell adenomas in the thyroid of females.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.5X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bis(4-aminophenyl) ether will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase bis(4-aminophenyl) ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.8 hours. Particulate-phase bis(4-aminophenyl) ether will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. bis(4-Aminophenyl) ether does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, bis(4-aminophenyl) ether is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 450. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, bis(4-aminophenyl) ether is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to bis(4-aminophenyl) ether may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bis(4-aminophenyl) ether is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

However, aromatic amines have been observed to undergo rapid and reversible covalent bonding with humic materials in aqueous solution; the initial bonding reaction is followed by a slower and much less reversible reaction believed to represent the addition of the amine to quinoidal structures followed by oxidation of the product to give an amino-substituted quinone; these processes represent pathways by which aromatic amines may be converted to latent forms in the biosphere(3).",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

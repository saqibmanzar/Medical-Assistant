PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Diets containing 2% TES lowered wt gains to 91-95% of gains made by rats fed non-TES diets. Urine silica concn of rats fed TES were generally in the range of 50-60 mg/dL. In expt 1, rats fed TES with no additional dietary calcium carbonate had a silica urolith incidence of 35%. With additions of 1 and 2% calcium carbonate to the basal-TES diet, respective urolith incidences were 45 and 60% (r = 0.99, P < 0.02). In expt 2, monobasic sodium phosphate (MP) providing 0.2% additional phosphorus resulted in a mean urine pH of 6.42 and no uroliths. Dibasic sodium phosphate (DP) without and with 0.5% sodium bicarbonate (SB) resulted in respective urine pH values of 6.78 and 7.14 and urolith incidences of 15 and 20% (MP less than DP and DP + SB, P < 0.05). However, the uroliths were small averaging less than 1 mg. In expt 3, substitution of autoclaved egg albumin for casein, the protein source in expt 1 and 2, resulted in urine pH of 7.45 and a silica urolith incidence of 46%. An equal-molar mixture of MP and DP providing an added 0.2% phosphorus resulted in a urine pH of 7.07 and reduced the urolith incidence to 4%, and 0.75% of dietary ammonium chloride either with or without the added 0.2% phosphorus gave urine acidification and complete protection from uroliths ...",

Addition of 0.2 eq/kg diet of chloride, sulfate or phosphate as sodium salts (phosphate was an equal molar mixture of mono- and dibasic sodium phosphates) resulted in a reduction in silica urinary calculi (P <0.05) by dietary chloride (15% incidence) and phosphate (5% incidence) but not by sulfate (35% incidence).",

Five rats of each sex at each dose were sacrificed after 1, 2, and 4 days. In TES-treated groups, silicate accumulated in the stomach glands and the muscle layer of the forestomach and glandular stomach. Serum chemistries demonstrated acute onset of renal failure. In the kidneys, acute tubular necrosis, accumulation of silicates, and superficial necrotizing papillitis were observed. In the renal pelvis and bladder, there was urothelial simple hyperplasia, focal erosion of the mucosa, edema, and inflammation. These acute toxic changes were dose and time dependent, but significant sex differences were not observed. The microscopic changes in the urothelium were similar to those observed following administration of high doses of sodium saccharin to male rats in which urinary silicate precipitate and crystals form.",

TMOS, as well as TEOS, caused acute tubular necrosis. Blood biochem exam revealed elevation of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine in mice treated with TEOS, TPOS and TBOS, though TMOS treated mice died and therefore could not be examined. The severity of nephrotoxicity differs among these silicon tetraalkoxides. The spleens of mice treated with TMOS exhibited cytolysis in the white and red pulp, suggesting direct injury to the spleen. The kidney seems to be a common target organ of silicon tetraalkoxides.",

Injury to tubular epithelial cells was observed in mice killed 12 and 24 hr after administration, and its severity increased with increasing dosage. The mean values of blood urea nitrogen exhibited dose-related increase in mice sacrificed 24 hr after the administration. The concentrations of Si-B increased in order of the administered doses of TEOS, and then decreased steadily. The results of Si-B were consistent with the concept that renal toxicity of TEOS is mediated by siliceous compounds. The kidney was recovering from injury 3 days after administration, and had developed tubulointerstitial nephritis, which could be regarded as repaired lesion of acute injury, by 2 wk after administration.",

The numbers of mice that died during 2 wk of observation were 0, 1, 1 and 6 in the 1, 2, 4, and 8 hr inhalation experiments. In the acute inhalation study, bw decreased after TEOS exposure and did not reach the level of control mice during 2 wk of observation except in the 1-hr inhalation study. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and acute splenic atrophy (ASA) were observed in all dead mice in the acute inhalation study, and tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) was frequently found in the surviving mice ...  However, blood biochemical examinations revealed no evidence of renal dysfunction. The olfactory epithelium was necrotic in all dead mice ... The LCL0 /Lethal concentration lo/ for 1 hr exposure to TEOS and LC50 for 4 hr exposure are greater than 1000 ppm, and ... the kidney and nasal mucosa are the target organs for TEOS inhalation.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.88 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tetraethyl silicate will exist solely in the vapor phase in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tetraethyl silicate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours. Tetraethyl silicate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tetraethyl silicate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Tetraethyl silicate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, tetraethyl silicate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.9 and 25 days respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Tetraethyl silicate is expected to undergo hydrolysis in aqueous environmental conditions, or on contact with water; without special precautions, tetraethoxysilane hydrolyzes to a gel in about 10 days. Occupational exposure to tetraethyl silicate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is produced or used. It is unlikely that the general population would be exposed to tetraethyl silicate as it is primarily used in weatherproofing mortar and cements or in a manufacturing or research setting, and it hydrolyzes upon contact with water.

Volatilization from water surfaces may occur(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.9 and 25 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 0.04(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2009). Without special precautions, tetraethoxysilane hydrolyzes to a gel in about 10 days(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

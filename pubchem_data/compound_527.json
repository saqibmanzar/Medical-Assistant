When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In atherosclerosis inhibition of cell-cell communication by atherogenic compounds, e.g., low density lipoproteins (LDL), also seems to be important. For testing atherogenic compounds we used an atherosclerosis relevant cell type, namely human smooth muscle cells. In order to investigate which part of the LDL particle would be involved in inhibition of metabolic co-operation between human smooth muscle cells in culture ... several fatty acids and their breakdown products /were tested/, namely aldehydes. Unsaturated C-18 fatty acids markedly influenced gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), whereas saturated (C18:0, C16:0) and unsaturated fatty acids with > 20 carbon atoms did not inhibit GJIC. In the case of oleic and elaidic acid, orientation seemed important; however, after exposure to palmitoleic and palmitelaidic acid no differences were found. The most potent inhibitor of GJIC was linoleic acid, which inhibited GJIC by 75%. No correlation was found between degrees of unsaturation and ability to inhibit GJIC. Of the tested aldehydes, hexanal, propanal, butanal and 4-hydroxynonenal did significantly inhibit GJIC, while pentanal had no effect. Since modification of LDL was shown to be important in order for LDL to inhibit GJIC, these results show that fatty acids and their oxidative breakdown products may be of importance for the inhibition of GJIC by LDL.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Acetaldehyde (A), acrolein (AR), formaldehyde (F) and propionaldehyde (P) are constituents of cigarette smoke and (A) is also an intermediate oxidative metabolite of ethanol. These aldehydes are known to produce sympathomimetic effects by the release of NE from adrenergic neurons and to exert cardioinhibitory effects. The type of predominant effect is dose-dependent. This study was undertaken to determine if these aldehydes result in sympathomimetic effects in the presence of G (15 mg/kg iv) in anesthetized rats. G enhanced the pressor responses to A and P in dose ranges of 5-20 and 5-10 mg/kg respectively. However, AR and F at dose ranges of 0.05-5 and 0.1-10 mg/kg, respectively, elicited only depressor responses after G. Thus, A and P exerted greater sympathomimetic effects through the release of intraneuronal NE in the presence of G. The adrenergic neuronal blocking action of G changes the blood pressure effects of AR and F. When these two compounds are administered in the absence of G, they cause predominant pressor effects, whereas in the presence of G a depressor response is noted. This depressor response is possibly by vagal stimulation and/or direct vasodilation.",

An aqueous suspension of 75% (v/v) of each alcohol and aldehyde was prepared and 25 uL was used to saturate ashless grade filter paper squares which were then placed on the forearm of each subject. Patches were covered with Parafilm and left in place for 5 minutes when the patches were removed and the area gently blotted. Sites showing erythema during the next 60 minutes were considered positive. All three subjects displayed positive responses to ethyl, propyl, butyl, and pentyl alcohols. Intense positive reactions, with variable amounts of edema, were observed for all the aldehydes tested (valeraldehyde as well as acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and butyraldehyde).",

Propionaldehyde was identified as a natural volatile emission of arboreous plants. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 317 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propionaldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase propionaldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18-20 hours. The direct photolysis rate constant for propionaldehyde in air is about 4X10-5/sec, which corresponds to a half-life of about 4.8 hrs. If released to soil, propionaldehyde is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 50. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.34X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Propionaldehyde may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Propionaldehyde reached 94% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. Propionaldehyde degrades by anaerobic biological treatment with 26% utilization being reported in a system with a 20 day hydraulic retention time. If released into water, propionaldehyde is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 11 hrs and 5.8 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to propionaldehyde may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propionaldehyde is produced or used. Monitoring data and use information indicate that the general population may be exposed to propionaldehyde via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing propionaldehyde.

Volatilization of propionaldehyde from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 7.34X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). Propionaldehyde is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 317 mm Hg(5). Propionaldehyde reached 94% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC). Propionaldehyde degrades by anaerobic biological treatment with 26% utilization being reported in a system with a 20 day hydraulic retention time(7).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.34X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 11 hrs and 5.8 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Propionaldehyde reached 94% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test(7), suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase propionaldehyde is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 or 20 hrs(SRC), calculated from rate constants of 2.11X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec(3) and 1.96X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec(4), respectively. The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of propionaldehyde with nitrate radical has been experimentally determined to be 6.0X10-13 cu cm/sec(3). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.3 hrs(SRC). The direct photolysis rate constant for propionaldehyde in air is about 4X10-5 sec-1(5), which corresponds to a half-life of about 4.8 hrs(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

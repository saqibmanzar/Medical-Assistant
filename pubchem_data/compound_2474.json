Bupivacaine blocks the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. Bupivacaine binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. The analgesic effects of Bupivicaine are thought to potentially be due to its binding to the prostaglandin E2 receptors, subtype EP1 (PGE2EP1), which inhibits the production of prostaglandins, thereby reducing fever, inflammation, and hyperalgesia.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It is also commonly injected into surgical wound sites to reduce pain for up to 20 hours after surgery. In comparison to other local anesthetics it has a long duration of action. It is also the most toxic to the heart when administered in large doses. This problem has led to the use of other long-acting local anaesthetics:ropivacaine and levobupivacaine. Levobupivacaine is a derivative, specifically an enantiomer, of bupivacaine. Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. At blood concentrations achieved with therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias and to cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. Following systemic absorption, local anesthetics can produce central nervous system stimulation, depression or both.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The fetuses were delivered either at the end of infusion or at 2 or 4 hr after dosing. Maternal and fetal blood and tissue samples were obtained for the assays of bupivacaine and its metabolites using capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The elimination half-life of bupivacaine was 37.7 min. The major metabolite was 3'-hydroxybupivacaine. Bupivacaine and 3'-hydroxybupivacaine were present in all samples at the end of administration. The fetal to maternal concentration ratio of bupivacaine in plasma was 0.29, and in the placenta was 0.63. The amnion contained the highest bupivacaine concentration: threefold higher in the maternal and 11-fold higher than in the fetal plasma. At 4 hr after dosing, bupivacaine was no longer detectable in any maternal and fetal samples, whereas 3'-hydroxybupivacaine was still present in all tissues except the fetal plasma and heart. These data indicate that a considerable amount of bupivacaine is taken up by both sides of the placenta, as well as the amnion and myometrium. 3'-Hydroxybupivacaine was present in all tissues except the fetal plasma and heart samples, even after the parent compound became no longer detectable.",

Maternal and fetal blood and tissue samples were obtained for the assays of bupivacaine and its metabolites using capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The elimination half-life of bupivacaine was 37.7 min. The major metabolite was 3'-hydroxybupivacaine. Bupivacaine and 3'-hydroxybupivacaine were present in all samples at the end of administration. The fetal to maternal concentration ratio of bupivacaine in plasma was 0.29, and in the placenta was 0.63. The amnion contained the highest bupivacaine concentration: threefold higher in the maternal and 11-fold higher than in the fetal plasma. At 4 hr after dosing, bupivacaine was no longer detectable in any maternal and fetal samples, whereas 3'-hydroxybupivacaine was still present in all tissues except the fetal plasma and heart. These data indicate that a considerable amount of bupivacaine is taken up by both sides of the placenta, as well as the amnion and myometrium. 3'-Hydroxybupivacaine was present in all tissues except the fetal plasma and heart samples, even after the parent compound became no longer detectable.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

These impulses, also known as action potentials, critically depend on membrane depolarization produced by the influx of sodium ions into the neuron through voltage-gated sodium channels. Bupivacaine crosses the neuronal membrane and exerts its anesthetic action through blockade of these channels at the intracellular portion of their pore-forming transmembrane segments. The block is use-dependent, where repetitive or prolonged depolarization increases sodium channel blockade. Without sodium ions passing through the channel\u2019s pore, bupivacaine stabilizes the membrane at rest and therefore prevents neurotransmission.   In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone.   While it is well-established that the main action of bupivacaine is through sodium channel block, additional analgesic effects of bupivacaine are thought to potentially be due to its binding to the prostaglandin E2 receptors, subtype EP1 (PGE2EP1), which inhibits the production of prostaglandins, thereby reducing fever, inflammation, and hyperalgesia.",

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

However, this assessment is controversial and complex because of the many different combinations of drugs, dosages and patient populations studied as well as the variety of techniques used and deficient design of many of the studies. In contrast, epidural bupivacaine begun after clamping of the umbilical cord appears to enhance breastfeeding success because of improved pain control. Overall, it appears that with good breastfeeding support epidural bupivacaine with or without fentanyl or one of its derivatives has little or no adverse effect on breastfeeding success. Labor pain medication may delay the onset of lactation.",

A bupivacaine bolus of 12.5 mg was followed by a continuous infusion of 17.5 mg/hour for 3 days postpartum. Patients who received bupivacaine had better pain relief as indicated by lower pain scores and a lower consumption of supplemental diclofenac for pain. Bupivacaine-treated patients also produced more milk per day than the untreated women, a difference that was statistically significant from day 3 to the end of the study on day 11 postpartum. The authors concluded that improved pain relief improved breastfeeding performance.",

The intravenous fentanyl group received a spinal injection of 15 to 20 mg of bupivacaine. A slight difference was seen in breastfeeding behavior between the groups, with the infants in the intravenous fentanyl group performing slightly worse than those in the epidural group. However, all mothers were able to breastfeed their infants at 24 hours. None had severe breastfeeding problems; 10 women in the epidural group reported mild or moderate problems and 7 women in the intravenous group reported breastfeeding problems. Twenty mothers in the epidural group and 14 in the intravenous group used supplemental bottle feeding, with the difference not statistically significant.",

Spinal anesthesia consisted of hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg and fentanyl 0.01 mg; epidural anesthesia consisted of isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% (0.5 mg per 10 cm height) and fentanyl 0.05 mg. General anesthesia consisted of propofol 2.3 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg for induction and intubation, followed by an anesthetic gas mixture and oxygen. Reportedly, nitric oxide (possibly nitrous oxide) was 50% of the gas before delivery and 67% after delivery. Sevoflurane was also used in some cases. After delivery and cord clamping, mothers received fentanyl 3 mcg/kg and rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg intravenously for placental delivery. After surgery, neuromuscular block reversal was performed with neostigmine and atropine. All patients received 1 mg/kg of diclofenac every 8 h for 24 hours after delivery and 98% of general anesthesia patients also received 100 mg of tramadol and 78.5% received acetaminophen 1 gram. No regional anesthesia patients received tramadol or acetaminophen. Patients receiving one of the regional anesthetic protocols established lactation sooner (56% and 29% after 18 and 24 hours, respectively), while 86% of women receiving general anesthesia did not establish lactation until 36 to 48 hours after surgery.",

Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered.  The first step in the management of systemic toxic reactions, as well as underventilation or apnea due to unintentional subarachnoid injection of drug solution, consists of immediate attention to the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and effective assisted or controlled ventilation with oxygen with a delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure by mask. This may prevent convulsions if they have not already occurred.  If necessary, use drugs to control the convulsions. A bolus IV injection of succinylcholine will paralyze the patient without depressing the central nervous or cardiovascular systems and facilitate ventilation. A bolus IV dose of diazepam or of thiopental will permit ventilation and counteract central nervous system stimulation, but these drugs also depress central nervous system, respiratory, and cardiac function, add to postictal depression and may result in apnea. Intravenous barbiturates, anticonvulsant agents, or muscle relaxants should only be administered by those familiar with their use. Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory measures, the adequacy of the circulation should be evaluated. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require administration of intravenous fluids, and when appropriate, a vasopressor dictated by the clinical situation (such as ephedrine or epinephrine to enhance myocardial contractile force).  Endotracheal intubation, employing drugs and techniques familiar to the clinician, may be indicated after initial administration of oxygen by mask if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a patent airway, or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is indicated.  Recent clinical data from patients experiencing local anesthetic-induced convulsions demonstrated rapid development of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis with bupivacaine within a minute of the onset of convulsions. These observations suggest that oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are greatly increased during local anesthetic convulsions and emphasize the importance of immediate and effective ventilation with oxygen which may avoid cardiac arrest.  If not treated immediately, convulsions with simultaneous hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis plus myocardial depression from the direct effects of the local anesthetic may result in cardiac arrhythmias, bradycardia, asystole, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiac arrest. Respiratory abnormalities, including apnea, may occur. Underventilation or apnea due to unintentional subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic solution may produce these same signs and also lead to cardiac arrest if ventilatory support is not instituted. If cardiac arrest should occur, successful outcome may require prolonged resuscitative efforts.  The supine position is dangerous in pregnant women at term because of aortocaval compression by the gravid uterus. Therefore during treatment of systemic toxicity, maternal hypotension or fetal bradycardia following regional block, the parturient should be maintained in the left lateral decubitus position if possible, or manual displacement of the uterus off the great vessels be accomplished.",

At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. Recent clinical reports and animal research suggest that these cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine. Therefore, incremental dosing is necessary.",

The authors compared the effects of bupivacaine on an isolated heart preparation in newborn and adult rabbits. ... A constant-flow, nonrecirculating Langendorff preparation paced atrially /was used/. Adult and newborn rabbit hearts were exposed to step-increasing concentrations of bupivacaine. For each concentration, heart rate was modified with pacing from 180 to 360 beats/min by increments of 30 beats/min. QRS complex duration (index of ventricular conduction) and the first derivative of left ventricular pressure (index of contractility) were measured. The two groups were compared using an Emax model. In newborn and adult rabbits, QRS complex duration increased with increasing bupivacaine concentration. No difference was observed between neonatal and adult hearts. Contractility decreased with increasing bupivacaine concentration. Newborn rabbits were approximately three times more sensitive than adult rabbits to the effects of bupivacaine. However, the concentration leading to 50% decrease in the first derivative of left ventricular pressure was much higher than the concentration leading to half maximum increase in QRS complex duration. In conclusion, using a whole organ preparation, the authors demonstrated that bupivacaine induces similar impairment in ventricular conduction in newborn and adult rabbits. In particular, the tonic and the phasic blocks were of similar intensity in both groups. Conversely, the effect of bupivacaine on contractility was markedly higher in newborn rabbits than in adult rabbits. Also, contractility was less impaired than ventricular conduction in both groups.",

There have been concerns that the use of such devices may be associated with chondrotoxicity and even cases of chondrolysis in the shoulder. An experimental model is presented that investigates potential chondrotoxic effects of a continuous intra-articular infusion of bupivacaine in the rabbit shoulder. We divided 30 rabbits into 3 groups that received continuous infusions of either saline solution, bupivacaine, or bupivacaine with epinephrine into the glenohumeral joint over a period of 48 hours. Animals were killed after 1 week, and osteochondral and synovial samples from the glenohumeral joint underwent analyses with confocal microscopy for live/dead cell assay, metabolic sulfate uptake assessment, and conventional histologic analysis. Infusion of bupivacaine with epinephrine and without epinephrine decreased sulfate uptake by 56% (P = .009) and 50% (P = .02), respectively, when compared with saline solution; cell viability decreased by 20% (P = .08) and 32% (P = .02), respectively. Histologic analysis yielded significantly worse scores for bupivacaine infusion with epinephrine (P = .004) and without epinephrine (P = .02). The results for bupivacaine with or without epinephrine were not significantly different. Continuous intra-articular infusion of bupivacaine with and without epinephrine led to significant histopathologic and metabolic changes in articular cartilage. Bupivacaine showed profound chondrotoxic effects in an experimental model that closely followed the current clinical application of postoperative pain pumps. The results caution against the use of such devices in applications for smaller joints with minimal clearance or dilution as a result of hematoma, where continuous exposure of cartilage to bupivacaine is expected.",

Young (3-week-old) and adult (12-week-old) rats were randomly assigned to received seven injections (1 mL/kg) of 0.25% bupivacaine (n = 6 per experiment) or isotonic saline (n = 6 per experiment) at 8 hr intervals. Rats were killed 8 hr after the last injection. Psoas muscle adjacent to the femoral nerve was quickly dissected. Oxygen consumption rates were measured in saponin-skinned fibers, mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthesis rates were determined by bioluminescence, and citrate synthase activity was determined by spectrophotometry. Muscle ultrastructural damage was also examined and scored as normal, focal disruption, moderate disruption, or extreme disruption of the sarcomeres. Bupivacaine caused a reduction of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthesis rate, a decrease of citrate synthase activity, and muscle ultrastructural damages. Young rats treated with bupivacaine showed more severe alterations of mitochondrial bioenergetics and muscle ultrastructure.",

This study was conducted to test the hypotheses that (1) 0.5% bupivacaine is toxic to articular chondrocytes, and (2) the intact articular surface protects chondrocytes from the effects of short-term exposure to 0.5% bupivacaine. Freshly isolated bovine articular chondrocytes were prepared into alginate bead cultures and were treated with 0.5% bupivacaine solution or 0.9% saline for 15, 30 or 60 minutes, washed, and returned to growth media. Chondrocytes were recovered from alginate 1 hour, 1 day, and 1 week after bupivacaine exposure; they were fluorescently labeled to identify apoptotic and dead cells and were analyzed by flow cytometry. Twelve osteochondral cores were harvested from bovine knees. The superficial 1 mm of cartilage was removed from 6 cores (top-off). Intact and top-off cores were submerged in 0.9% saline or 0.5% bupivacaine solution for 30 minutes and then maintained in chondrocyte growth media for 24 hours. Live-cell/dead-cell fluorescent imaging was assessed using confocal microscopy. Greater than 99% chondrocyte death/apoptosis was observed in all bupivacaine-exposed alginate bead cultures compared with 20% cell death in saline-treated controls (P < .05). Osteochondral cores with intact surfaces treated with 0.5% bupivacaine showed 42% dead chondrocytes. When the articular surface was removed, 0.5% bupivacaine resulted in increased cell death, with 75% dead chondrocytes (P < .05).  Results show that 0.5% bupivacaine solution is cytotoxic to bovine articular chondrocytes and articular cartilage in vitro after only 15 to 30 minutes' exposure. The intact bovine articular surface has some chondroprotective effects.  Because healthy chondrocytes are important for maintenance of the cartilage matrix, chondrocyte loss may contribute to cartilage degeneration. This study shows a cytotoxic effect of 0.5% bupivacaine solution on bovine articular chondrocytes in vitro. Although these results cannot be directly extrapolated to the clinical setting, the data suggest that caution should be exercised in the intra-articular use of 0.5% bupivacaine.",

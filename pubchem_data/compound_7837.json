ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

[3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.

Based on preliminary bacterial toxicity determinations, GMA, diluted with DMSO, was tested for mutagenicity at concentrations ranging from 100-2000 ug/plate in the absence of activation and concentrations ranging from 32-1000 ug/plate in the presence of activation using the plate incorporation method. GMA caused a positive response at all concentrations tested in tester strains TA100 and TA1535 without activation, and in tester strain TA1535 with activation. Positive responses were also observed in tester strain TA100 at 100-1000 ug/plate in the presence of activation, but not at 32 ug/plate.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.62 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates glycidyl methacrylate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase glycidyl methacrylate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 hours. Because the structurally similar ethyl methacrylate does not absorb light in the environmental UV spectrum (>290 nm), glycidyl methacrylate is not expected to directly photolyze. If released to soil, glycidyl methacrylate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be slow based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Glycidyl methacrylate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, glycidyl methacrylate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Glycidyl methacrylate reached 93-94% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be slow based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 140 and 1000 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 7X10-3 L/mole-sec was estimated using a structure estimation method; this corresponds to half-lives of 31 yrs and 3 yrs at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. The rate constant estimated for the epoxide does not include neutral hydrolysis rate constant. For some epoxides, the neutral rate constant is the dominant hydrolysis rate at environmental pHs. If the neutral rate constant is important, the estimated hydrolysis rate will under-estimate the actual rate. Occupational exposure to glycidyl methacrylate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where glycidyl methacrylate is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to glycidyl methacrylate via inhalation and dermal contact with acrylic resins and dental resins containing glycidyl methacrylate. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur slowly(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.1X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 140 days and 1000 days, respectively(SRC), using an estimation method(3). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(3), from an estimated log Kow of 0.81(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 7X10-3 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(7); this corresponds to half-lives of 31 yrs and 3 yrs at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(7). The rate constant estimated for the epoxide does not include neutral hydrolysis rate constant. For some epoxides, the neutral rate constant is the dominant hydrolysis rate at environmental pHs. If the neutral rate constant is important, the estimated hydrolysis rate will under-estimate the actual rate(SRC). Screening tests indicate that glycidyl methacrylate is readily biodegradable; it reached 93-94% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

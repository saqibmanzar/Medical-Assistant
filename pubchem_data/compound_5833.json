It promotes sodium and water excretion and potassium retention. Spironolactone was originally developed purely for this ability before other pharmacodynamic properties of the drug were discovered. It is indicated to treat several conditions, including heart failure, edema, hyperaldosteronism, and hypertension. Off-label uses of spironolactone include hirsutism, female pattern hair loss, and adult acne vulgaris.   Spironolactone was developed in 1957, marketed in 1959, and approved by the FDA on January 21, 1960.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

As spironolactone has antiandrogenic activity, its off-label uses include the treatment of hirsutism, female pattern hair loss, and adult acne vulgaris.",

In a doubleblind study, we enrolled 1663 patients who had severe heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily, and 841 to receive placebo. The primary end point was death from all causes. The trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46 percent) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35 percent; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35 percent lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10 percent of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.",

It is a potassium-sparing diuretic, and hyperkalemia is the most common and potentially serious complication of therapy. Impaired kidney function appears to increase this risk, as does supplementation with potassium chloride. Excessive diuresis can also lead to dehydration and hyponatraemia. A number of endocrine effects have also been reported, the most common of which is gynaecomastia, with a dose-related incidence of 7-52%. This side-effect is reversible and disappears upon discontinuation of therapy. Other endocrine effects include loss of sexual potency in men and menstrual irregularity, amenorrhea, breast engorgement and chloasma in women. These effects are probably due to interaction of spironolactone with the androgen receptor.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Gastrointestinal absorption was estimated to be 82% in rats, 62% in dogs and 103% in monkeys. Spironolactone was extensively metabolized in all three species, and the metabolites were excreted primarily in the urine and feces. The amount of radiolabel excreted in urine or feces of all three species was similar after intravenous and after oral dosing. In monkeys, as in humans, the amounts excreted in urine and feces were about equal, while fecal excretion predominated in rats and dogs as a result of biliary excretion. After the oral dose, the percentage of urinary excretion was 4.7% in rats, 18% in dogs and 46% in monkeys. The high excretion of radiolabel in the feces of rats (90%) after intravenous administration shows the importance of biliary excretion for that species. Species differences were also noted in the biotransformation of spironolactone. ...",

A group of metabolites are formed when sulfur of spironolactone is removed, such as [canrenone]. Sulfur is retained in another group of metabolites, including 7-alpha (\u03b1)-thiomethylspironolactone (TMS) and 6-beta (\u00df)-hydroxy-7-alpha (\u03b1)-thiomethylspirolactone (HTMS).   Spironolactone is firstly deacetylated to 7-\u03b1-thiospironolactone. 7-\u03b1-thiospironolactone is S-methylated to TMS, which is the primary metabolite, or dethioacetylated to canrenone. TMS and HTMS can be further metabolized.  In humans, the potencies of TMS and 7-\u03b1-thiospirolactone in reversing the effects of the synthetic mineralocorticoid, fludrocortisone, on urinary electrolyte composition were approximately a third relative to spironolactone. However, since the serum concentrations of these steroids were not determined, their incomplete absorption and/or first-pass metabolism could not be ruled out as a reason for their reduced _in vivo_ activities.",

It undergoes enterohepatic recirculation, but no unchanged drug appears in urine or feces. The metabolites of spironolactone can be divided into two main groups: those in which the sulfur moiety is retained and those in which the sulfur is removed by dethioacetylation. For many years, it was thought that the dethioacetylated metabolite, canrenone, was the major metabolite; however, with more specific analytical methods such as HPLC, 7alpha-thiomethylspirolactone was recognized as the major metabolite of spironolactone. This metabolite is formed by hydrolysis of the thioacetate group to form 7alpha-thiospirolactone (as an intermediate), followed by S-methylation to 7alpha-thiomethylspirolactone. This can then be hydroxylated to form 6\u00e2-hydroxy-7alpha-thiomethylspirolactone and oxidized to form 7alpha-methylsulfinyl- and 7alpha-methylsulfonylspirolactone or via sulfoxidation to form 6alpha-hydroxy-7alpha-methylsulfinyl- and 6beta-hydroxy-7alpha-methylsulfonylspirolactone. For formation of the group of metabolites in which sulfur is removed, 7alpha-thiomethylspirolactone is also dethioacetylated to canrenone, which is further metabolized by three pathways: hydrolysis of the gamma-lactone ring to form canrenoate, which is excreted in the urine as a glucuronic ester, and, next, hydroxylation to form 15alpha-hydroxy-canrenone or reduction to produce several di-, tetra- and hexa-hydro derivatives. Canrenone and canrenoate are in equilibrium with one another. Not only spironolactone but several of its metabolites have biological activity; in decreasing order of potency, these are 7alpha-thiospirolactone, 7alpha-thiomethylspirolactone and canrenone.",

Notable species differences in the metabolites of spironolactone in the feces were found, the pattern of metabolites in dog feces being markedly different from that in rats, monkeys or humans.

By binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor at the distal tubules and collecting duct, it causes sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, increases vascular stiffness and remodelling, and activates pro-inflammatory pathways.  Spironolactone and its active metabolites are aldosterone antagonists that produce a potassium-sparing diuretic effect. They competitively bind to receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule.",

The mechanism of antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone is complex and appears to involve several effects of the drug. Spironolactone decreases testosterone biosynthesis by inhibiting steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase (17alpha-hydroxylase) activity, possibly secondary to destruction of microsomal cytochrome P-450 in tissues with high steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase activity (e.g., testes, adrenals). The drug also appears to competitively inhibit binding of dihydrotestosterone to its cytoplasmic receptor protein, thus decreasing androgenic actions at target tissues. Spironolactone-induced increases in serum estradiol concentration also may contribute to its antiandrogenic activity, although such increases may not occur consistently; such increases appear to result from increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol. Spironolactone may have variable effects on serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations, possibly decreasing its production by inhibiting steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase activity or decreasing its conversion (with resultant accumulation) to androstenedione by inhibiting cytochrome P450-dependent 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone aldolase (17,20-desmolase) activity. Serum progesterone concentrations may increase with the drug secondary to decreased hydroxylation (via steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase) to 17-hydroxyprogesterone. In children, compensatory increases in lutropin (luteinizing hormone, LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion can occur, probably secondary to the drug's antiandrogenic effects (i.e., a feedback response to decreasing serum testosterone concentrations and/or peripheral androgenic activity).",

Aldosterone is elevated in animals with congestive heart failure in which the renin-angiotensin system is activated in response to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and reductions in blood pressure or cardiac output. Aldosterone is responsible for increasing sodium and chloride reabsorption and potassium and calcium excretion from renal tubules. Spironolactone competes with aldosterone at its receptor site, causing a mild diuresis and potassium retention.",

Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents which act more proximally in the renal tubule. Aldosterone interacts with a cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor to enhance the expression of the Na+, K+-ATPase and the Na+ channel involved in a Na+ K+ transport in the distal tubule . Spironolactone bind to this mineralcorticoid receptor, blocking the actions of aldosterone on gene expression. Aldosterone is a hormone; its primary function is to retain sodium and excrete potassium in the kidneys.",

Recovery has occurred within 1 to 3 months of stopping and all cases have been mild and self-limited in course (Case 1).",

Of these rats, 20 also received spironolactone (pharmaceutical-grade) at a dose of 100 mg/kg bw in 1 mL of distilled water by oral gavage twice daily for 7 days, starting 4 days before DMBA administration. The study was terminated 150 days after DMBA treatment, and the mammary tumour incidence determined by palpation. The incidence of palpable mammary tumours was reduced from 21/24 in the group receiving DMBA alone to 3/14 in that given DMBA plus spironolactone. In a second experiment, 80 female Sprague-Dawley rats received an intravenous injection into the jugular vein of 2 mg of DMBA in 0.4 mL of oil emulsion once daily on days 1, 4 and 7. Two days before the first DMBA injection, 40 of these rats received spironolactone (pharmaceutical-grade) at a dose of 100 mg/kg bw in 1 mL of distilled water by oral gavage twice daily for 12 consecutive days. On termination of the study 147 days after the start of DMBA treatment, mammary tumours were found at necropsy in 32/32 rats receiving DMBA alone and 23/36 rats receiving DMBA plus spironolactone (p < 0.001).",

In some cases this seems to happen because spironolactone causes diarrhea. Four cases involving men with New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure are presented. As these cases revealed, close monitoring of blood chemistry is mandatory after starting spironolactone, and patients should be advised to stop spironolactone immediately if diarrhea develops.",

Ten rats per group were killed after 2, 4 and 13 weeks of treatment for assessment of TSH, T4 and T3 concentrations, thyroid gland weights, histological appearance, thyroid iodine uptake and organification, and UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity. After 13 weeks of treatment, the weights of the thyroid gland were significantly increased at all doses and the concentration of TSH was increased at the two higher doses. T3 and T4 concentrations were significantly decreased at the high dose at 2 and 4 weeks but had returned to normal by week 13. Thyroid iodine uptake and binding or organification were significantly increased at the high dose. Histologically, the follicular size patterns were altered in treated rats. The follicles were generally small to medium-sized, and the few remaining large follicles were lined with taller, wider follicular epithelial cells. In addition, the liver weights and para-nitrophenol UGT activity were significantly increased. ...",

Groups of 72 males and 72 females served as untreated controls. In a second experiment reported by the same authors, groups of 30 male and 30 female rats received diets providing a dose of 0 (control), 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg bw per day of spironolactone for 104 weeks. Both studies were terminated at the end of treatment. In the 78-week study, an excess of thyroid adenomas in both males and females and of interstitial-cell adenomas in the testis was observed at the two higher doses. The incidences of thyroid tumors in controls and at the three doses were 0/59, 4/33, 15/31 and 18/28 for males and 1/62, 1/31, 12/34 and 13/34 for females, respectively.

At 70-80 days of age, some of the animals were killed while in the basal state or after injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone plus thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and blood and tissue samples were taken for analysis. The offspring showed no changes in the external genitalia, body weight or testis weight after spironolactone treatment in utero, but males showed a dose-related decrease in ventral prostate and seminal vesicle weight. The basal and stimulated plasma concentrations of follicule-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone were normal, but those of prolactin were decreased. In females, the estrus cycle was unaffected, but the weights of the ovaries and uterus were significantly increased in those given 20 mg spironolactone, and the plasma concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, estradiol and progesterone were comparable to those of controls; however, the concentrations of luteinizing hormone were increased.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.2X10-11 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates spironolactone will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase spironolactone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Spironolactone does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, spironolactone is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 770. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, spironolactone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 27 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to spironolactone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where spironolactone is produced or used. Exposure to spironolactone among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug, a diuretic. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

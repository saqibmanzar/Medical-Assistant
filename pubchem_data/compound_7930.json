ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.803 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-thiocresol will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-thiocresol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 hrs. Although thiocresols may be susceptible to photolysis, sufficient experimental data are not available to predict the relative importance of their photolysis in the environment. If released to soil, 3-thiocresol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 430. The pKa of 3-thiocresol is 6.66 indicating that the anionic form of 3-thiocresol will exist in slightly acidic to basic soils and these anions are expected to have higher mobility than the neutral species. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.6X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, volatilization of the anionic species from moist soil surfaces does not occur. 3-Thiocresol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 3-thiocresol is expected to slightly adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. However, based on the pKa, the anionic form of 3-thiocresol will exist in slightly acidic to basic waters and the anionic form will not volatilize from water. Estimated volatilization half-lives of the neutral species for a model river and model lake are 3 hrs and 5.2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 62 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 3-thiocresol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-thiocresol is produced or used. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hrs and 5.2 days, respectively(SRC). A pKa of 6.66(5) indicates that the anionic form of 3-thiocresol will exist in slightly acidic to basic waters and the anionic form will not volatilize from water(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

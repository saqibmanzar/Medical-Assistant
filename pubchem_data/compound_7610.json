When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A bioassay of technical-grade m-cresidine for possible carcinogenicity was conducted using Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. m-Cresidine in corn oil was administered by gavage five days a weeks at either of two dosages, to groups of 50 male and 49 or 50 female animals of each species. The dosages used in the chronic bioassay for low and high dose rats were 0.08 and 0.16 gm/kg/day, respectively. The time-weighted average dosages used for low and high dose mice were 0.06 and 0.11 gm/kg/day, respectively. After a 77-week dosing period observation of rats continued for an additional 32 to 33 weeks. After a 53-week dosing period, observation of mice continued for an additional observation period of up to 41 weeks. For each species, 50 animals of each sex were placed on test as untreated controls and 25 animals of each sex were placed on test as vehicle controls. The urinary bladder and the kidney were the target organs of m-cresidine toxicity in male and female rats. Papillary transitional-cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder occurred in 0/45 low dose males, 5/44 (11 percent) high dose males, 1/46 (2 percent) low dose females, and 2/44 (5 percent) high dose females but did not occur in any untreated control or vehicle control rats. Although the incidences in each dosed rat group were not statistically significant when compared to vehicle controls, comparison with historical controls indicates that these bladder carcinomas are rare and are, therefore, considered to be compound-related in both sexes. Among mice, dose-related nonneoplastic lesions were observed at higher incidences for males than females in the kidneys, spleen and thymus. Dose-related toxic effects were also observed in testes of male mice. No neoplasms occurred in male mice at statistically significant incidences. Under the conditions of this bioassay, m-cresidine was carcinogenic to Fischer 344 rats, causing papillary transitional-cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder in both sexes. No convincing evidence was provided for carcinogenicity in female B6C3F1 mice. Poor survival of male B6C3F1 mice receiving m-cresidine precluded evaluation of the possible carcinogenicity of the compound in these animals.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.025 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates m-cresidine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase m-cresidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.3 hrs. If released to soil, m-cresidine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 110. However, anilines (aromatic amines) are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, m-cresidine is expected to adsorb slightly to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Based on data for p-cresidine, a structural analog; m-cresidine is not expected to readily biodegrade in the environment. For example, p-cresidine, present at 100 mg/l, reached 0.7% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks, using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l, and the Japanese MITI test. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 and 169 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to m-cresidine may have occurred through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where m-cresidine was produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

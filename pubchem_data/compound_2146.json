These references have been ranked automatically by an algorithm which calculates the relevance for each substance in a Springer Nature document. It is based on: (1) the TF-IDF, adapted to chemical structures, (2) location information in the text (e.g. title, abstract, keywords), and (3) the document size.  Springer Nature aims to provide only highly qualitative and relevant content but references of lower relevance aren't withheld as they might contain also very useful information.",

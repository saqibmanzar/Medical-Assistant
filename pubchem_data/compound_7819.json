When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If materials or contaminated runoff enters waterways, notify downstream users of potentially contaminated waters. Notify local health and fire officials and pollution control agencies.

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

                                                    "String": "Isobutyl acrylate's production use as a comonomer in acrylic surface coatings, an intermediate for the production of polymers and as the monomer in synthetic resin manufacture may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7.07 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isobutyl acrylate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase isobutyl acrylate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.2 days. Ethyl acrylate, a compound structurally similar to isobutyl acrylate, does not absorb light in the environmental spectrum above 290 nm; therefore, direct photolysis of isobutyl acrylate is not expected to occur. If released to soil, isobutyl acrylate is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 66. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.0X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Isobutyl acrylate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. By analogy to butyl acrylate, which reached 61% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test, biodegradation of isobutyl acrylate may by an important environmental fate process. If released into water, isobutyl acrylate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.6 hours and 120 hours, respectively. An estimated BCF of 10 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. No hydrolysis data were available for isobutyl acrylate. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 1.33X10-2 L/mole-sec was estimated using a structure estimation method; this corresponds to half-lives of 1.6 years and 16.5 years at pH values of 8 and 7, respectively. Occupational exposure to isobutyl acrylate may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isobutyl acrylate is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.0X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 7.07 mm Hg(4), and water solubility(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.6 hours and 117 hours, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 10(SRC), from a log Kow of 2.22(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). No hydrolysis data were available for isobutyl acrylate. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 1.33X10-2 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(8); this corresponds to half-lives of 1.6 years and 16.5 years at pH values of 8 and 7, respectively(8). By analogy to butyl acrylate, which reached 61% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test(9), biodegradation of isobutyl acrylate may by an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In addition, this agent exerts a negative inotropic effect on the heart through a transiently induced hypocalcemic state, thereby antagonizing the inotropic and chronotropic effects of digitalis glycosides on the ventricles of the heart. Upon ocular administration, edetate exerts its ophthalmic effect by chelating calcium to form soluble complexes, thereby removing corneal calcium deposits.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Note that this is a very empirical definition and is subject to change.",

Children and adults have mistakenly received edetate disodium instead of edetate calcium disodium; at least 5 deaths have occurred as a result of inadvertent administration of edetate disodium. Although both edetate calcium disodium and edetate disodium are heavy metal antagonists, the 2 drugs were originally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for different uses and have different effects; edetate disodium was formerly FDA approved for use in selected patients for the emergency treatment of hypercalcemia or for the control of ventricular arrhythmias associated with cardiac glycoside toxicity. Use of edetate disodium may result in a substantial, and sometimes fatal, decrease in serum calcium concentrations. In June 2008, FDA withdrew its prior approval for edetate disodium because of safety concerns following a review of the risk-benefit profile of the drug. FDA stated that it was not considering additional action regarding edetate calcium disodium at that time; most of the fatalities following administration of an EDTA drug have involved medication errors in which edetate disodium was administered instead of edetate calcium disodium. FDA has not received reports of any fatalities resulting from the administration of edetate calcium disodium that involve a medication error.",

The specific activity of the (14)C Disodium EDTA was 21.6 mCi/mM and it was dissolved in saline to yield a final solution of 50 pCi/mL. Animals that received ip injections got 0.5 mL of this solution, or 25 pCi of (14)C Disodium EDTA. Animals that had the compound applied to the skin received 25 pCi of (14)C Disodium EDTA in the form of an ointment (modulan, mineral oil, petrolatum, cetyl alcohol 35:21 :25:12) spread over an area of 50 sq cm spread over a sheet of thin polyethylene. This sheet was taped to the trunk of each animal. A collar was fixed around the neck of the rats. All animals were decapitated 24 hours after treatment. The tissue distribution (per 100 mg wet organ weight) of (14)C Disodium EDTA 24 hours after ip administration was as follows: liver 577+/- 13, small intestine 631 +/- 25, large intestine 696 +/- 19, and kidney 1964 +/- 220. Twenty-four hours after application on normal skin the tissue distribution was as follows: liver 6 +/- 4, small intestine 99 +/- 22, large intestine 107 +/- 24, and kidneys 29 +/- 12. Twenty-four hours after application on abraded skin the tissue distribution was as follows: liver 139 +/- 34, small intestine 214 +/- 76, large intestine 309 +/- 115, and kidneys 222 +/- 30.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer saftey standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, disodium salt is found on List D. Case No: 4036; Pesticide type: insecticide, fungicide, herbicide, antimicrobial; Case Status: None of the active ingredients in the case are being supported for reregistration by their registrants. All are unsupported, or some are unsupported and some are cancelled.

Children and adults have mistakenly received edetate disodium instead of edetate calcium disodium; at least 5 deaths have occurred as a result of inadvertent administration of edetate disodium. Although both edetate calcium disodium and edetate disodium are heavy metal antagonists, the 2 drugs were originally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for different uses and have different effects; edetate disodium was formerly FDA approved for use in selected patients for the emergency treatment of hypercalcemia or for the control of ventricular arrhythmias associated with cardiac glycoside toxicity. Use of edetate disodium may result in a substantial, and sometimes fatal, decrease in serum calcium concentrations. In June 2008, FDA withdrew its prior approval for edetate disodium because of safety concerns following a review of the risk-benefit profile of the drug. FDA stated that it was not considering additional action regarding edetate calcium disodium at that time; most of the fatalities following administration of an EDTA drug have involved medication errors in which edetate disodium was administered instead of edetate calcium disodium. FDA has not received reports of any fatalities resulting from the administration of edetate calcium disodium that involve a medication error.",

To avoid the production of \"high reactions\", the test material was applied progressively from 15 to 30 minutes to 4 hour.

Each patient received 0.5 g/30 lb body weight dissolved in 500 cc of 5% glucose water and infused slowly over an hour. The total dose ranged from 132 to 212 g. Side effects were minimal and did not require discontinuation of therapy. Eight patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) served as untreated histologic controls. Five patients served as untreated chemical controls and skin from the forearms of 11 individuals without scleroderma were also chemically analyzed. The four patients treated with Disodium EDTA cooperated well and had subjective and objective softening of the skin. At microscopic examination, untreated cases of scleroderma had severe changes. Three of the four patients treated with Disodium EDTA had a return toward normal in their skin. All EDTA cases had definite softening of the skin clinically. Microscopically, this was observed as increased vascularity, return of fixed tissue cells, and the loosening of the collagen bundles in the dermis and the stratum corneum of the epidermis. Normal calcium values from the 11 donors were not statistically significant from the scleroderma average. The magnesium values for the normal donors were 0.19 +/- 0.05 pg/mg dry tissue and for the scleroderma group, 0.17 +/- 0.05 pg/mg dry tissue.",

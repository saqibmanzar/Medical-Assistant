For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Only 3% was excreted with the feces, suggesting that there is intestinal reabsorption of a portion of the methylmelamines passing into the bile. Conjugates of methylmelamines with glucuronic acid or sulphate were found only in minute quantities in the urine or bile of rats treated with hexamethylmelamine or pentamethylmelamine.

Two main mechanisms have been proposed and explored: (i) formation of a reactive iminium species forming covalent adducts with DNA; and (ii) local formaldehyde release leading to cytotoxic damage. 32P-postlabelling and thermal denaturation experiments showed these compounds to be interactive with cytosine and guanine. Trimelamol gave rise to DNA-interstrand crosslinks in naked plasmid DNA and in cultured cell lines, whereas the analogues failed to do so under a variety of experimental conditions. Along with our observations that cell lines with acquired resistance to the N-(hydroxymethyl)melamines showed no significant cross-resistance to classical bifunctional alkylating agents, DNA crosslinking may play only a minor role in their mechanism of action. In cultured cell lines treatment with formaldehyde, trimelamol and CB 7639 gave rise to high levels of DNA-protein crosslinks with a gradual disappearance over a 24 hr period. Along with ... earlier observations that resistance to trimelamol coincides with cross-resistance to formaldehyde, /investigators/ conclude that formaldehyde-release may be an important factor in their cytotoxicity. Further, the cytotoxicity of trimelamol or formaldehyde towards human ovarian cancer cells was not influenced by glutathione depletion. /N-(hydroxymethyl)melamines/",

Daily po treatment of male rats for 62 days with doses of 0, 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/day resulted in testicular atrophy, reduced fertility, and a possible dominant lethal mutagenic effect at the higher two dose levels. Alterations in morphology and function of the beta cells of the pancreatic islets were observed after treatment of males for more than 28 days with 20 or 40 mg/kg/day. The same dose levels administered to female rats for 14 days prior to breeding and through Day 13 or 20 of gestation had no adverse effects on fertility, but the highest dose was embryocidal and postnatal survival was decreased at both the 20- and 40-mg/kg/day dose levels. Similar effects on postnatal survival were observed when the drug was administered by gavage to rats during the last week of gestation and throughout the lactation period. Treatment of pregnant rats throughout organogenesis (Days 6 to 15) or for 4-day intervals during organogenesis (Days 6 to 9, 9 to 12, or 12 to 15) with po doses ranging from 20 to 80 mg/kg/day resulted in decreased body weight gain and food consumption, an increased resorption rate in dams receiving 80 mg/kg/day on Days 6 to 9, and decreased fetal weights at all dose levels and most treatment intervals. The incidence of minor skeletal defects was increased among litters of HMM-treated groups. Major fetal malformations were limited in number but were considered treatment related. Treatment of pregnant rabbits po on Days 6 to 18 of gestation with doses of 0, 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg/day did not result in an embryocidal or teratogenic effect. Treatment with 60 mg/kg/day did, however, result in decreased kit weights, indicating a mild embryo-fetotoxic effect.",

A useful and informative approach to this problem is the analysis of the mutation spectra induced by these drugs in eukaryotic organisms. Sequence analysis of the mutations induced by hexamethylmelamine, a crosslinking agent extensively used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, in male germ cells of Drosophila was conducted using the v locus as reporter gene. Both intra-locus and multi-locus deletions were induced whereas based changes were almost absent. Thus, it is proposed that deletions are likely to be involved in the generation of second malignancies in hexamethylmelamine-treated patients. It has to be stressed that systems, such as v, capable of efficiently recovering mutations caused by big losses of DNA, should be used for the study of mutational spectra induced by cross-linking agents.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

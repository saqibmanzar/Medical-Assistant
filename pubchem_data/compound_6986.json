When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Two different procedures were carried out to test the activity of these compounds by direct contact and by inhalation. In the direct contact assays five different quantities of each undiluted substance (6, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 ul) were spread on the internal surface of 6-cm petri dishes, each containing 10 mites. The activity by inhalation was tested using two petri dishes of different sizes: the smaller one (6 cm), containing 10 mites, was covered with a filter paper disk and enclosed in a bigger dish (9 cm) containing 6 oz 2 mul of each undiluted substance. At the highest doses, the essential oils of the two lavender species and of peppermint killed 100% of the mites, both by direct contact and by inhalation. Eucalyptus oil was the least active. Among the essential oil constituents, menthol showed the highest activity, killing 100% of the mites at the lowest dose (0.25 ul) by direct contact and at 6 ul by inhalation. However, linalool, fenchone, and menthone also showed good acaricidal activity. Eucalyptol, like the essential oil of which it is the principal constituent, had the lowest activity.",

After 19 days the dose was reduced to 400 mg/kg bw in the female group receiving the highest dose. Analyses of plasma showed a dose-dependent decrease in creatinine content and a dose-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and bilirubin. The relative weights of liver and spleen were increased. Cyst-like spaces were seen histopathologically in the white matter of the cerebellum of the two highest dose groups. The no-effect level for menthone in this study was lower than 200 mg/kg bw/day.",

Menthone is found naturally in many essential oils, such as pennyroyal, peppermint and geranium. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.28 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates menthone will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase menthone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 hours. If released to soil, menthone is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 120. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Menthone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, menthone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half- lives for a model river and model lake are 0.5 and 8 days, respectively. The potential for bioconcentration is considered low based upon an estimated BCF value of 15. Occupational exposure to menthone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where menthone is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to menthone through dermal contact with perfumes and ingestion of products containing menthone. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

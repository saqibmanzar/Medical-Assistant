ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Animals at the highest dose level experienced tremors and 5 mortalities. The incidence of micronucleated cells were analyzed in 1000 polychromatic erythrocytes per animal. The incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes and the ratio of normochromatic to polychromatic erythrocytes were comparable to the vehicle control (corn oil).",

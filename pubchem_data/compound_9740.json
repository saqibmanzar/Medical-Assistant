For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In vivo and in vitro metabolism of 3-dimethylaminopropionitrile (DMAPN) and its urotoxic effect on male Sprague-Dawley rats /were investigated/. Rats were given 175, 350, or 525 mg/kg DMAPN or DMAPN metabolites orally for 5 days, and urinary metabolites and volumes were measured. By day 5, 44% of the DMAPN dose was excreted unchanged.  Beta-aminopropionitrile and cyanoacetic acid were the major urinary metabolites, as identified by gas chromatography. /It was/ concluded that DMAPN is metabolized via a cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system and the urotoxic effects of DMAPN may be related to its metabolism.",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.035 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cyanoacetic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase cyanoacetic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 25 days. If released to soil, cyanoacetic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. The pKa of cyanoacetic acid is 2.45, which indicates it will exist as an anion under environmental conditions. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces will not be an important fate process because anions do not volatilize. Cyanoacetic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Cyanoacetic acid was readily degraded in 2 weeks in a screening test that used an activated sludge inoculum, suggesting that it will be susceptible to biodegradation in the environment. If released into water, cyanoacetic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization will not be an important fate process in water since anions do not volatilize. Cyanoacetic acid is highly reactive in chlorinated waters such as municipal drinking water systems, rapidly degrading to dichloroacetic acid, dichloromalonic acid, and trichloroacetic acid at pH range of 4 to 10. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to cyanoacetic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyanoacetic acid is produced or used. (SRC)",

Furthermore, the pka of cyanoacetic acid is 2.45(3), indicating it will exist as an anion under environmental conditions and anions generally have greater mobility in soils than neutral compounds(4). Volatilization from moist soil surfaces will not be an important environmental fate process since anions do not volatilize(SRC). The potential for volatilization of cyanoacetic acid from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 0.035 mm Hg determined from a fragment constant method(5). Cyanoacetic acid was readily degraded in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum and the Japanese MITI test, suggesting that it will be susceptible to biodegradation in soil(6).",

The pka of cyanoacetic acid is 2.45(3), indicating it will exist as an anion under environmental conditions. Volatilization from water surfaces is not an important environmental fate process since anions do not volatilize(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from a log Kow of -0.76(5) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Cyanoacetic acid is highly reactive in chlorinated water, rapidly degrading to dichloroacetic acid, dichloromalonic acid, and trichloroacetic acid at pH 4-10(7). Cyanoacetic acid was readily degraded in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum and the Japanese MITI test, suggesting that it will be susceptible to biodegradation in water(8).",

Vapor-phase cyanoacetic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 25 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.5X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

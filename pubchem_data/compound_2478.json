ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Hepatic veno-occlusive disease diagnosed by clinical examination and laboratory findings occurred in 8% (5/61) of patients receiving IV busulfan in the allogeneic transplant clinical trial and was fatal in 40% (2/5) of cases. Overall mortality from hepatic veno-occlusive disease was 3% for the entire study population. Retrospectively, 3 of the 5 patients diagnosed with hepatic veno-occlusive disease were found to meet the Jones' criteria for this condition. In patients receiving high-dose oral busulfan as a component of a conditioning regimen prior to bone marrow transplant in randomized, controlled studies, the incidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease was 7.7-12%.",

Busulfan-induced pancytopenia may be more prolonged than that induced by other alkylating agents; although recovery may take 1 month to 2 years, the toxicity is potentially reversible and patients should be vigorously supported through any period of severe pancytopenia.

Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn leads to a miscoding of DNA. Alkylating agents are cell cycle-nonspecific and work by three different mechanisms, all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death. Overexpression of MGST2, a glutathione s-transferase, is thought to confer resistance to busulfan. The role of MGST2 in the metabolism of busulfan is unknown however.",

In humans, as in the rat, almost all of the radioactivity in (35)S-labeled busulfan is excreted in the urine in the form of (35)S-methanesulfonic acid. /It was/ demonstrated that the formation of methanesulfonic acid in vivo in the rat is not due to a simple hydrolysis of busulfan to 1,4-butanediol, since only about 4% of 2,3-(14)C-busulfan was excreted as carbon dioxide, whereas 2,3-(14)C-1,4-butanediol was converted almost exclusively to carbon dioxide. The predominant reaction of busulfan in the rat is the alkylation of sulfhydryl groups (particularly cysteine and cysteine-containing compounds) to produce a cyclic sulfonium compound which is the precursor of the major urinary metabolite of the 4-carbon portion of the molecule, 3-hydroxytetrahydrothiophene-1,1-dioxide. This has been termed a \"sulfur-stripping\" action of busulfan and it may modify the function of certain sulfur-containing amino acids, polypeptides, and proteins; whether this action makes an important contribution to the cytotoxicity of busulfan is unknown.",

For 72 hours, the urinary recovery of (14)C was approximately 70% of the total dose, while the fecal excretion was within the range 1.5-2%. The pattern of the urinary metabolites of busulfan was studied by HPLC in combination with radioactivity detection of the pooled urine. At least eight radioactive fractions could be separated. Three major metabolite peaks were identified by GC/MS and NMR spectroscopy: 3-hydroxysulfolane (39% of total urine radioactivity), tetrahydrothiophene 1- oxide (20%), and sulfolane (13%). Busulfan (6%) and tetrahydrofuran (2%) were also identified. A sulfonium ion glutathione conjugate was hypothesised as another metabolite, but was not isolated because it was very unstable. However, another compound was observed. This metabolite co-eluted with the sulfonium ion obtained of the reaction of busulfan with N-acetyl-L-cysteine and produced tetrahydrothiophene when hydrolyzed. Finally, busulfan and the three main metabolites were tested for cytotoxicity on Chinese V79 hamster cells in vitro. Cell toxicity was induced only by busulfan, which indicates that the cytotoxicity in vivo is mediated by the parent compound, as expected.",

Busulfan is predominantly metabolized by conjugation with glutathione, both spontaneously and by glutathione S-transferase (GST) catalysis. GSTA1 is the primary GST isoform that facilitates the the metabolism of busulfan. Other GST isoforms that are also involved are GSTM1 and GSTP1. At least 12 metabolites have been identified among which tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrothiophene 12-oxide, sulfolane, and 3-hydroxysulfolane were identified. These metabolites do not have cytotoxic activity. \nRoute of Elimination: Following administration of 14C- labeled busulfan to humans, approximately 30% of the radioactivity was excreted into the urine over 48 hours; negligible amounts were recovered in feces. Less than 2% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine unchanged within 24 hours. Elimination of busulfan is independent of renal function. \nHalf Life: 2.6 hours",

                        "Description": "In medicine, the term \"mechanism of action\" (also called MOA) is used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Once busulfan is hydrolyzed, the methanesulfonate groups are released and carbonium ions are produced. These carbonium ions alkylate DNA, which results in the interference of DNA replication and RNA transcription, ultimately leading to the disruption of nucleic acid function. Specifically, its mechanism of action through alkylation produces guanine-adenine intrastrand crosslinks. These crosslinks occur through a SN2 reaction guanine N7 nucleophilically attacks the carbon adjacent to the mesylate leaving group. This kind of damage cannot be repaired by cellular machinery and thus the cell undergoes apoptosis.",

With regard to DNA, busulfan reacts with guanine residues to form a fourcarbon di-guanine DNA cross-linkage with release of methylsulfonate. The DNA cross-linkage causes misreading of the DNA code and single-strand breakage. The degree of DNA cross-linkage has been shown to be proportional to the dose and cytotoxicity of the compound. Busulfan-induced crosslinkages of DNA to nuclear proteins may also occur and is considered a cytotoxic mechanism. Busulfan has also been reported to esterify phosphate groups of chromosomal DNA, accounting for the fragmentation of chromosomes seen in various cell types after treatment. Chromosomal damage further contributes to the overall cytotoxic effect.",

While busulfan can act on cells at any stage of mitosis, similar to other alkylating agents, in vitro studies with tumour cell lines indicate that replicating cells are most sensitive to busulfan in the late G1 phase and that progression through the cell cycle is blocked in the G2 phase. Cultured cells in the S-phase, which involves DNA synthesis, are not as affected because the DNA repair systems are active at this stage. Clinically, busulfan is cytotoxic to proliferating tissues, especially granulopoietic cells in the bone marrow.",

Once busulfan is hydrolyzed, the methanesulfonate groups are released and carbonium ions are produced. These carbonium ions alkylate DNA, which results in the interference of DNA replication and RNA transcription, ultimately leading to the disruption of nucleic acid function. Specifically, its mechanism of action through alkylation produces guanine-adenine intrastrand crosslinks. This occurs through an SN2 reaction in which the relatively nucleophilic guanine N7 attacks the carbon adjacent to the mesylate leaving group. This kind of damage cannot be repaired by cellular machinery and thus the cell undergoes apoptosis.",

This process also arises at least six months if not years of therapy with busulfan or antimetabolites (azathioprine, thioguanine) and typically presents with signs of portal hypertension (varices, variceal hemorrhage, ascites) and minimal, nonspecific symptoms and serum enzyme elevations. Thrombocytopenia is almost always present and is often the first sign of evolving portal hypertension. Nodular regeneration usually starts to improve within a few weeks to months of stopping the antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapy. However, in some cases the complications of portal hypertension are severe and can result in hepatic failure particularly if complicated by septicemia or other organ failure (Case 2).",

The onset of injury is usually within 10 to 20 days of HCT and presents with abdominal pain, liver tenderness, weight gain due to fluid accumulation, and jaundice. With some newer conditioning regimens, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome can present later, 30 to 75 days after HCT. The serum enzymes are usually elevated, typically with marked increases in serum aminotransferase levels (and lactic dehydrogenase), but minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase. In severe cases, there is hepatomegaly and ascites and signs of hepatic failure arise. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome tends to be severe and the fatality rate can be as high as 50%. Poor prognostic signs are marked increases in serum ALT levels and high bilirubin levels. In fatal instances, death from multiorgan failure arises within days to weeks of onset. In cases with spontaneous recovery, there may be residual fibrosis or nodular regeneration. Autoantibody formation and allergic manifestations are uncommon, although fever may be present at onset. Risk factors for the development of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome are higher doses of busulfan, combination with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, pharmacokinetics that favor higher busulfan or cyclophosphamide exposure, and preexisting liver disease, particularly chronic hepatitis C. The frequency of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome after HCT ranges from 20% to 50%, but its incidence has decreased markedly in recent years with use of less aggressive conditioning regimens, better control over drug dosing, and lower frequency of hepatitis C (with elimination of posttransfusion hepatitis after anti-HCV testing of all blood donors).",

Patients treated with concomitant cyclophosphamide and busulfan with phenytoin pretreatment have increased cyclophosphamide and busulfan clearance, which may lead to decreased concentrations of both cyclophosphamide and busulfan. However, busulfan clearance may be reduced in the presence of cyclophosphamide alone, presumably due to competition for glutathione.",

She received 212 mg/day of busulfan for only 4 days. Ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated a posterior polar subcapsular opacity of the lens in both eyes. Although the occurrence of cataract due to busulfan has been reported after long-term administration of busulfan, this is the first clinical case of cataract caused by high doses of busulfan for a short period. It is necessary to pay more attention to busulfan cataract.",

The slower reproducing hematopoietic stem cells (identified as spleen colony forming units in assays) were reduced following acute exposure to busulfan. The more differentiated precursor cells developing into granulocytes and erythrocytes were reduced to a lesser extent. In addition to reducing the number of stem cells, there is evidence that a proportion of those stem cells surviving acute busulfan exposure have an altered capacity to produce differentiated progeny as a result of genetic damage.",

Other groups received Myleran in the vehicle without irradiation, or vehicle only. A group of 314 mice served as untreated controls.

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

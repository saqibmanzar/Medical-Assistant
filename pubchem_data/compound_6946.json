When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The results of the published studies on 2-nitroaniline did not show significant increases of methemoglobin in animals except in the inhalation study. This difference with other isomers or inducers seems to be due to the difference of chemical reactivity of the nitro substitution in position 2 compared to other substitutions. 2-Nitroaniline is metabolised in vitro by rabbit liver microsomes to 4-amino-3-nitrophenol. 2-nitroaniline has been shown to have an oral LD50 value of 1838 mg/kg b/w in the rat, this is the only acute effect noted. It is not irritating to skin and to the eyes, and not sensitizing. In oral repeated administration a NOEL of 50 mg/kg bw/day was determined from a 9 weeks study. The major treatment -related effects are clinical signs, but not methemoglobinemia, and weight loss. In a vapor inhalation 28 day assay a NOAEL was determined at 10 mg/cu m in rats, due to slight methemoglobinemia and hematological effects seen at 90 mg/cu m. 2-Nitroaniline was shown to be non-mutagenic in relevant bacterial studies. Nonetheless, a weak mutagenic influence was reported in some studies in which tests were performed on S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA1538 in the presence of Hamster S9 mix or with Flavin Mononucleotide activation. Investigations of general interaction with DNA on bacteria (E.coli) yielded negative results, as well as in vitro UDS tests and in vivo clastogenicity tests (micronucleus i.p.) or test on the alkaline elution behaviour of the DNA. In conclusion, 2-nitroaniline is not mutagenic. In reproduction and developmental toxicological studies, the substance caused neither teratogenic nor fertility effects, but did cause developmental effects due to pups lethality at 450 mg/kg bw /day where a maternal body weight decrease occurred. The NOAEL for developmental effects was 150 mg/kg bw/day and the maternal NOAEL was set at 50 mg /kg bw in a study according to OECD TG 422. ENVIRONMENT. 2-Nitroaniline has been found to be non-biodegradable, even in high inoculum concentration conditions. It therefore can be considered as persistent. The highest bioconcentration factor in fish was observed to be 8, leading to the conclusion that 2-nitroaniline does not significantly bioaccumulate. The most valid and lowest E(L)C 50 found were a LC 50 (96 hours) in Brachydanio rerio of 19.5 mg/l, an EC 50 (24 hours) in Daphnia magna of 8.3 mg/l and an EC50 (growth rate, 72 hours) in Selenastrum capricornutum was > 100 mg/l. The lowest result is the EC 50 (24 hours) in Daphnia magna. Using an extrapolation factor of 1000, a PNEC of 0.008 mg/l can be estimated for the aquatic compartment.",

Animals were observed daily for clinical signs; body weights recorded on days 3, 7 and 14. Clinical observations were consistent with a Functional Observational Battery set of indices; methemoglobin determinations were made following exposure. All rats underwent a gross necropsy at study term. Food and water were given ad libitum. Observation period was 14 days. A vehicle control group of rats was exposed similarly to polyethylene glycol/acetone. ... Limit test: No deaths occurred at the maximum achievable level tested of 2,529 mg/m3 (analytical level); the MMAD was 2.1 um indicating particle sizes of a respirable range. Animals exposed at this level exhibited decrements in body weight gain, hypothermia, distinct discoloration of the urine, and bradypnea, all of which were attributed to test article.

Biotransformation products of anilines in the zebrafish were analyzed by HPLC. The aim of the investigations was to find relationships between accumulation/elimination/metabolism and toxicity on the one hand and between chemical structure and biotransformation on the other. ... A good correlation of log BCF and of log Pow with log LC50 /was found/. This concurs with the assumption that the internal dose determines the toxicological effect. All anilines investigated, with the exception of 2- and 4-nitroaniline, were transformed into the corresponding acetanilides. The toxicity of the compounds was not altered by biotransformation. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.77X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-nitroaniline will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-nitroaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 29 hours. 2-Nitroaniline does absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-nitroaniline is expected to have high mobility based upon a Koc of 59. However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.9X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. A number of screening studies using soil, activated sludge, sewage and water have found 2-nitroaniline to be generally resistant to biodegradation. If released into water, 2-nitroaniline is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. In the water column, 2-nitroaniline may be susceptible to significant degradation in sunlight via reaction with photochemically produced oxidants such as hydroxyl and alkoxy radicals. BCFs of <10 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-nitroaniline may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-nitroaniline is produced or used. (SRC)",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 29 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 2-Nitroaniline is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Aromatic amines react relatively rapidly in natural water with photochemically produced oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals and alkoxy radicals(3); half-lives of aniline are on the order of 30 hr of sunlight for hydroxyl radicals and 19 hr of sunlight for alkoxy radicals(3); reactions with 2-nitroaniline are likely to be somewhat slower due to the presence of the nitro function(SRC). 2-Nitroaniline does absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In acute oral BASTA poisoning, patients develop a variety of  clinical signs, including disturbed consciousness, convulsions, & apnea.

He developed not only unconsciousness, respiratory distress, &   convulsions but also an incr in urine output (7885 mL/d), elevated serum sodium (167 mEq/L),   elevated plasma osmolality (332 mOsm/kg), & a decr in both urine osmolality (200 mOsm/kg) &   urine specific gravity (1.003), which suggested the development of diabetes insipidus. The   plasma level of antidiuretic hormone remained within the normal range (1.3 pg/mL), despite   high plasma osmolality. The admin of desmopressin was successful in normalizing urine volume,  specific gravity, & osmolality. Serum sodium corrected gradually within 48 hrs. /BASTA/",

Her serum CK increased to a peak of 24,900 IU/L on the third day of admission. An 87-yr-old male was admitted to the emergency department 3-1/2 hrs after taking 200 ml of BASTA and receiving gastric lavage at a local emergency room. On arrival he was conscious, and serial activated charcoal and hemodialysis was performed. Blood concn of glufosinate ammonium after hemodialysis decreased from 1.56 ug/ml to 0.68 ug/ml. Thirty hours after admission he had general convulsions. Glufosinate ammonium was not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid 6 hr after the convulsions. His serum CK increased to a peak of 17,870 IU/L on the 5th day of admission. /BASTA/",

The patient suffered mental disturbances and hematological changes together with   GI effects  shortly after ingesting the poison, and later developed generalized  convulsions,  impaired  respiration and circulatory failure. During recovery he exhibited loss  of short-term  memory  (retrograde and anterograde amnesia). Neurotoxicity is a characteristic  of glufosinate   poisoning, although the mechanism is not clear. From the analysis of clinical  symptoms of   previously published cases, glufosinate toxicity appears to arise both from the  active   ingredient and the surfactant in the formulation. /PHOSPHINOTHRICIN/",

Because of the structural similarities between glufosinate & glutamate,  the convulsion induced   by glufosinate-ammonium may be ascribed to glutamate receptor  activation. Three   N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, dizocilpine, LY235959,  and Compound 40, & an   alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid  (AMPA)/kainate receptor antagonist,   NBQX, were coadmin with glufosinate-ammonium (80 mg/kg,  intraperitoneally) in mice.   Statistical analyses showed that the NMDA receptor antagonists  markedly inhibited the   convulsions, while the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist had no effect  on the convulsion. These   results suggest that the convulsion caused by glufosinate-ammonium  is mediated through NMDA   receptors.",

                        "Description": "This section provides information to evaluate the environmental impact of the chemical if it were released to the environment. The information may include data from toxicity tests performed on aquatic and/or terrestrial organisms, where available (e.g., acute or chronic aquatic toxicity data for fish, algae, and crustaceans; toxicity data on birds, bees, and plants).  This section also includes information on whether there is a potential for the chemical to persist or degrade in the environment either through biodegradation or other processes (such as oxidation or hydrolysis) as well as the concentration or amount of the chemical found in the environment (e.g., in plants, animals as well as in the atmosphere or water).",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.1X10-12 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates glufosinate-ammonium will exist solely in particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase glufosinate-ammonium will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, glufosinate-ammonium is expected to have high to low soil mobility based on Koc values of 9.6 to 1,229. Field studies have indicated that glufosinate-ammonium rarely migrates below 10-15 cm in soil, presumably because of rapid microbial degradation. Microbial degradation is the primary degradation process in soil and occurs rapidly with transformation to 3-methylphosphinyl-propionic acid and 2-methylphosphinyl-acetic acid and ultimately to carbon dioxide. The aerobic half-life in soil is typically 3-11 days with an anaerobic half-life of 5-10 days. Field dissipation half-lives of 6-20 days (avg 13 days) are reported. A laboratory batch and in situ microcosm study demonstrated that glufosinate-ammonium can be persistent and transported in an aquifer with relatively low clay content and little labile organic carbon. If released into water, glufosinate-ammonium is expected to have low to high adsorption to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis and photolysis in water are not expected to be important fate processes with half-lives of greater than 300 days. Occupational exposure to glufosinate-ammonium may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where glufosinate-ammonium is produced or used. (SRC)",

Field studies have indicated that glufosinate-ammonium rarely leaches below 10-15 cm in soil(3,4), presumably because of rapid microbial degradation(3). Microbial degradation occurs rapidly in soil with transformation to 3-methylphosphinyl-propionic acid and 2-methylphosphinyl-acetic acid and ultimately to carbon dioxide(4-6). The aerobic half-life in soil is typically 3-11 days(2,4-6) with an anaerobic half-life of 5-10 days(2). Field dissipation half-lives 6-20 days (avg 13 days) are reported(2). A laboratory batch and in situ microcosm study(7) demonstrated that glufosinate-ammonium can be persistent and transported in an aquifer with relatively low clay content and little labile organic carbon.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

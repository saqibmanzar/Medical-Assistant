When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Toxic by inhalation and ingestion, exposure to this crystalline substance may occur from its use in the manufacture of thermosetting resins, and as a chemical intermediate for pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and dyestuffs. In activities and situations where over exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and personal protective clothing. If contact should occur, immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. While this substance does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of irritating and poisonous gases. For fires involving this substance, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, fog, or standard foam. This substance may be shipped via air, rail, road, and water, in containers bearing the label \"Poison\". Small dry spills of this substance may be placed into a clean, dry, covered container for later disposal (liquid solutions are first absorbed in sand or other noncombustible absorbent). Large liquid spills should be diked far ahead to prevent this substance from entering water sources and sewers. Before implementing land disposal of this substance, consult with regulatory agencies for guidance.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.2X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.4 days. Particulate-phase 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine will be physically removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 130. Volatilization from moist and dry soil surfaces is not expected to occur based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole and this compound's vapor pressure, respectively. No biodegradation data for 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine were available, but triazines, in general, are slowly biodegraded. If released into water, 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to occur based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 6.4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine may occur through inhalation of dust particles and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine is used.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Adsorption of 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine, 5X10-5 M, by Na-montmorillonite at four pH levels was approximately 310 umol/g at pH 1, 460 umol/g at pH 2, 475 umol/g at pH 4, and 200 umol/g at pH 6.5; maximum adsorption by the clay occurred at pH levels in the vicinity of the pKa, 3.7(4). This compound's pKa of 3.7(4), indicates it will exist predominately in the unionized form under environmental pHs(SRC). Weak bases, such as 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine, are more mobile in alkaline soils because cations are much more strongly adsorbed by ion exchange on organic and inorganic surfaces than the unionized bases are by organic matter(5).",

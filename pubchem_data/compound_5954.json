PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Since the expression of some of these is regulated in a gender-specific manner and may be altered by age, rat strain or by phenobarbital treatment, the effects of these variables on metabolism of BA to diols was investigated. These studies used hepatic, microsomal membranes from immature and adult Long-Evans rats and adult Hooded Lister rats. BA-diols were resolved by normal phase HPLC into three discrete peaks identified as benz[a]anthracene-5,6-diol (BA-5,6-diol), benz[a]anthracene-10, 11-diol (BA-10,11-diol) and a mixture of benz[a]anthracene-3,4- and -8,9-diols (BA-3,4-diol and BA-8,9-diol and termed Peak(3/8)). Significant gender-related differences were found in the rates of diol formation in adults of both the Long-Evans and Hooded Lister rat strains. Formation of BA-10,11-diol and to a lesser extent the components of Peak(3/8) were greater in the male compared to female animals by factors of at least 14 and two, respectively. An age-dependent effect is also observed in the Long-Evans rat since these differences are still apparent in prepubertal animals but to a lesser extent (gender ratio male:female BA-10,11-diol 9X; Peak(3/8) 1.4X). In contrast BA-5,6-diol was formed at similar rates by membranes from female and male rats whether mature (Long-Evans and Hooded Lister) or immature (Long-Evans). Phenobarbital treatment of the adult Long-Evans rats resulted in a moderate increase in the formation of each diol other than at the 10,11-position and the induction was not gender specific. The rate of formation of BA-10, 11-diol was decreased in phenobarbital-treated male rats suggesting modulation of a male specific isoform. Measurement of microsomal epoxide hydrolase revealed no gender or age differences and suggests that this enzyme is not rate limiting in BA-diol formation and thus is not responsible for the differences in BA-diol formation observed. The results suggest that CYP2C11 along with a male-specific isoenzyme not regulated by age are important in the formation of BA-10,11-diol and a component(s) of Peak(3/8) in males. CYPs 2B2 and/or 2C6 appear to be involved in formation of BA-5,6-diol in male and female. ...",

PAH carcinogenesis is explained by DNA adduct formation by PAH diol epoxide and oxidative DNA damage by PAH o-quinone. Benz[a]anthracene-trans-3,4-dihydrodiol (BA-3,4-dihydrodiol) is a minor metabolite but shows higher mutagenicity and tumorigenicity than parent BA. We confirmed that a BA o-quinone type metabolite, benz[a]anthracene-3,4-dione (BA-3,4-dione), induced oxidative DNA damage in the presence of cytochrome P450 reductase. ... We found that BA-3,4-dihydrodiol nonenzymatically caused Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage including 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine formation and the addition of NADH enhanced DNA damage. BA-3,4-dihydrodiol induced a double-base lesion of C and G at the 5'-ACG-3' sequence complementary to codon 273 of the human p53 tumor suppressor gene, which is known as a hotspot. The DNA damage was inhibited by catalase and bathocuproine, indicating the involvement of H(2)O(2) and Cu(I). Time-of-flight mass spectroscopic study suggested that BA-3,4-dihydrodiol undergoes Cu(II)-mediated autoxidation leading to the formation of its hydroxylated form of BA-3,4-dihydrodiol, capable of causing oxidative DNA damage. It is noteworthy that BA-3,4-dihydrodiol can nonenzymatically induce DNA damage more efficiently than BA-3,4-dione with metabolic activation. In conclusion, oxidative DNA damage induced by BA-3,4-dihydrodiol not only via quinone-type redox cycle but also via a new type of redox cycle participates in the expression of carcinogenicity of BA and BA-3,4-dihydrodiol.",

Neutral and acidic ethyl acetate extractable metabolites were isolated and characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and uv-visible absorption, gas chromatography/mass (GC/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral analysis. Trimethylsilylation of the metabolites followed by GC/MS analysis facilitated identification of metabolites. The characterization of metabolites indicated that M. vanbaalenii initiated attack of benz[a]anthracene at the C-1,2-, C-5,6-, C-7,12- and C-10,11-positions to form dihydroxylated and methoxylated intermediates. The major site of enzymatic attack was in the C-10, C-11 positions. Subsequent ortho- and meta-cleavage of each of the aromatic rings led to the accumulation of novel ring-fission metabolites in the medium. The major metabolites identified were 3-hydrobenzo[f]isobenzofuran-1-one (3.2%), 6-hydrofuran[3,4-g]chromene-2,8-dione (1.3%), benzo[g]chromene-2-one (1.7%), naphtho[2,1-g]chromen-10-one (48.1%), 10-hydroxy-11-methoxybenz[a]anthracene (9.3%), and 10,11-dimethoxybenz[a]anthracene (36.4%). Enzymatic attack at the C-7 and C-12 positions resulted in the formation of benz[a]anthracene-7,12-dione, 1-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)-2-naphthoic acid, and 1-benzoyl-2-naphthoic acid. A phenyl-naphthyl metabolite, 3-(2-carboxylphenyl)-2-naphthoic acid, was formed when M. vanbaalenii was incubated with benz[a]anthracene cis-5,6-dihydrodiol, indicating ortho-cleavage of 5,6-dihydroxybenz[a]anthracene. A minor amount of 5,6-dimethoxybenz[a]anthracene was also formed. The data extend and propose novel pathways for the bacterial metabolism of benz[a]anthracene.",

At the first step of metabolization, benz[a]anthracene was transformed via a typical pathway of ligninolytic fungi to benz[a]anthracene-7,12-dione (BaAQ). The product was further transformed by at least two ways, whereas one is complied with the anthracene metabolic pathway of I. lacteus. Benz[a]anthracene-7,12-dione was degraded to 1,2-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid and phthalic acid that was followed with production of 2-hydroxymethyl benzoic acid or monomethyl and dimethylesters of phthalic acid. Another degradation product of BaAQ was identified as 1-tetralone. Its transformation via 1,4-naphthalenedione, 1,4-naphthalenediol and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-hydroxynaphthalene resulted again in phthalic acid. None of the intermediates were identified as dead-end metabolites. ...",

We investigated role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in disruption of contact inhibition in rat liver epithelial WB-F344 'stem-like' cells, induced by the weakly mutagenic benz[a]anthracene (BaA), benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) and by the strongly mutagenic benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). There were significant differences between the effects of BaA and BbF, and those of the strongly genotoxic BaP. Both BaA and BbF increased percentage of cells entering S-phase and cell numbers, associated with an increased expression of Cyclin A and Cyclin A/cdk2 complex activity. Their effects were significantly reduced in cells expressing a dominant-negative AhR mutant (dnAhR). Roscovitine, a chemical inhibitor of cdk2, abolished the induction of cell proliferation by BbF. However, neither BaA nor BbF modulated expression of the principal cdk inhibitor involved in maintenance of contact inhibition, p27(Kip1), or pRb phosphorylation. The strongly mutagenic BaP induced apoptosis, a decrease in total cell numbers and significantly higher percentage of cells entering S-phase than either BaA or BbF. Given that BaP induced high levels of Cyclin A/cdk2 activity, downregulation of p27(Kip1) and hyperphosphorylation of pRb, the accumulation of cells in S-phase was probably due to cell proliferation, although S-phase arrest due to blocked replication forks can not be excluded. Both types of effects of BaP were significantly attenuated in dnAhR cells. Transfection of WB-F344 cells with siRNA targeted against AhR decreased induction of Cyclin A induced by BbF or BaP, further supporting the role of AhR in proliferative effects of PAHs. This suggest that activation of AhR plays a significant role both in disruption of contact inhibition by weakly mutagenic PAHs and in genotoxic effects of BaP possibly leading to enhanced cell proliferation. Thus, PAHs may increase proliferative rate and the likelihood of fixation of mutations.",

Although various classes of AhR ligands may differentially activate human and rodent AhR, there is presently a lack of data on the human AhR-inducing relative potencies (REPs) of PAHs. Here, we focused on estimation of the AhR-mediated activities of a large set of environmental PAHs in human gene reporter AZ-AhR cell line, with an aim to develop the human AhR-based REP values with potential implications for risk assessment of PAHs. The previously identified weakly active PAHs mostly failed to activate the AhR in human cells. The order for REPs of individual PAHs in human cells largely corresponded with the available data from rodent-based experimental systems; nevertheless, we identified differences up to one order of magnitude in REP values of PAHs between human and rodent cells. Higher REP values were found in human cells for some important environmental contaminants or suspected carcinogens, such as indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, benz[a]anthracene or benzo[b]fluoranthene, while lower REP values were determined for methyl-substituted PAHs. Our results also indicate that a different rate of metabolism for individual PAHs in human vs. rodent cells may affect estimation of REP values in human cell-based assay, and potentially alter toxicity of some compounds, such as benzofluoranthenes, in humans. We applied the AZ-AhR assay to evaluation of the AhR-mediated activity of complex mixtures of organic compounds associated with diesel exhaust particles, and we identified the polar compounds present in these mixtures as being particularly highly active in human cells, as compared with rodent cells. The present data suggest that differences may exist between the AhR-mediated potencies of PAHs in human and rodent cells ... .",

PAHs usually occur naturally, but they can be manufactured as individual compounds for research purposes; however, not as the mixtures found in combustion products. ... Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar.

The aim of this study was to develop a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) gas chromatography (GC)-isotope dilution mass spectrometry method for the quantification of 10 four- to six-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urine samples. Seven of the selected PAHs have been classified as carcinogenic. Under the final conditions, analytes were sampled with a 100-um polydimethylsiloxane SPME fibre for 60 min at 80 \u00b0C and desorbed in the injection port of the GC at 270 \u00b0C. Fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene were separated using a highly arylene-modified phase capillary column and quantified by MS using eight deuterated PAHs as surrogate internal standards. Limits of quantification (LOQ) were in the 0.5- to 2.2-ng/L range. Validation showed linear dynamic ranges up to 340 ng/L, inter- and intra-run precisions <20%, and accuracies within 20% of spiked concentrations. Matrix effect evaluation and the use of control charts to monitor process performances showed that the isotope dilution approach allowed for the control of bias sources. Urinary PAHs were above or equal to LOQ, depending on different compounds, in 58-100% (min-max), 40-100% and 5-39% of samples from coke oven workers (n=12), asphalt workers (n=10) and individuals not occupationally exposed to PAHs (n=18), respectively. Chrysene was the most abundant PAH determined with median levels of 62.6, 6.9 and <0.6 ng/L, respectively. These results show that the method is suitable for quantifying carcinogenic PAHs in specimens from individuals with different levels of PAH exposure.",

A total of 104 coke oven workers (CW) from Poland [recruited in 2000 (CW-2000; n=55) and 2006 (CW-2006; n=49)], and 45 control subjects from the same area, provided urine spot samples for measurement of 10 PAHs (from phenanthrene to benzo[g,h,i]perylene). The comparison between the two methods was performed only on CW-2000 subjects. Information regarding personal characteristics and job variables was collected by a questionnaire. The new method enables the quantification of 5-, 6-ring PAHs; precision and accuracy were in the 7.3-20.8% and 89.4-110% range, respectively; in CW-2000 samples results obtained with the new and the old method were highly correlated (Lin's concordance correlation coefficients: from 0.790 to 0.965); the mean difference between measured PAHS increased with the molecular weight of the analytes (from +5 to +27%). Urinary PAHs were above or equal to the quantification limit, depending on the compound, in 67-100% (min-max), 26-100% and 6-100% of samples from CW-2000, CW-2006 and controls, respectively. Chrysene and benz[a]anthracene were the most abundant carcinogenic PAHs with median levels of 43.4, 13.4, and 2.3 ng/L and 45.9, 14.9, and 0.7 ng/L in CW-2000, CW-2006, and controls, respectively, while benzo[a]pyrene levels were 6.5, 0.7 and <0.5 ng/L. The multiple linear regression model showed that the determinants of exposure were the use of wood and/or coke for house heating for controls, and job title or the plant for CW-2006. Urinary benzo[a]pyrene and other carcinogenic PAHs were ... quantified in urine samples from both occupationally and environmentally exposed subjects. These results show that urinary PAHs can discriminate exposures at different levels. Moreover, the simultaneous determination of several PAHs allows for the development of excretion profiles to assess exposure to specific compounds.",

Four hydroxy metabolites of known and suspected carcinogenic PAHs (benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), benz[a]anthracene (B[a]A), and chrysene (CRY)) were selected as suitable biomarkers of PAH exposure and associated risks to human health. The analytical method included enzymatic deconjugation, liquid - liquid extraction, followed by derivatization with methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide and instrumental analysis. Photo-induced oxidation of target analytes - which has plagued previously published methods - was controlled by a combination of minimizing exposure to light, employing an antioxidant (2-mercaptoethanol) and utilizing a nitrogen atmosphere. Stability investigations also indicated that conjugated forms of the analytes are more stable than the non-conjugated forms. Accuracy and precision of the method were 77.4-101% (<4.9% RSD) in synthetic urine and 92.3-117% (<15% RSD) in human urine, respectively. Method detection limits, determined using eight replicates of low-level spiked human urine, ranged from 13 to 24 pg/mL. The method was successfully applied for analysis of a pooled human urine sample and 78 mouse urine samples collected from mice fed with PAH-contaminated diets. In mouse urine, greater than 94% of each analyte was present in its conjugated form.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. Benz(a)anthracene induced arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase in two human hepatoma cell lines. The percent of lymphoblasts was higher in benz(a)anthracene-treated cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells than in control cultures. ANIMAL STUDIES: 2 mg BA induced 17 carcinomas and 1 papilloma in the bladders of 52 mice surviving 40 or more weeks. The incidence of tumors in the controls was 3.8%. Single administration of 0.5 mg BA by stomach tube produced no tumors among 13 mice observed for 16 months. Eight or 16 administrations at three- to seven-day intervals produced a papilloma of the forestomach in 2/27 mice, whereas no tumors appeared among 16 controls. Benz(a)anthracene was mutagenic in an in vitro L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay with metabolic activation. Benz(a)anthracene showed unequivocal mutagenic activity with metabolic activation in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 as determined by Ames assay. Postnatal exposure to BA altered ovarian ERbeta expression, disturbed morphological development of the ovaries and caused ovarian dysfunction in immature rats. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: BA induced alterations in metabolic enzyme activity in northern bobwhite quail. An increase in mixed-function oxygenase and cytochrome p450 was found in intestinal homogenates from Nereis virens fed food contaminated with benz(a)anthracene. The lowest tested and observed effect concentration (LOEC) for Japanese medaka early life stages was equivalent to 0.92 ug/g dryw of BA. weight",

The present study was designed to determine whether such an IL-6 up-regulation also occurs in response to co-treatment by PAHs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, an inflammatory cytokine commonly found in tumor microenvironment. Co-exposure to the prototypical PAH benzanthracene (BZA) and TNF-alpha was found to markedly induce mRNA expression and secretion of IL-6 in human breast cancer cells MCF-7, whereas exposure to either BZA or TNF-alpha alone was without significant effect. Co-treatment by BZA and TNF-alpha-containing conditioned media from human inflammatory macrophages similarly up-regulated IL-6 expression in MCF-7 cells. BZA/TNF-alpha-mediated IL-6 induction in MCF-7 cells was counteracted by silencing aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), known to mediates most of PAH effects. IL-6 up-regulation was moreover associated with NF-kappaB activation and was abolished by using chemical NF-kappaB inhibitors or knocking-down expression of the p65/RelA NF-kappaB subunit. Taken together, these data indicate that co-exposure to BZA/TNF-alpha induces IL-6 expression by AhR- and NF-kappaB-dependent pathways in MCF-7 cancer cells. This regulation of IL-6 by environmental PAHs, that is dependent of inflammatory cytokine microenvironment, may contribute to the well-known carcinogenic properties of these organic pollutants.",

The hydroxylation of benzo(a)pyrene by human colon tumor cells is highly inducible. Phenobarbital plus hydrocortisone induce benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation activities 10-fold, while benz(a)anthracene induces the rate of hydroxylation 30-fold. Cytochrome P-450 specific content is increased 2- to 3-fold by treatment with phenobarbital plus hydrocortisone and benz(a)anthracene, respectively. Addition of cyclophosphamide alone results in no increase in hydroxylation activities but causes a decrease in cell growth rate. The combination of cyclophosphamide with either of the inducers phenobarbital plus hydrocortisone or benz(a)anthracene results in markedly enhanced inhibition of cell growth as judged both by a decrease in the number of cells per plate and in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. Thus, these data show that cyclophosphamide is cytotoxic to human colon tumor cells and that the cytotoxicity is enhanced by simultaneous administration of benz(a)anthracene or phenobarbital plus hydrocortisone to the tissue cultures.",

All of the PAH extracts were assayed in tester strains TA98 and TA100 both with and without metabolic activation using a liver fraction from Aroclor 1254-treated rats. None of the extracts from fungal incubations with the mutagenic PAHs, benzo[a]pyrene, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, 3-methylcholanthrene and benz[a]anthracene, as well as the non-mutagenic PAHs, naphthalene, phenanthrene and anthracene, displayed any appreciable mutagenic activity. In addition, time course experiments indicated that the rate of decrease in mutagenic activity in the extracts from cultures incubated with benzo[a]pyrene or 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene was coincident with the rate of increase in total metabolism. The results demonstrated the ability of the fungus C. elegans to detoxify known carcinogens and mutagens and suggests that this organism may play an important role in the metabolism and inactivation of PAHs in the environment.",

The participants had no special exposures and were chosen from among subjects in an ongoing study of reproductive health. All seven of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were found in all placentas, with the sole exception of benzo [a] pyrene in one placenta. Chrysene was present at the highest concentrations, with median 1.38 ng/g dry weight. Dibenz [a,h] anthracene and benzo [g,h,i] perylene had the lowest concentrations; each had median 0.73 ng/g dry weight. Concentrations in Kyiv were slightly higher than those in Dniprodzerzhinsk, but the difference was significant only for dibenz [a,h] anthracene. Dibenz [a,h] anthracene and benzo [g,h,i] perylene increased significantly with maternal body mass index, but other PAHs showed no such pattern. Placentas from deliveries in autumn or winter had slightly but not significantly higher concentrations. Concentrations were not related to maternal age. There were too few smokers in the sample for meaningful evaluation. No associations were seen between any of the placental PAH concentrations and birth weight of the infant.",

A total of 106 subjects were recruited from coke-oven workers (workers), residents in a metropolitan area (residents) and suburban gardeners (gardeners). All subjects were monitored twice for their personal exposures to PAHs. The biological samples were collected for measurements of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) and cotinine in urine. The geometric means of personal exposure levels of pyrene, benz(a)anthracene (BaA) and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) in workers were 1.470, 0.978 and 0.805 ug/cu m, respectively. The corresponding levels in residents were 0.050, 0.034 and 0.025 ug/cu m; and those in gardeners were 0.011, 0.020 and 0.008 ug/cu m, respectively. The conjugate of 1-OHP with glucuronide (1-OHP-G) is the predominant form of pyrene metabolite in urine and it showed strong associations with exposures not only to pyrene, but also to BaA, BaP and total PAHs. Most importantly, a significant difference in 1-OHP-G was even detected between the subgroups with exposures to BaP at < 0.010 and > 0.010 but < 0.020 ug/cu m, suggesting that 1-OHP-G is a good marker that can be used for the risk assessment of BaP exposure at levels currently encountered in ambient air. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses of 1-OHP-G on PAHs exposure indicated that cigarette smoke was a major confounding factor and should be considered and adjusted for while using 1-OHP to estimate PAHs exposure.",

Fifty-five Polish coke-oven workers were investigated by measurement of 12 hydroxylated metabolites of PAHs (OHPAHs) (1-, 2-hydroxynaphthalene; 2-, 9-hydroxyfluorene; 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 9-hydroxyphenanthrene; 1-hydroxyypyrene, 6-hydroxychrysene and 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene) and 13 unmetabolized PAHs (U-PAHs) (from naphthalene to benzo[a]pyrene), in spot urine samples collected at the end of the workshift. U-PAHs with four or less rings were detected in all samples. In particular, median levels for urinary naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, chrysene and benz[a]anthracene were 0.806, 0.721, 0.020, 0.032 and 0.035 ug/L. OHPAHs up to 1-hydroxypyrene were found in all samples, while high molecular-weight OHPAHs were always below quantification limit. Median level of 1-hydroxyypyrene was 15.4 ug/L. In all subjects significant correlations between OHPAHs and U-PAHs were observed (0.27 < r < 0.70, p < 0.01). Our results suggest that both hydroxylated metabolites and unmetabolized PAHs in urine are useful biomarkers of exposure to PAHs. Moreover, the simultaneous determination of several biomarkers permits to obtain specific excretion profiles that might help in exposure characterization and in better defining the excretion patterns.",

A total of 104 coke oven workers (CW) from Poland [recruited in 2000 (CW-2000; n=55) and 2006 (CW-2006; n=49)], and 45 control subjects from the same area, provided urine spot samples for measurement of 10 PAHs (from phenanthrene to benzo[g,h,i]perylene). The comparison between the two methods was performed only on CW-2000 subjects. Information regarding personal characteristics and job variables was collected by a questionnaire. The new method enables the quantification of 5-, 6-ring PAHs; precision and accuracy were in the 7.3-20.8% and 89.4-110% range, respectively; in CW-2000 samples results obtained with the new and the old method were highly correlated (Lin's concordance correlation coefficients: from 0.790 to 0.965); the mean difference between measured PAHS increased with the molecular weight of the analytes (from +5 to +27%). Urinary PAHs were above or equal to the quantification limit, depending on the compound, in 67-100% (min-max), 26-100% and 6-100% of samples from CW-2000, CW-2006 and controls, respectively. Chrysene and benz[a]anthracene were the most abundant carcinogenic PAHs with median levels of 43.4, 13.4, and 2.3 ng/L and 45.9, 14.9, and 0.7 ng/L in CW-2000, CW-2006, and controls, respectively, while benzo[a]pyrene levels were 6.5, 0.7 and <0.5 ng/L. The multiple linear regression model showed that the determinants of exposure were the use of wood and/or coke for house heating for controls, and job title or the plant for CW-2006. Urinary benzo[a]pyrene and other carcinogenic PAHs were ... quantified in urine samples from both occupationally and environmentally exposed subjects. These results show that urinary PAHs can discriminate exposure at different levels. Moreover, the simultaneous determination of several PAHs allows for the development of excretion profiles to assess exposure to specific compounds.",

In the present study, the effects of six well-known polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as benzo[a]pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[k]fluorancene and benzo[b]fluorancene, on the activities of hepatic and pulmonary cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes were investigated in male ICR mice. When mice were treated intraperitoneally with 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg of individual PAHs for 3 consecutive days, the activities of ethoxyresorufin- and methoxyresorufin-O-dealkylases were significantly and differentially induced in both liver and lung. Moreover, other CYP isozyme-associated monooxygenase activities were also induced significantly in liver and lung with characteristic induction profiles. /The/ results suggest that individual PAHs might have inductive effects on CYP isozymes, and that the characteristic inductive effects of individual PAHs on certain CYP isozymes would be developed as a marker for determining exposure to certain PAHs.",

Both chemicals at 10 mg/kg/day inhibited the gain in body weight, and consequent increase in relative liver weight. Hepatic gene expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 was significantly stimulated by administration of BaA (10 mg/kg/day) compared with the control. After administration of Cl-BaA, only the CYP1A2 gene was significantly induced, even at the lower dosage; CYP1A1 and 1B1 mRNA levels remained unchanged in Cl-BaA-treated rats compared with controls. ... /Chlorinated benz[a]anthracenes/",

The rate of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in hepatocytes was determined by measuring the extent of incorporation of labeled thymidine into DNA, using a scintillation counter; results were expressed per unit of DNA. The rate of UDS in treated cell cultures ranged from 0.78-1.14 times that of the negative control, indicating that the test compound was negative for UDS in human fibroblasts under the conditions of this assay. Positive control treatment with 4- nitroquinoline oxide (1X10E-5 M) produced the expected high increase in UDS (44.03 times that of solvent control).",

Acute toxicity of naphthalene, pyrene, and benz[a]anthracene (BAA) was examined in adult northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus). Additionally, subacute (8 d) and subchronic (60 d) studies were conducted to assess alterations in metabolic enzyme activity. Neither naphthalene, nor pyrene, nor BAA exposure via oral gavage produced acute toxicity up to the limit dose of 2 g/kg body weight. In the subacute study, quail provided feed containing the highest concentration of BAA for 5 d had significantly increased renal ethoxyresorufin O-deeththylase (EROD) activity compared to controls. Following a 3-d recovery period, significant increases between 10 and 100 mg/kg of BAA in feed existed for both hepatic EROD and pentoxyresorufin O-deethylase (PROD) activity compared to controls. Subchronic exposure to BAA (ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg) also resulted in a significant rise of EROD and PROD in both kidney and liver tissue compared to controls. Though the individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) used in this study were not acutely toxic, these results confirm that these individual PAHs induce alterations in metabolic enzyme activity in northern bobwhite quail.",

TCDD and 8 of the PAHs induced EROD activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Seven of these were previously shown to be acutely toxic to avian embryos, while the 10 congeners that did not produce an EROD response caused limited mortality. The rank order potency of the EROD-active congeners in all three species was as follows: TCDD > dibenz[ah]anthracene > benzo[k]fluoranthene > indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene > benzo[a]pyrene > chrysene ... /approximately equal to/ benz[a]anthracene ... /approximately equal to/ benz[ghi]perylene > benzo[b]naphtho[2,3-d]thiophene.

The short-term (24 hr) toxicity was assessed using chlorophyll a fluorescence transients, linked to photosynthetic parameters. The maximum quantum yield Fv/Fm was lower at the highest concentrations tested and the toxicity thresholds were species-dependent. For acute effects, fluoranthene was more toxic than benz(a)anthracene, with LOECs of 50.6 and 186 ug/L, respectively. After 72 hr exposure, there was a dose-dependent decrease in cell density, fluoranthene being more toxic than benz(a)anthracene. The population endpoint at 72 hr was affected to a greater extent than the photosynthetic endpoint at 24 hr. EC50 was evaluated using the Hill model, and species sensitivity was negatively correlated to cell biovolume. The largest species tested, the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, was almost insensitive to either PAH. The population endpoint EC50s for fluoranthene varied from 54 ug/L for the picophytoplankton Picochlorum sp. to 418 ug/L for the larger diatom Chaetoceros muelleri. ...",

The present study ... reports the toxicity of several alkylated derivatives of chrysene and benz[a]anthracene to the embryos of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) using the partition controlled delivery (PCD) method of exposure. The PCD method maintained the desired exposure concentrations by equilibrium partitioning of hydrophobic test compounds from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films. Test concentrations declined by only 13% over a period of 17 days. Based on the prevalence of signs of blue sac disease (BSD), as expressed by median effective concentrations (EC50s), benz[a]anthracene (B[a]A) was more toxic than chrysene. Alkylation generally increased toxicity, except at position 2 of B[a]A. Alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (alkyl-PAHs) substituted in the middle region had a lower EC50 than those substituted at the distal region. Except for B[a]A and 7-methylbenz[a]anthracene (7-MB), estimated EC50 values were higher than their solubility limits, which resulted in limited toxicity within the range of test concentrations. The regression between log EC50s and logKow values provided a rough estimation of structure-activity relationships for alkyl-PAHs, but Kow alone did not provide a complete explanation of the chronic toxicity of alkyl PAHs.",

Its release to the environment is wide spread since it is a ubiquitous product of incomplete combustion. It is released to the atmosphere in emissions from the combustion of oil, gasoline, coal, wood and refuse. If released into the atmosphere, a vapor pressure of 2.1X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benz(a)anthracene will exist both in the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor phase benz(a)anthracene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 8 hours. Benz(a)anthracene absorbs UV light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Particulate-phase benz(a)anthracene will be physically removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, benz(a)anthracene is expected to have no mobility based upon a Koc range of 545,000 to 1,870,000. Volatilization from moist soil is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.20X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption is expected to attenuate volatilization. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected given the vapor pressure of this compound. The degradation half-life for benz(a)anthracene in 2 soils was 261 days and 162 days, respectively, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, benz(a)anthracene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc range. Benz(a)anthracene had half-lives ranging from 199-252 days in three seawater-sediment slurries, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 39 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond was estimated as 12 years when adsorption was considered. An estimated BCF of 2,940 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to benz(a)anthracene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is generated. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benz(a)anthracene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and smoking tobacco products. (SRC)",

The use of such products may result in the release of benz(a)anthracene to the environment via the atmosphere and various waste streams(SRC).",

Volatilization of benz(a)anthracene from moist soil surfaces is expected(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.20X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4); however, volatilization will be attenuated by adsorption to soil(SRC).

Benz(a)anthracene may volatilize from water surfaces(SRC) based on a Henry's Law constant of 1.20X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(3). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4) volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 days and 39 days, respectively(SRC); however, volatilization will be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond was estimated as 12 years when adsorption was considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 2,940(SRC), from its log Kow of 5.76(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Benz(a)anthracene had half-lives ranging from 199-252 days in three seawater-sediment slurries(9), suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Therefore, high initial concentrations are rapidly reduced (few hours). However low concentrations caused by desorption can last almost indefinitely(1). The dissolved benz(a)anthracene will undergo photolysis (half-life hours to a few days) and in eutrophic bodies of water, oxidation by alkylperoxy radicals may be important. The relative contribution of sorption and photolysis to benz(a)anthracene removal will depend on the type of aquatic system(4). In a microcosm experiment which simulated shallow coastal waters of the northeast US, 29 percent of the benz(a)anthracene had respired to CO2 while 21 percent was unchanged(2). When a crude oil dispersion was placed on top of a water column in a controlled ecosystem enclosure in Saanich Inlet, Canada, the benz(a)anthracene concentration in the water column decreased exponentially, declining to half its initial concentration in 4 to 5 days(3). Another study determined a half-life for benz(a)anthracene of 290 days in sediment from an oil-contaminated stream but a half-life of 10 to 400 times as long in an uncontaminated stream(5). Benz(a)anthracene was found to absorb light beyond 480 nm and photolyze in sunlight(6). The photolysis half-life of benz(a)anthracene in water measured in early March at 40 N latitude was determined to be 5 hours(6). Another investigator estimated that the midsummer photolysis half-life for benz(a)anthracene was 0.6 hours(4). The photolysis rate for benz(a)anthracene was reduced in humic waters due to light screening and quenching. Photolysis was also inhibited in anaerobic waters. In addition, 7,12-benzanthracene quinone and 2 unidentified products were observed in aerobic waters(6). When modeled for various environmental systems, the photolysis half-life of benz(a)anthracene was 10 hours for an oligotrophic lake, 20 hours for a stream and 50 hours for a eutrophic pond or lake(1). Although the rate of loss due to oxidation by peroxyl radicals is about four times slower than for photolysis, this process is dominant in a eutrophic lake or pond (half-life of 38 hours)(6). In an experiment in which crude oil was added to a large salt-water tank with simulated natural conditions, 55 percent of the benz(a)anthracene photo-decomposed in 5 hours and 100 percent photo-decomposed in 10 hours(7).",

Vapor-phase benz(a)anthracene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 8 hours(SRC)calculated from its rate constant of 5X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase benz(a)anthracene may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Benz(a)anthracene irradiated with light at wavelengths greater than 290 nm was found to be 25.3 percent degraded after 17 hours(4). Benz(a)anthracene is found in the atmosphere both as the free vapor and adsorbed to particulate matter. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons are found concentrated in submicron particles and aerosols. These particles will be transported but are subject to gravitational settling and scavenging by rain and snow. The estimated half-lives of these particles in the atmosphere has been estimated to be 5 to 30 days during which time they can be transported to remote regions(5,6).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Several researchers have studied the degradation in sediment which has been contaminated with petroleum products. In one such study, 1.4-1.8% degradation of benz(a)anthracene was observed per week in a seawater-sediment slurry which indicates a half-life of 199-252 days(4,5). Another study determined a half-life for benz(a)anthracene of 290 days in sediment from an oil-contaminated stream but a half-life of 10 to 400 times as long in an uncontaminated stream(8). Microbial degradation of benz(a)anthracene is faster in the upper layers of sediment(4). Another investigator reported a much faster half-life for benz(a)anthracene, 9 days in stream sediment near the outfall of a coal-coking operation but no degradation in the stream water(6). Another study reported no degradation of benz(a)anthracene in an estuarine stream(7). In some situations, degradation of benz(a)anthracene was limited by lack of nutrients in the water(9,10).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 8 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Benz(a)anthracene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Benz(a)anthracene irradiated with light at wavelengths greater than 290 nm was found to be 25.3 percent degraded after 17 hours(3). The rate of decomposition of benz(a)anthracene adsorbed on the surface of kaolin particulates after irradiation to sunlight and UV light was determined to be 0.142/hour yielding 7,12-benzanthraquinone(4). Degradation products of benz(a)anthracene irradiated for 6 hours using a mercury lamp at wavelengths > 290 include p-quinones, dialdehydes, hydroxy derivatives, and coumarines/xanthones(5). Exposure of benz(a)anthracene to nitrogen dioxide and ozone at varying levels for 6 hours showed degradation of benz(a)anthracene ranging from 0 to 47 percent(6).

The photolysis half-life of benz(a)anthracene in water measured in early March at 40 N latitude was determined to be 5 hours(1). Another investigator estimated that the midsummer photolysis half-life for benz(a)anthracene in sunlit surface waters to be 0.6 hour(2). The photolysis rate for benz(a)anthracene was reduced in humic waters due to light screening and quenching. Photolysis was also inhibited in anaerobic waters. In addition, 7,12-benzanthracene quinone and 2 unidentified products were observed in aerobic waters(1). When modeled for various environmental systems, the photolysis half-life of benz(a)anthracene was 10 hr for an oligotrophic lake, 20 hrs for a stream and 50 hr for a eutrophic pond or lake(3). Although the rate of loss due to oxidation by peroxyl radicals is about four times slower than for photolysis; this process is dominant in a eutrophic lake or pond (half-life of 38 hr)(1). In an experiment in which crude oil was added to a large salt-water tank with simulated natural conditions, 55% of the benz(a)anthracene photo-decomposed in 5 hours and 100% photo-decomposed in 10 hours(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a recommended classification scheme(2), these experimental Koc values suggest that benz(a)anthracene is expected to be immobile in soil(SRC). In a modeling study, 55, 71 and 88 percent of the benz(a)anthracene was predicted to be sorbed in a lake, stream, and eutrophic pond respectively(1). 39 percent of the benz(a)anthracene added to the water column of a controlled ecosystem was recovered in the sediment a week later(3). Benz(a)anthracene, which adsorbed to sediments in a microcosm, was mostly (40 to 60 percent) found in surface sections collected 4 to 5 cm below the surface(4). Sandy soil from a former wood impregnation plant and heterogeneous soil from a former tar-oil refinery were found to adsorb 105.8 and 95.7 mg/kg soil benz(a)anthracene, respectively(5). In estuarine water, 53 percent benz(a)anthracene adsorbed on particles after 3 hours. After 3 hours incubation in natural seawater, 59 percent of 3 ug/L was taken up by suspended aggregates of dead phytoplankton cells and bacteria(6).",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 3 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 39 days(SRC). Benz(a)anthracene 's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). In a laboratory experiment using a beaker, the volatilization half-life of benz(a)anthracene in a rapidly-stirred aqueous solution was determined to be 89 hours(3). However, adsorption is expected to attenuate the rate of volatilization from water and moist soils(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond was estimated as 12 years when adsorption was considered(4). Benz(a)anthracene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based on a vapor pressure of 2.1X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C Hg(5).",

Suspended particulate matter samples were collected in exhaust rooms of the tunnel running under the Patapsco River in Baltimore, MD from 1985 to 1986. Benz(a)anthracene in the tunnel had a lower average concentration ranging from 1.9 to 29 ng/cu-m as opposed to the average benz(a)anthracene concentration in 1975 of 102 ng/cu-m(2). The open burning of rubber tires yielded 82 mg/kg chunk tire and 102 mg/kg shred tire of benz(a)anthracene in the tire emissions(3). The concentration of benz(a)anthracene in an effluent channel from a coking plant was determined to be 15 ug/g dry weight in sediment and 2.0 ug/L in water(4). Analysis of several diesel engine emissions revealed an average benz(a)anthracene concentration of 33.0 ug/hr(5). The concentration of benz(a)anthracene in four fuels was determined to average 0.72 mg/L; the concentration of benz(a)anthracene from particulate emission and gaseous emission from a fuel-injected Otto engine was determined to average 2.77 ug/km and 1.81 ug/km, respectively(6). Mean benz(a)anthracene emissions from the top of coke ovens from 4 plants located in China ranged from 0.09 to 11.39 ug/cu m(7).",

Benz(a)anthracene was identified in brake lining particles and road dust particles at concentrations of 1.5 and 1.2 ug/g of particle sample, respectively(2). Aerosol samples were collected systematically throughout a complete annual cycle (1982) at four urban sites in southern California. Ambient annual concentrations of benz(a)anthracene ranged from 0.09 to 0.29 ng/cu m(3). Fine particle emission rates for benz(a)anthracene from a natural gas-fired water heater and a natural gas-fired space heater were determined. A HEPA-filtered dilution air sample emission rate for benz(a)anthracene was not detected; the emission rate for benz(a)anthracene through the first filter was determined to be 497.7 pg/kJ; the emission rate for benz(a)anthracene through the backup filter was 6.7 pg/kJ(4).",

METHODS: Using headspace gas chromatography, 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission concentrations were quantified over eight temperatures (120-315 \u00b0C) for paving asphalt (n = 20) and Types II, III, and IV BURA (n = 5) and were summarized by geometric means (GMs) and geometric standard deviations (GSDs) at each temperature. The relationships between temperature and concentration were evaluated for PAH analytes using mixed-effects regression models. Temperature was categorized into regimes: Regime 1 (120-150 \u00b0C) representing temperatures typical of paving asphalt application, Regime 2 (180-230 \u00b0C) representing temperatures typical of BURA application, and Regime 3 (260-315 \u00b0C) which were high temperatures outside typical application temperatures. An interaction term was used to evaluate differential effects of temperature on paving asphalt versus BURA. RESULTS: In the paving regime (120-150 \u00b0C), paving asphalt emission concentrations were highest for 2- and 3-ring PAHs [GM (GSD) at 150 \u00b0C of 4.51 (2.07), 3.77 (1.63), 2.26 (1.53), and 1.80 (1.66) ug/cu m for 2-methyl naphthalene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and acenaphthene, respectively], with all the 4- and 5- to 6-ring individual PAHs mean concentrations below the detection limit, with the exception of benz[a]anthracene. In the BURA regime (180-230 \u00b0C), BURA emission concentrations were highest for 2- and 3-ring PAHs [GM (GSD) at 205 \u00b0C of 121.3 (1.37), 99.5 (1.31), 69.5 (1.32), and 68.1 (1.37) ug/cu m for acenaphthene, anthracene, 2-methyl naphthalene, and phenanthrene, respectively], with lower but detectable concentrations for 4- and 5- to 6-ring PAHs. For both paving asphalt and BURA, concentrations increased log linearly with temperature. At a given temperature, the highest concentrations were observed for 2-ring PAHs with lower and decreasing concentrations observed with increased ring size. Temperature was a statistically significant (P < 0.01) predictor of concentration for each analyte. Furthermore, the categorical temperature regime variable explained a large percent of the variability in concentrations accounting for 74-92% of the total variability in PAH concentration. In both paving asphalt and BURA, the relationship between temperature and concentration was non-linear. There was a statistically significant difference between paving asphalt and BURA in the temperature-concentration relationship for the each analyte. Temperature alone did not account for differences in paving asphalt and BURA concentrations in 5- to 6-ring PAHs. CONCLUSIONS: Emission concentrations are driven by temperature for both paving asphalt and BURA samples under studied experimental conditions. There are differences in paving asphalt and BURA emission concentrations that are not explained by temperature alone; concentrations were higher and consisted of larger ring (4 and 5 to 6) PAHs for BURA as compared to paving asphalt at the respective application temperature ranges.",

Benz(a)anthracene particulate levels in the atmosphere ranged from 0.10 to 1.0 ug/cu m in the anode plant, 0.08 to 0.18 ug/cu m in the aluminum plant, and 0.06 to 6.3 ug/cu m at the pin plant(1). Glass capillary gas chromatography showed that workers in coke plant were exposed to 5 to 1000 mg polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)/cu m air (including fluoranthene). Fluoranthene was present at approximately 30% of the total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Particulate matter contains 98% respirable PAH(2). The percent benz(a)anthracene of the total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons identified in various work atmospheres was determined to be approximately 2.5 in a ferro-alloy plant, 7 in an aluminum plant, 9 in an iron works plant, 12 in a coke plant, and <0.1 in a foundry(3). The level of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from smoking kilns in Danish smokehouses was determined. The maximum benz(a)anthracene concentration observed in 10 smokehouses was determined to be 92 ug/cu m(4). Benz(a)anthracene was detected in 8 out of 13 Swedish homes that used wood heating appliances at levels of <LOQ to 2.5 ng/cu m, and it was detected in 2 homes that did not use wood heating appliances atlevels <LOQ to 0.55 ng/cu m(5).",

A total of 106 subjects were recruited from coke-oven workers (workers), residents in a metropolitan area (residents) and suburban gardeners (gardeners). All subjects were monitored twice for their personal exposures to PAHs. The biological samples were collected for measurements of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) and cotinine in urine. The geometric means of personal exposure levels of pyrene, benz(a)anthracene (BaA) and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) in workers were 1.470, 0.978 and 0.805 ug/cu m, respectively. The corresponding levels in residents were 0.050, 0.034 and 0.025 ug/cu m; and those in gardeners were 0.011, 0.020 and 0.008 ug/cu m, respectively. The conjugate of 1-OHP with glucuronide (1-OHP-G) is the predominant form of pyrene metabolite in urine and it showed strong associations with exposures not only to pyrene, but also to BaA, BaP and total PAHs. Most importantly, a significant difference in 1-OHP-G was even detected between the subgroups with exposures to BaP at < 0.010 and > 0.010 but < 0.020 ug/cu m, suggesting that 1-OHP-G is a good marker that can be used for the risk assessment of BaP exposure at levels currently encountered in ambient air. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses of 1-OHP-G on PAHs exposure indicated that cigarette smoke was a major confounding factor and should be considered and adjusted for while using 1-OHP to estimate PAHs exposure.",

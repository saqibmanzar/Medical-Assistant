When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Crystallographic analysis of the interaction between bisphenols and ERs reveals two discrete binding modes, reflecting the different activities of compounds on ERs. BPA and 17beta-estradiol bind to ERs in a similar fashion, whereas, with a phenol ring pointing toward the activation helix H12, the orientation of BPC accounts for the marked antagonist character of this compound. Based on structural data, /the investigators/ developed a protocol for in silico evaluation of the interaction between bisphenols and ERs or other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, such as estrogen-related receptor gamma and androgen receptor, which are two known main targets of bisphenols. ...",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.4X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bisphenol C will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase bisphenol C will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.3 hours. Particulate-phase bisphenol C will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, bisphenol C is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.0X10+5. The estimated pKa of bisphenol C is 9.9, indicating that this compound will exist partially in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Bisphenol C is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process in soil and water based on results of river die-away tests in which bisphenol C showed complete degradation in 18 of 24 microcosms within 22 days. If released into water, bisphenol C is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 620 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Sensitized photo-oxidation may have some importance as a fate process for bisphenol C in sunlit natural water. Occupational exposure to bisphenol C may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bisphenol C is produced or used. Use data suggest the general population may be exposed to bisphenol C via dermal contact with this compound from consumer products containing polymers made from bisphenol C. (SRC)",

Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Lower doses showed a slight tendency to lower epoxide  hydrolase activity. Glutathione S-transferase activity in cytosol was decreased significantly  by 2.08 mmol/kg ziram; more effective were 4.16 mmol/kg levels. Microsomal glutathione  S-transferase activity was diminished significantly by 4.16 mmol/kg ziram, while doses below  exerted a lesser and insignificant effect. In vitro concns of 1-8 umol/ml ziram caused a  steady and significant decr of epoxide hydrolase and glutathione S-transferase activities.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7.5X10-9 mm Hg at 0 \u00b0C, indicates ziram will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase ziram will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, ziram is expected to have slight to moderate mobility in soil based on Rf values ranging from 0.33 to 0.62. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.2X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Under acidic conditions, dimethyldithiocarbamates readily decompose to form carbon disulfide and dimethylamine. Biodegradation in soil environments may occur as the compound ionizes to form dimethyldithiocarbamate ions that biodegrade in soil; a %CO2 evolution of 68-79 after 49 days has been reported. Ziram possesses antibacterial properties, particularly for gram positive organisms, which would hinder biodegradation under many situations. If released into water, ziram is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon Rf values ranging from 0.33 to 0.62, retardation factors derived using soil column studies. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected based upon the estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF range of 5-90 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Ziram undergoes hydrolysis in the environment with half-lives in water of 2 to 18 days. Occupational exposure to ziram may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ziram is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of ziram from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.2X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 7.5X10-9 mm Hg(3), and water solubility, 65 mg/l(4). Ziram is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(3). Under acidic conditions, dimethyldithiocarbamates readily decompose to form carbon disulfide and dimethylamine(2). Biodegradation in soil environments may occur as the compound ionizes to form dimethyldithiocarbamate ions that biodegrade in soil(2); a %CO2 evolution of 68-79 after 49 days has been reported(1). However, ziram possesses antibacterial properties, particularly for gram positive organisms, which would hinder biodegradation under many situations(5).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.2X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 7.5X10-9 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 65 mg/l(5). This compound is expected to exist in the dissociated form in the environment and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF range of 5-90(1), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate(SRC). Ziram undergos hydrolysis in the environment with hydrolysis half-lives in water of 2 to 18 days(1). Under acidic conditions, dimethyldithiocarbamates readily decompose to form carbon disulfide and dimethylamine(2). Biodegradation in aquatic environments may occur as the compound ionizes to form dimethyldithiocarbamate ions that biodegrade in soil(2); a %CO2 evolution of 68-79 after 49 days has been reported(1). However, ziram possesses antibacterial properties, particularly for gram positive organisms, which would hinder biodegradation under many situations(7).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Concns of dithiocarbamate fungicides in the workroom air of a pesticide residue laboratory were below the provisional threshold level value of 5 mg/cu m(2). Concn ranges in the field were 15 to 2,300 ng/cu m after application of ziram to an almond orchard in Butte Co., CA, applied at 6.7 kg/ha. Three days after application, measurable residues in air samples (minimum detection limit approx 14 ng/cu m) were detected within 18 m of the treated fields(4).",

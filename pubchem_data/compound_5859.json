For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Famphur (O,O-dimethyl O-(p-(dimethylsulfamoyl)phenyl) phosph is found on List D. Case No: 4039; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): Famphur (O,O-dimethyl O-(p-(dimethylsulfamoyl)phenyl) phosph; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

Hydrolysis under basic conditions will occur at a more rapid rate, with a calculated half-life value of 60 days at pH 10. Famphur may adsorb to sediment and suspended organic matter, but it is not expected to bioconcentrate in fish and aquatic organisms. If released to soil, slow hydrolysis may occur in this media.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

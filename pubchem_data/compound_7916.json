When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 45 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isopropenyl acetate is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase isopropenyl acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone and photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; estimated half-lives for these reactions are 24 and 7.5 hours, respectively. If released to soil, isopropenyl acetate is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 120. Volatilization from wet soil surfaces is expected to occur based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. This compound's vapor pressure indicates that volatilization from dry soil surfaces may potentially occur. If released into water, adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column is not expected given the estimated Koc for this compound. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 4.1 days, respectively. The potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low based upon the estimated BCF of 5.5. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process based upon estimated half-lives of 300 and 30 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to isopropenyl acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isopropenyl acetate is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

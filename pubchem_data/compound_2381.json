ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The efficacy of choice antidotal treatment consisting of acetylcholinesterase reactivator obidoxime and one of four anticholinergic drugs (atropine, benactyzine, biperiden, scopolamine) was compared.  Testing of tabun-induced neurotoxicity progress was carried out using the method Functional observational battery. The experimental animals as well as controls were observed at 24 hours and 7 days following tabun or saline administration.  The results were compared to the condition of animals without anticholinergic drug (oxime alone) and control rats that received physiological solution instead of tabun and treatment. Antidotal treatment involving centrally acting anticholinergic drugs (benactyzine, biperiden, scopolamine) showed significantly higher neuroprotective efficacy compared to antidotal treatment containing atropine.",

The neurotoxicity of soman was evaluated using a Functional observational battery and an automatic measurement of motor activity.  Pharmacological pretreatment as well as antidotal treatment were able to eliminate some of soman-induced neurotoxic effects observed at 24 hours following soman poisoning. The combination of pharmacological pretreatment (PANPAL or pyridostigmine combined with biperiden) and antidotal treatment was found to be more effective in the elimination of soman-induced neurotoxicity in rats at 24 hours following soman challenge in comparison with the administration of pharmacological pretreatment or antidotal treatment alone. To compare both pharmacological pretreatments, the combination of pyridostigmine with biperiden seems to be more efficacious to eliminate soman-induced signs of neurotoxicity than PANPAL. At 7 days following soman poisoning, the combination of pharmacological pretreatment involving pyridostigmine and biperiden with antidotal treatment was only able to completely eliminate soman-induced neurotoxic signs. Thus, our findings confirm that the combination of pharmacological pretreatment and antidotal treatment is able not only to protect the experimental animals from the lethal effects of soman, but also to eliminate most soman-induced signs of neurotoxicity in poisoned rats. The pharmacological pretreatment containing pyridostigmine and biperiden appears to be more efficacious to eliminate soman-induced neurotoxic sings than PANPAL.",

Caution should be observed in patients with manifest glaucoma, though no prohibitive rise in intraocular pressure has been noted following either oral or parenteral administration. Patients with prostatism, epilepsy or cardiac arrhythmia should be given this drug with caution. Occasionally, drowsiness may occur, and patients who drive a car or operate any other potentially dangerous machinery should be warned of this possibility.

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The subcellular distribution of BP or TP used clinically conformed with that of QNB, a typical potent central muscarinic antagonist. The concentration-time courses of the brain subcellular fractions for these drugs were of two types which decreased slowly and in parallel to the plasma concentration. The subcellular distribution in the brain and heart was dependent on the protein amount of each fraction. The percent post-nuclear fraction (P2) of the total concentration in the lung was characteristically about 3-5 times larger than that in the heart. It was elucidated that the distribution in the lung differs from that in the brain and heart, with high affinity which is not dependent on the protein amount in the P2 fraction containing lysosomes. On the other hand, at a low dose (650 ng/kg) of 3H-QNB, each fraction as a percentage of the total concentration in the brain increased in synaptic membrane and synaptic vesicles and decreased in nuclei and cytosol as compared with the high dose. These results show that although the tissue concentration-time courses of anticholinergic drugs appear to decrease simply in parallel to plasma concentration, the subcellular distribution exhibits a variety of patterns among various tissues.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

If Biperiden was administered orally, gastric lavage or other measures to limit absorption should be instituted. A small dose of diazepam or a short acting barbiturate may be administered if CNS excitation is observed. Phenothiazines are contraindicated because the toxicity may be intensified due to their antimuscarinic action, causing coma. Respiratory support, artificial respiration or vasopressor agents may be necessary. Hyperpyrexia must be reversed, fluid volume replaced and acid-base balance maintained. Urinary catheterization may be necessary. Routine use of physostigmine for overdose is controversial. Delirium, hallucinations, coma, and supraventricular tachycardia (not ventricular tachycardias or conduction defects) seem to respond. If indicated, 1 mg (half this amount for the children or elderly) may be given intramuscularly or by slow intravenous infusion. If there is no response within 20 minutes, and additional 1 mg dose may be given; this may be repeated until a total of 4 mg has been administered, a reversal of the toxic effects occur or excessive cholinergic signs are seen. Frequent monitoring of clinical signs should be done. Since physostigmine is rapidly destroyed, additional injections may be required every one or two hours to maintain control. The relapse intervals tend to lengthen as the toxic anticholinergic agent is metabolized, so the patient should be carefully observed for 8 to 12 hours following the last relapse. (L1712)",

Drug concentrations in various tissues were determined after intravenous administration of [3(H)]QNB or [3(H)]NMS (325 ng kg(-1)). Biperiden (6.4 mg kg(-1)) was administered either 5 min before, concomitantly with or 20 min after injection of [3(H)]QNB or [3(H)]NMS. When biperiden was administered concomitantly with or before [3(H)]QNB, distribution of [3(H)]QNB among the regions of the brain and other tissues was reduced; at 4 hr the ratio of the distribution of [3(H)]QNB for experimental animals to that for control animals ranged from 0.15 to 0.9. When biperiden was administered after [3(H)]QNB, the distribution of [3H]QNB in the brain and other tissues was significantly higher than for the other two treatments (P < 0.01). However, for [3(H)]NMS the sequence of administration had no effect on the distribution of the drug in the brain and other tissues except for the kidney. In-vitro, in crude synaptosomal membranes, the amount of [3(H)]QNB at 2 hr relative to the control concentration at equilibrium was 87% when biperiden was added before [3(H)]QNB and 56% when biperiden was added after [3(H)]QNB. In both instances the concentration of [3(H)]NMS reached equilibrium within 30 min. These findings suggest that the difference between the rate constant of association and dissociation at the possible site of action gives rise to the effect of the sequence of administration on the pharmacokinetic interaction.",

After 14 days of administration with 2 mg/kg haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic drug, and 2 mg/kg biperiden, a high-affinity antagonist for muscarinic receptors in the brain, approximately 500 mRNAs related to synaptic function were investigated. The levels of the mRNAs related to the ubiquitin-related systems were significantly reduced after the combined administration. However, the separate administration of either haloperidol or biperiden had little effect on the levels of the mRNAs. This result suggests that coadministration of haloperidol and biperiden specifically affects the ubiquitin-related system.",

Neuropsychiatric signs such as delirium, disorientation, anxiety, hallucinations, illusions, confusion, incoherence, agitation, hyperactivity, ataxia, loss of memory, paranoia, combativeness, and seizures may be present.

However, ACM is not without adverse effects and, in the elderly, cognitive and memory impairments have been emphasized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of discontinuation of ACM on cognitive functions in a group of elderly chronic schizophrenia patients. Twenty-seven elderly patients (age 60 years or older), who were diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia (DSM-IV) and receiving ACM in addition to antipsychotic treatment, were enrolled. Before and after ACM was discontinued, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) subscale was administered. Twenty-one patients completed the study. All were receiving Akineton (biperiden), 2-6 mg daily before the study. Significant improvement in the ADAS-Cog total score was demonstrated (P < 0.03), as well as in the ideational praxia and orientation subscales. Improvement was correlated with the previous dose of biperidin. No adverse events or emergent extrapyramidal symptoms were noted. Discontinuation of ACM may be warranted in chronic schizophrenia patients since it may improve cognitive functioning with no adverse effects.",

EEG data were investigated quantitatively by power spectrum analyses using fast Fourier transformation. Ten male Wistar rats receiving saline (i.p.) were used as the control group.  Treated rats demonstrated two types of alternating behavioral change: a hyperactive and hypoactive state. In the hyperactive state, rapid walking, excessive random sniffing, and retropulsion were observed, with EEG desynchronization (significantly increased alpha1 (8.0-10.0 Hz), alpha2 (10.0-13.0 Hz), and beta (13.0-30.0 Hz) power values), as well as EEG slowing (significantly increased delta (0.5-4.0 Hz) and theta1 (4.0-6.0 Hz) power values): significantly marked rapid eye movement, and increased EMG activity.

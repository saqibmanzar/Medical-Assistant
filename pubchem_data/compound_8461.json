PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Bioactivation of 2,4-DNT is thought to occur by the following processes: The methyl group is oxidized to an alcohol by a cytochrome P-450 dependent pathway; the benzyl alcohol is conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the bile. Intestinal microflora hydrolyzes the glucuronide and reduces one nitro group, forming an aminonitrobenzyl alcohol which can be readsorbed from the intestine. The amino group is oxidized to an hydroxylamine by hepatic enzymes and conjugated with sulfate, by sulfotransferase. Decomposition of the sulfate ester yields a highly electrophilic nitrenium (or carbonium) ion which can react with DNA and other biological nucleophiles. The major metabolite found in human urine is 2,4-dinitrobenzyl alcohol or its glucuronide conjugate. Other urinary metabolites include 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, 4-(N-acetyl)amino-2nitrobenzoic acid, and 2-amino-4-nitrobenzoic acid. The latter two are clearly the product of both oxidative and reductive metabolism. Metabolism is also believed to involve O-acetyltransferase (which transfers the acetyl group of 2,4-DNT) and cytosolic xanthine oxidase (which reduces 2,4-DNT). Small traces of unmetabolized 2,4-DNT can be observed in the urine too. (L276, A169, T47, A170, A177, A178)",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

After nitration, if separation of the resulting emulsion is difficult, the introduction of pure product can give ... rapid separation.",

Known amounts of granular FS300, FS400, powdered FS300, and regenerated spent FS300 and FS400 activated carbon were equilibrated with aqueous 2,4-dinitrotoluene solutions. The aqueous phase was analyzed by HPLC or UV spectrophotometry. The solid phases were dried, weighed, and desorbed with water, acetone, a 1:1 acetone/water mixture, and methanol. The solvent extracts were analyzed by UV spectrophotometry, HPLC, and GC/MS. The equilibrium adsorptive capacities of 2,4-dinitrotoluene on the activated carbons were assessed by constructing Freundlich adsorption isotherms. Both types of activated-carbon effectively adsorbed 2,4-dinitrotoluene from the solutions. The adsorptive capacities ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 grams 2,4-dinitrotoluene per gram carbon. Acetone and methanol were better solvents than water for desorbing 2,4-dinitrotoluene. More 2,4-dinitrotoluene could be recovered from spent FS400 than from spent FS300. 2,4-Dinitrotoluene derivatives such as 2,4-dinitrobenzyl alcohol, 2,4-dinitrobenzaldehyde, 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, and methyl-2,4-dinitrobenzoate were identified in the extracts. The authors conclude that 2,4-dinitrotoluene contaminated carbons can be regenerated by extracting them with methanol, acetone, or their mixtures with water. Some of the adsorbed 2,4-dinitrotoluene is converted to its derivatives, probably as a result of side chain oxidation.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The sulfate conjugate is degraded into carbonium or nitrenium ions. These ions covalently bind to hepatic macromolecules (DNA, RNA), leading to mutations and subsequently liver tumors. They also bind to DNA of the lung and the intestine. (L276, T45, A171, L280)",

Male F-344 rats were administered one of the sulfotransferase inhibitors (40 umol/kg ip) 45 min prior to oral administration of 28 mg/kg ring-(14)C-2,4-DNT or 3-(3)H-2,6-DNT and killed 12 hr later. Pentachlorophenol had no significant effect on the urinary excretion of the benzyl glucuronide or benzoic acid metabolites of 2,6-DNT. The sulfotransferase inhibitors decreased the total hepatic macromolecular covalent binding of 2,4-DNT by 33%, and of 2,6-DNT by 69%. Hepatic DNA showed covalent binding of 2,4- and 2,6-DNT of 45 and 94 pmol equivalents/mg DNA, respectively. The sulfotransferase inhibitors decreased the binding of the hepatocarcinogen 2,6-DNT to hepatic DNA by greater than 95%. 2,6-Dichloro-4-nitrophenol decreased the binding of 2,4-DNT to DNA by >84% while the decrease due to pentachlorophenol was 33%. These results suggest that sulfation is important in the biotransformation of 2,4- and 2,4-DNT to reactive metabolites which covalently bind to DNA. 3H20 was detected in the urine of rats administered 3-(3)H-2,6-DNT.",

Examination of blood, liver, and cardiovascular system should be stressed. b) A complete blood count: Dinitrotoluene has been shown to cause methemoglobinemia. Those with blood disorders may be at increased risk. A complete blood count should be performed, including a red cell count, a white cell count, a differential count of a stained smear, as well as hemoglobin and hematocrit. Observe for Heinz bodies. c) Liver function tests: Since liver damage has been observed in humans exposed to dinitrotoluene, a profile of liver function should be obtained by using a medically acceptable array of biochemical tests. Periodic Medical Examination: The aforementioned medical examination should be repeated on an annual basis. Methemoglobin determinations should be performed at any time overexposure is suspected or signs and symptoms of toxicity occur. The level of dinitrotoluene in the urine should be determined; excretion of dinitrotoluene in excess of 25 mg/L indicates significant absorption. /Dinitrotoluene/",

One-half of the group developed clinical signs of intoxication, chiefly pallor, cyanosis, and a low grade anemia. ... No instances of permanent physical impairment were found.",

The mixture and the individual isomers of DNT were found to be mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella microsome test, particularly in strains responding to frame-shift mutagens; 3,5-DNT was the most effective isomer in inducing reversion to histidine prototrophy in Salmonella typhimurium strain s TA98 and TA1538. Similar results were obtained with a quantitative reversion assay using strain TA98; 3,5-DNT was the most mutagenic of the compounds examined, particularly in the absence of post-mitochondrial supernants of rat-liver homogenates. While all isomers and the mixture of DNT increased the 8-azaguanine resistant fraction of Salmonella typhimurium TM677 to some degree, the greater mutagenicity of 3,5-DNT compared to other isomers was not evident in the forward mutation assay.",

Neither 2,6-DNT nor 2,4-dinitrotoluene is carcinogenic in the strain A mouse lung bioassay. The ip administration of 2,6-DNT or 2,4-dinitrotoluene (150 mg/kg each) to Fischer-344 rats resulted, after 24 hr, in covalent binding to DNA of the liver (131.1 to 259.9 pmol 2,6-DNT/mg DNA; 215.4 to 226.8 pmol 2,4-dinitrotoluene/mg DNA), and lower binding to DNA of the lung and the intestine (14.9 to 22.7 pmol 2,6-DNT/mg DNA; 45.0 to 75.0 pmol 2,6-DNT/mg DNA). Similar treatment of A/J mice resulted in lower binding in the liver (25.9 to 31.9 pmol 2,6-DNT/mg DNA; 42.6 to 58.9 pmol 2,4-dinitrotoluene/mg DNA), no detectable binding of 2,6-DNT in extrahepatic tissues and low amounts of binding of 2,4-dinitrotoluene to lung and intestinal DNA (9.7 to 39.0 pmol/mg DNA). Covalent binding of the noncarcinogenic isomeric 2,4-dinitrotoluene to DNA of various tissues of both species suggests that factors other than binding to DNA determine the ultimate carcinogenic effect of these cmpd.",

Gene expression profile results correlated well with clinical data and liver histopathology that lead to the concept that hematotoxicity was followed by hepatotoxicity. Overall, 2,4DNT, 2,6DNT and TNT had stronger effects than 2ADNT and 4ADNT. Common functional terms, gene expression patterns, pathways and networks were regulated across all nitrotoluenes. These pathways included NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function, xenobiotic metabolism signaling and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. One biological process common to all compounds, lipid metabolism, was found to be impacted both at the transcriptional and lipid production level.",

Dietary inclusion of 2,4-DNT at 700 ppm (0.7%) was associated with an average 2,4-DNT uptake of 34 mg/kg/day in males and 45 mg/kg/day in females, and with clinical toxicity including decreased weight gain and increased mortality (100% by Month 23). Death was attributed primarily to pituitary tumors, ulcerated subcutaneous tumors, and inanition. Behavior disturbances and motor dysfunction relative to dose were pathognostic and often attributable to pituitary dysfunction, including hyperexcitability, one-sided ataxia, and/or paralysis of the hindquarters or entire body. Histopathological assessment also revealed hepatocellular carcinoma and increased incidence of common background tumors in this strain of rat, with fibromas in the males and mammary fibroadenomas in the females. Pituitary chromophobe adenomas in both males and females were significantly decreased. An apparent hemolytic anemia, as evidenced by increased reticulocyte counts, also accompanied treatment, although evidence of methemoglobin, Heintz bodies, and lesions of the erythropoietic system was inconsistent. In males, 2,4-DNT also induced atrophy of seminiferous tubules with near complete lack of spermatogenesis in some cases. Mid-level animals (average intake 3.9 mg/kg/day males and 5.1 mg/kg/day females) exhibited similar if milder responses in susceptible individuals, while rats of a low level exposure were apparently free of toxic effects.",

High-dose mice exhibited treatment-related toxicity beginning at Week 28, including low bodyweight, red-orange urine stains, hypoactivity, hunchback, hyperexcitability with stimuli, abnormal gait and muscular dysfunction, and nearly halved survival relative to the other treatment groups. Dietary inclusion of 2,4-DNT from 100 ppm was associated with consistently reduced bodyweights from Month 12, nephropathy, pigmentation (2,4-DNT metabolites or hemolytic deposits), liver dysplasia (mostly in males), increased intestinal pinworms, and unique renal tumors (males only). Treatment-related lesions were more extensive and numerous in mid-dose mice and included cystic renal tumors (over 50% in males), aspermatogenesis and testicular atrophy. High-dose females had nonfunctioning ovaries. Toxic anemia and appearance of Heinz bodies (signifying hemolytic activity) was noted primarily in moribund mid-dose males and high-dose males and females, nearly unanimous among high-dose animals. One-month recovery following 12 and 24-month dietary exposure indicated some amelioration of effects upon the blood. Furthermore, a lesser incidence of toxic anemia or methemoglobin among survivors of 24-month exposure suggested an adaptive or compensatory mechanism. Study authors offered that the lesser incidence of renal tumors in high-dose relative to the mid-dose mice probably reflected early deaths among the susceptible population. There was, however, greater incidence and severity of hepatocellular dysplasia and nephropathy in these animals.",

Repeated oral administration of 1.4 mg/kg (mid-level) 2,4-DNT and above was associated with effects on the erythrocytes, the biliary tract, the nervous system, and mortality. Increasing reticulocyte levels, Heinz bodies or methemoglobin (high-dose dogs only) were noted in mid- and high-dose animals after 12 months of treatment. All high-dose dogs (after Weeks 8-20, total dose 510-1,240 mg/kg) and 1 mid-level dosed dog (after Week 66, total dose 700 mg/kg) also exhibited neurological effects, documented as ataxia and/or incoordination and paralysis involving hindlimbs, trunk, neck, and control of lips and tongue. High-dose dogs continued to express neurologic symptoms up to the third quarter of treatment (18 months, total dose 2,730 mg/kg). All other mid-level dosed dogs remained free of overt toxicity throughout study (25 months, cumulative dose up to 1,092 mg/kg). Loss of bodyweight coincided with inability to eat or drink during those episodes causing oral motor dysfunction. Three high-dose dogs, euthanized due to severe paralysis, were found to have generalized endothelial vacuolization, hypertrophy and mitosis, and degenerative lesions of the cerebellum and brain stem. Encephalopathy was not identified in other dogs exhibiting neurotoxic signs, and the study authors concluded that biochemical lesions rather than microscopically visible histopathological lesions might be significant at lesser levels of toxicity. Administration of a barbiturate overdose for euthanasia relaxed the paralysis in all cases. Upon terminal necropsy, hyperplasia of both biliary tract and the gallbladder epithelium was found unresolved in affected male and female pairs of middle and high dose dogs sacrificed and necropsied at Months 13 and 25 after a 1-month cessation of treatment at 12 and 24 months, respectively. No other treatment-related lesions were identified and no effects on relative or absolute organ weights were noted at any treatment level at either assessment (12 or 24 months). Red blood cell effects noted early in treatment were only minimally apparent after 24 months in both mid- and high-dose dogs. Study authors suggested that a tolerance or compensatory ability after prolonged exposures may explain the diminution of treatment-associated effects on erythrocytes.",

After 3, 9, or 20 months each group was fed single oral doses of 57 mg/kg (males) or 65 mg/kg (females) 2,4-DNT, spiked with 25 uCi/kg of DNT-(ring-UL-14C, specific activity 3.55 mCi/mM) and suspended in peanut oil, by oral gavage in a volume of 10 ml/kg bodyweight. Urine and feces were collected for 24 hours, after which all animals were sacrificed for collection of blood from the abdominal aorta and analysis of tissues for radioactivity. The sample was nearly wholly absorbed, a large portion returned in the urine after 24 hours with minor amounts appearing in the gastrointestinal tract and feces. Only a trace amount of radioactivity remained in the tissues, largely in the liver and kidney. The predominant metabolites were dinitro-, aminonitro-, and diaminobenzyl alcohols indicating oxidation of the side chain and reduction of nitro groups; very little unmetabolized 2,4-DNT was recovered. Conjugation products of these metabolites primarily constituted the total excreta. Because of morbidity and mortality among high-dose rats at the 20 months' scheduled gavage, extra mid-dose animals were used for the final analysis. No significant discrepancies in absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion values were noted between exposure groups, sexes, or terms of exposure.",

The LD50 was determined to be 55 mg/kg using corn oil as a vehicle. Individuals dosed exceeding this level were moribund or died within 60 hr of exposure. Morbidity and death occurred during the 14-day range-finding study at dosing regimens of 35 and 55, but not at 15, 5, and 0.5 mg/kg/day. Compound-related morbidity/mortality occurred in the 60-day study during the first week of exposure at 25 and 15, but not at 5, 1, and 0 mg/kg/day. Overt signs of toxicity occurred with both sexes at the onset of exposure. Signs included weight loss, diarrhea, and lethargy. Dose-related changes in egg production, ovary, kidney, and brain mass, and body weight, but not feed consumption, were found. Changes in kidney mass and histological observations suggest accumulation of nitrogenous waste may be the cause of morbidity. These data suggest that oral 2,4-DNT exposures are more acutely toxic and has a different etiology than 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene in birds.",

Adult fish were exposed to four concentrations of 2,4- DNT (11, 22, 44, 88 uM respectively) for 10 days. RNA extracted from the liver of exposed fish and from unexposed control fish were converted into cDNA, labeled using Cy3 and Cy5 and hybridized to the cDNA microarrays. Statistical analysis of hybridization signals was used to identify 72 cDNAs that are affected by exposure to different concentrations of 2,4-DNT. Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed that several apolipoprotein subunit genes as well as a fatty acid binding protein were down-regulated in the livers of exposed fish suggesting that 2,4-DNT interferes with lipid metabolism. ...Results also indicate that 2,4-DNT interferes with oxygen transport in the blood as suggested by its effect on the expression of the hemoglobin alpha chain gene, two transferrin genes as well as genes coding for mitochondrial respiratory chain components. These observations correlate well with the results of a 2,4-DNT toxicity study which indicated that high doses of 2,4-DNT cause methemoglobinemia and anemia in exposed animals as well as an almost total absence of body fat. Our study on 2,4-DNT toxicity using a fathead minnow microarray platform suggests that cDNA microarrays can be useful to identify the mechanisms of toxicity and as a predictive tool for toxicity in mammals.",

The joint toxic effects derived from AI values show that the mixture toxicity of 2,4-DNT and the other nitrobenzenes is synergistic (AI>0), whilst the mixture toxicity of 2,4-DNT and the anilines is antagonistic (AI<0). These results confirm that the mixture toxicity is mainly related to intracellular oxidation and reduction. -E(LUMO) values of nitrobenzenes are higher. The nitrobenzenes when mixed with 2,4-DNT make the mixture systems easily reduced; the mixture toxicity effect is synergism. On the other hand, -E(LUMO) values of anilines are lower. The anilines when mixed with 2,4-DNT can make the mixture systems less easily reduced, and the mixture toxicity effect is antagonism.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.47X10-4 mm Hg at 22 \u00b0C indicates 2,4-dinitrotoluene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. However, at 15 \u00b0C, 2,4-dinitrotoluene has a vapor pressure of 6X10-5 mm Hg which indicates it will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. 2,4-Dinitrotoluene has been detected in atmospheric particulate matter. Vapor-phase 2,4-dinitrotoluene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 75 days. Particulate-phase 2,4-dinitrotoluene may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition. 2,4-Dinitrotoluene is susceptible to direct photolysis in sunlight. If released to soil, 2,4-dinitrotoluene may have high to low mobility based upon an experimentally determined Koc range of 57-2000 in various soils. Leaching of 2,4-dinitrotoluene has been observed in soil column transport studies and the compound has been detected in groundwater samples beneath ammunition plants indicating 2,4-dinitrotoluene can leach from soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a measured Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C. 2,4-Dinitrotoluene may undergo direct photolysis on soil surfaces based on observed photolysis of 2,4-dinitrotoluene in water. Biodegradation of 2,4-dinitrotoluene is expected to be an important fate process in soil and water based on results of various screening tests that demonstrated microbial degradation. If released into water, 2,4-dinitrotoluene is expected to be susceptible to adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the Koc range. Volatilization from water surfaces is not an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Photolysis of 1.0 ppm 2,4-dinitrotoluene in distilled and natural waters gave half-lives of 43 hrs in distilled water and 2.7, 9.6, and 3.7 hrs in river, bay and pond waters, respectively. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 2,4-dinitrotoluene may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4-dinitrotoluene is produced or used. The main group to be at high risk for exposure to 2,4-dinitrotoluene is industrial workers involved in the manufacture or handling of 2,4-dinitrotoluene in places such as ammunition, dye, and polyurethane plants.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 9(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.98(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Photolysis of 1.0 ppm 2,4-dinitrotoluene in distilled and natural waters gave half-lives of 43 hrs in distilled water and 2.7, 9.6, and 3.7 hrs in river, bay and pond waters, respectively(9). 2,4-Dinitrotoluene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(4). Biodegradation of 2,4-dinitrotoluene is expected to be an important fate process in water based on results of various screening tests that demonstrated microbial degradation(10-14).",

However, at 15 \u00b0C, 2,4-dinitrotoluene has a vapor pressure of 6X10-5 mm Hg(3) which indicates it will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. 2,4-Dinitrotoluene has been detected in atmospheric particulate matter(4). Vapor-phase 2,4-dinitrotoluene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 75 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.2X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined using a structure estimation method(5). Particulate-phase 2,4-dinitrotoluene may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). 2,4-Dinitrotoluene is susceptible to direct photolysis in sunlight(6).",

On the other hand, natural surface water microorganisms could use 10 ppm 2,4-dinitrotoluene as a sole carbon source(2). After a 2-3 day lag period, > 90% of 10 ppm 2,4-dinitrotoluene was transformed in aerated water after 6 days of incubation. This same culture was acclimated to grow on 120 ppm 2,4-dinitrotoluene(2). 2,4-Dinitrotoluene degraded rapidly in 2 days in a batch culture containing glucose and inoculated with an industrial seed(3). The industrial seed contained four bacterial genera (Actinobacter, Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium and Pseudomonas) and one yeast (Rhodotorula). Municipal seed (conventional activated sludge organisms), however, were inhibited by 2,4-dinitrotoluene concentrations as low as 10 mg/L(3). 2,4-Dinitrotoluene biodegradability was studied in a static screening test in which each flask contained 2,4-dinitrotoluene at either 5 or 10 mg/L, 5 mg/L yeast extract and settled domestic sewage as the inoculum. Percent biodegradation after 7 days in the original culture and the first, second and third subculture were 77, 61, 50 and 27%, respectively, at 5 mg/L initial concentration; 50, 49, 44 and 23% biodegradation, respectively, was observed at 10 mg/L initial concentration(4). The percent of 2,4-dinitrotoluene biodegraded decreased with each subculture.",

In an anaerobic cyclone fermentor study, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (at 10 mg/L initial concentration) had half-lives of 78.3 and 1.7 days under metabolism and co-metabolism conditions respectively(3). In anaerobic tests using wastewater from a munitions production facility, initial 2,4-dinitrotoluene degraded by 40% in non-sterile conditions and by 28% in sterile conditions over a 36-day incubation period(4).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 75 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 2,4-Dinitrotoluene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(2). 2,4-Dinitrotoluene concentration did not change after 2 weeks incubation in sterile, natural water(3). In aqueous solution, 2,4-dinitrotoluene has a quantum yield of 0.000656 at 313 nm(4) indicating that it is susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Photolysis of 1.0 ppm 2,4-dinitrotoluene in distilled and natural waters gave half-lives of 43 hrs in distilled water and 2.7, 9.6, and 3.7 hrs in river, bay and pond waters, respectively(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In three Chinese soils (organic carbon content of 0.47, 1.0 and 2.2%), measured Freundlich coefficients (Kf) for 2,4-dinitrotoluene ranged from 0.66 to 5.1 mmol-L/kg(2) that correspond to a Koc range of approximately 200 to 1000(SRC).

Springer Nature aims to provide only highly qualitative and relevant content but references of lower relevance aren't withheld as they might contain also very useful information.",

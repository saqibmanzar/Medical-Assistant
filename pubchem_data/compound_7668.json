ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, dermal contact), exposure to this colorless liquid may occur from its use in textile dyeing and printing, as a solvent for cellulose acetate, and in the manufacture of methylstyrene. Effects from exposure may include burns to the skin and eyes, nausea, headache, dizziness, central nervous system depression, and unconsciousness.  In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus and protective clothing. If contact should occur, immediately irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water.  Contaminated clothing should be removed and left at the site.  This substance is flammable and may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames. Its heavier-than-air vapor may travel to a source of ignition and flash back, or accumulate to explosive concentrations in enclosed spaces, such as sewers.  Also, containers of n-propylbenzene may explode in the heat of a fire.  For fires involving this substance, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or alcohol-resistant foam. Isolate for 1/2 mile in all directions if tank, rail car or tank truck is involved in the fire. For small spills of n-propylbenzene, take up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent, and place into container for later disposal. Dike far ahead of large spills to contain for later disposal.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The effect was expressed as the toxicant concn in water required to reduce feeding rate by 50% (WEC50). A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) was derived in which WEC50 was negatively correlated with log 10 octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow) and positively correlated with aqueous solubility, indicating that hydrophobicity has a major influence on toxicity. Quantitative structure-activity relationships calculated among bioconcentration factor, log Kow, and aqueous solubility showed that hydrophobicity influences toxicity largely through its effect on bioconcentration. This observation was confirmed by expressing toxicity as the toxicant concn in mussel tissue required to reduce feeding rate by 50% (TEC50). For the compounds tested which have log Kow values < 4.6, TEC50 was relatively constant, irrespective of molecular structure. Compounds with log Kow values > 5 could be accumulated to much greater concn before feeding rate was affected, indicating that there is a molecular wt cut-off in the toxicological response. The log Kow for n-propylbenzene was 3.69, the mean bioconcentration factor was 38.0, the WEC50 was 0.86 mg/l (0.69-1.07 mg/l) and the TEC50 was 27.0 mg/kg",

Treatment of male rat with the small aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, m-xylene, and p-xylene increased several P450-dependent activities, with ethylbenzene, m-xylene, and n-propylbenzene producing the greatest response. Hydrocarbon treatment differentially affected toluene metabolism, producing a response dependent on the metabolite monitored. In untreated rats, benzyl alcohol was the major hydroxylation product of toluene metabolism, comprising > 99% of the total metabolites formed. Hydrocarbon treatment increased the overall rate of toluene metabolism by dramatically increasing the amount of aromatic hydroxylation. Ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene and m-xylene were the most effective inducers of aromatic hydroxylation of toluene. In contrast, production of the major toluene metabolite benzyl alcohol was increased only after treatment with m-xylene. 2. P450 2B1/2B2 levels were induced by each of the hydrocarbons examined, with the magnitude of induction increasing with increasing hydrocarbon size. P450 1A1 was also induced after hydrocarbon exposure; however, the degree of induction was smaller than that observed for P450 2B1/2B2. P450 2C11 levels were suppressed after treatment with benzene, ethylbenzene and n-propylbenzene. 3. Taken together these results display two induction patterns. The first generally corresponds to changes in the P450 2B subfamily, where activities (e.g. the aromatic hydroxylations of toluene) were most effectively induced by ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene and m-xylene. In the second, induction was observed only after m-xylene treatment, a pattern that was found when the metabolism of the substrate was catalysed by both the P450 2B subfamily and P450 2C11. Hydrocarbons that both induced P450 2B1/2B2 and suppressed P450 2C11 (such as ethylbenzene and n-propylbenzene) showed little change in activities catalysed by both isozymes (e.g. aliphatic hydroxylation of toluene, and aniline hydroxylation); however, m-xylene treatment led to elevated P450 2B1/2B2 levels without significantly suppressing P450 2C11. m-Xylene produced significant increases in activities efficiently catalysed by both isozymes. Therefore, the unique induction pattern observed after m-xylene treatment can be accounted for by induction of P450 2B1/2B2 without concomitant suppression of P450 2C11.",

It's production and use as a solvent and in textile dyeing and printing may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.42 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-propylbenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-propylbenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. If released to soil, n-propylbenzene is expected to have low mobility based upon Koc values of 676 and 725 and an estimated value of 955. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.05X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. n-Propylbenzene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation in soil may occur based upon results of activated sludge studies, theoretical BODs ranging from 21.8 to 43.7%. If released into water, n-propylbenzene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the Koc. Biodegradation from water may occur based on activated sludge studies. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hr and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 138 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to n-propylbenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-propylbenzene is produced or used. The general population is continually exposed to n-propylbenzene through inhalation since it has been frequently detected in the atmosphere. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(5) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.05X01-2 atm-cu m/mole(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(5), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hr and 4 days, respectively(SRC). Volatilization half-lives of 1.3 to 19 days have been predicted for the Narraganset Bay near RI where volatilization is expected to be the major removal process(10). Aquatic hydrolysis is not an important fate process(SRC) due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(5). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 138(SRC), from its log Kow of 3.69(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Biodegradation from water may occur based on activated sludge studies, with theoretical BODs ranging from 21.8 to 43.7%(11,12).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that n-propylbenzene is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 1 hour(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4 days(SRC). Results of mesocosm studies simulating the Narragansett Bay indicate that volatilization is the major removal process from seawater(3); volatilization half-lives of 1.3-19 days were estimated for summer, spring and winter seasons(5). n-Propylbenzene's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of n-propylbenzene from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon it's vapor pressure of 3.42 mm Hg(4).",

Air samples collected inside a tire re-treading factory in Italy contained n-propylbenzene levels of 0-15 ug/cu m(2); a shoe sole factory (vulcanization area) had a level of 30-300 ug/cu m(2).

The general population is continually exposed to n-propylbenzene through inhalation since it has been detected frequently in the atmosphere(SRC).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The total daily amt of phenobarbital then is administered as a single dose or in 3 or 4 divided doses, not to exceed 600 mg/day. If signs of withdrawal occur on the first day of treatment, a loading dose of 100 to 200 mg of phenobarbital may be administered intramuscularly in addition to the oral dose. After stabilization on phenobarbital, the total daily dose is decreased by 30 mg/day as long as withdrawal is proceeding smoothly. This regimen may be modified by initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage level and decreasing the daily dosage by 10% if tolerated by the patient. 3) For infants physically dependent on barbiturates, initially a dose of 3 to 10 mg of phenobarbital/kg bw/day may be given. After withdrawal symptoms (hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, tremors, hyperreflexia) are relieved, the dosage of phenobarbital should be gradually decreased and completely withdrawn over a 2-wk period. 4) Also, barbiturate withdrawal may be accomplished with benzodiazepines, such as diazepam. /Barbiturates/",

To eliminate the induction of hepatic metabolism by systemic administration of pentobarbital, an i.c.v. infusion model of tolerance to and withdrawal from pentobarbital was used. Little is known about the functional modulation of the G protein alpha-subunits at the molecular level. The effects of continuous infusion of pentobarbital on the modulation of G protein alpha-subunits mRNA were investigated by using in situ hybridization study. In situ hybridization showed that the level of G alpha s mRNA was increased in the septum and brainstem, and the level of G alpha o mRNA was elevated in the cortex during the pentobarbital withdrawal. The level of G alpha i mRNA was significantly elevated in almost all area of brain during the pentobarbital withdrawal. These results suggest that region-specific changes of G protein alpha-subunit mRNA were involved in the withdrawal from pentobarbital, whereas alpha-subunit is not so highly involved in the pentobarbital tolerance.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The net result of barbiturate action is acute potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic tone.

Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly. Standard treatment for shock should be administered if necessary. Management of hypotension may include administration of iv fluids, elevation of the lower extremities, and/or use of vasopressor or inotropic agents. For seizures, iv diazepam and phenytoin may be used; in case of refractory seizures, general anesthesia and paralysis induced by a neuromuscular blocking agent may be necessary. Activated charcoal is an effective barbiturate adsorbant when administered within 30 minutes following ingestion of the drugs. ... Gastric aspiration is not recommended unless there is evidence that the drug has been ingested recently (within 4 hours); care should be taken to prevent pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Multiple-dose, nasogastric administration of activated charcoal has been used effectively to treat phenobarbital overdose; activated charcoal enhances elimination of the drug and shortens the duration of coma. The patient's vital signs, fluid intake, blood gases, and serum electrolytes should be monitored closely. Analeptic drugs should not be administered because they may produce paroxysmal cerebral activity which may result in generalized seizures. In addition, it has been demonstrated that analeptics are incapable of stimulating respiration and exerting an arousal effect in patients with severe barbiturate poisoning and profound CNS depression. If renal function is normal, forced diuresis may be of benefit. In addition, alkalinization of the urine increases renal excretion of phenobarbital, aprobarbital, and mephobarbital which is metabolized to phenobarbital. Peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis may be useful in severe barbiturate intoxication and/or if the patient is anuric or in shock. /Barbiturates General Statement/",

The subjects were tested during alert state and under sedation following intravenous administration of pentobarbital. The injection of pentobarbital not only significantly reduced the response signal strength but the reduction in BOLD contrast signal was related to the ratio of amount of sedative administered and the subject's body weight. The three subjects with the highest relative sedative dosage even displayed an inverted (negative) BOLD contrast signal. A significant reduction in the number of positively correlating pixels was found 15 min after administration of pentobarbital. All measured parameters returned to near pre-sedative levels by the end of the experimental session. The relative dosage dependence of the strength of the BOLD signal the negative BOLD signal in the three subjects with the highest relative sedative dosage indicates that pentobarbital had a more pronounced effect on cerebral blood flow than on cerebral oxidative metabolism.",

During wakefulness, /investigators/ measured the genioglossus reflex response to negative-pressure pulses. During sleep, carbon dioxide was insufflated into the inspired air. Airway pressure was then decreased in a stepwise fashion until arousal from sleep.With basal breathing during sleep, flow-rate was lower in volunteers given pentobarbital, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration and upper airway resistance were greater, and Pcrit was unaffected (pentobarbital: -11.7+/-4.5 vs. placebo: -10.25+/-3.6 cm H2O, p=0.11). Pentobarbital increased the time to arousal (297+/-63s vs. 232+/-67s p<0.05), at which time phasic genioglossus EMG was higher (6.2+/-4.8 %max vs. 3.1+/-3%, respectively, p<0.05) as were carbon dioxide levels. The increase in genioglossus electromyogram after carbon dioxide administration was greater after pentobarbital vs. placebo. Pentobarbital did not affect the genioglossus negative pressure reflex.Pentobarbital increases the time to arousal and stimulates genioglossus muscle activity, but it increases upper airway resistance during sleep.",

Pentobarbital enhances the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid and suppresses the activities of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathways. In this study, /investigators/ used pentobarbital to study the effects on the glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure in conscious rats. Rhabdomyolysis was induced by intramuscular injection of 10 mL/kg of 50% glycerol in conscious rats. Ten minutes later, the rats received an intravenous injection of pentobarbital (10 mg/kg in 0.5 mL/hr normal saline) or normal saline (0.5 mL/hr). Biochemical substances, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cre), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were measured at 0 hour, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours. Rats were killed by decapitation at 48 hours after glycerol administration, and the kidneys were removed immediately for pathological findings and immunohistochemistry. Intramuscular injection of glycerol significantly increased blood BUN, Cre, GOT, GPT, CPK levels and induced severe histopathologic damage in the kidneys. NF-kappaB and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were increased, and E-cadherin was decreased after glycerol administration, as detected by immunohistochemistry in the kidneys. Posttreatment with pentobarbital decreased blood BUN, Cre, GOT, GPT, CPK levels, decreased the markers of kidney injury, and suppressed the release of NF-kappaB and iNOS after rhabdomyolysis. Posttreatment with pentobarbital suppressed the activities of NF-kappaB and iNOS, decreased BUN, Cre, GOT, GPT, CPK levels, and decreased the markers of kidney injury after rhabdomyolysis. These actions ameliorated rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal failure in conscious rats.",

The basic approach was to examine changes in compound action potential (CAP) in a rat sural nerve induced by sodium pentobarbital. Rats were either sacrificed by cervical dislocation (control) or anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.), and a 30 mm long sural nerve segment excised and placed on electrodes in a thermostatically controlled recording chamber. CAPs were evoked by electrically stimulating the sural nerve segment with supra-threshold stimuli. CAP in control sural nerves consisted of the early component (A axons: 32.73 +/- 2.91 m/s) and the late component (C axons: 0.92 +/- 0.05 m/s) with peak voltage amplitudes 4.9 +/- 1.0 mV and 0.1 +/- 0.03 mV, respectively. Anaesthesia with sodium pentobarbital had no effect on CAP latency. However, the amplitude of CAP of both A and C axons was reduced by approximately 40% and 50%, respectively. The depressant effect of pentobarbital on CAPs was statistically significant for both groups of axons (p<0.01). Non-selective sensitivity of A and C axons to pentobarbital suggests even distribution of receptors for GABA in these two populations of axons in the rat peripheral nerve.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.0X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pentobarbital will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase pentobarbital will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Pentobarbital does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pentobarbital is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 28. The pKa of pentobarbital is 7.8, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.4X10-13 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, pentobarbital is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to pentobarbital may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pentobarbital is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to pentobarbital via ingestion of drinking water. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to pentobarbital via ingestion of medications containing pentobarbital. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

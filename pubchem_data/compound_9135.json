PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

We previously demonstrated that both bay region and fjord region terminal rings are involved in the in vitro metabolism of BcC. In the present investigation, we prepared [14-(3)H]BcC and tested the hypothesis that BcC can be activated to both bay region and fjord region diol epoxides in female CD rats. At 6 weeks of age, rats were gavaged with a single dose of [14-(3)H]BcC (5 mg/rat; specific activity, 6.7 Ci/mmol) in 0.5 mL of trioctanoin. During the first 48 h, 20.3% of the dose was eliminated in the feces and 2.8% was eliminated in the urine. After 1 week, cumulatively, 23.2 and 3.5%, respectively, were eliminated. 3-Hydroxybenzo[c]chrysene, 10-hydroxybenzo[c]chrysene, and trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[c]chrysene were the major fecal metabolites. In urine, trans-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrobenzo[c]chrysene, 2-hydroxybenzo[c]chrysene, (+/-)-1,t-2,t-3,c-4-tetrahydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[c]chrysene, and (+/-)-9,t-10,t-11,c-12-tetrahydroxy-9,10,11,12-tetrahydrobenzo[c]chrysene were detected, primarily as glucuronic acid and sulfate conjugates. The identification of the two tetraols clearly indicates that both bay region and fjord region diol epoxides are formed as intermediates in the metabolism of BcC in vivo. The second goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the location of the epoxide moiety (fjord vs bay region) determines the carcinogenic activity. Thus, we compared the carcinogenicity of the bay region (+/-)-anti-1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-epoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[c]chrysene and the fjord region (+/-)-anti-9,10-dihydroxy-11,12-epoxy-9,10,11,12-tetrahydrobenzo[c]chrysene in the rat mammary gland. The results clearly showed that the fjord region diol epoxide is a potent mammary carcinogen, while the bay region diol epoxide lacks activity in this model assay. ...",

Since the fjord region dihydrodiol epoxides were hydrolytically unstable under the experimental conditions, their enzymatic formation was determined by analyzing the tetraols as their products of acidic hydrolysis upon addition of perchloric acid. The various stereoisomeric tetraols formed were separated by HPLC and identified by co-chromatography with authentic tetraols, which had been prepared by acidic hydrolysis of synthetically available syn- and anti-dihydrodiol epoxides and characterized by NMR and UV spectroscopy. Under standardized conditions the acidic hydrolysis of syn-dihydrodiol epoxides of benzo[c]chrysene, benzo[g]chrysene and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene resulted in the formation of two tetraols with cis/trans ratios of 81:19, 77:23 and 80:20, respectively, whereas the anti-dihydrodiol epoxides underwent almost exclusively trans hydrolysis. The proportion of the stereoisomeric tetraols obtained from microsomal incubations indicates that all three dihydrodiols are predominantly oxidized at the adjacent olefinic double bond to the anti-diastereomers of the corresponding fjord region dihydrodiol epoxides accounting for 4-35% of the ethyl acetate-extractable metabolites. To allow quantitative assessment of the metabolites (3)H-labeled trans-dihydrodiols were synthesized by reduction of the corresponding o-quinones with sodium borotritide. Metabolic conversion of benzo[c]chrysene-trans-9,10- and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene-trans-11,12-dihydrodiol by rat liver microsomes were in a similar low range during the first 10 min of incubation (6.2 +/- 1.2 and 3.4 +/- 1.0 nmol substrate/nmol cytochrome P450/10 min, respectively), whereas the conversion of benzo[g]chrysene-trans-11,12-dihydrodiol was much higher (20.6 +/- 2.2 nmol substrate/nmol cytochrome P450/10 min). Given the strong intrinsic mutagenic and carcinogenic activity of the fjord region dihydrodiol epoxides, our data indicate that their formation, even at a relatively low level, may contribute significantly to the biological activity of the parent hydrocarbons.",

In the present study, individual stereoisomers of the bay-region diol epoxides of chrysene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyrene as well as of the fjord-region diol epoxides of benzo[c]phenanthrene, benzo[c]chrysene, and benzo[g]-chrysene have been incubated with GSH in the presence of human glutathione transferases GSTM1-1 (a mu-class enzyme) and GSTP1-1 (a pi-class enzyme). As previously shown with GSTA1-1 (an alpha-class enzyme) both M1-1 and P1-1 demonstrate considerable activity toward a number of the diol epoxides studied, although a great variation in catalytic efficiency and enantioselectivity was observed. With GSTM1-1, the bay-region diol epoxides, in particular the syn-diastereomers were in most cases more efficiently conjugated with GSH than the fjord-region analogues. GSTM1-1 demonstrated an enantioselectivity ranging from no preference (50%) to high preference (> or = 90%) for conjugation of the enantiomers with R-configuration at the benzylic position of the oxirane ring. With GSTP1-1, the enzyme demonstrated appreciable activity toward both bay- and fjord-region diol epoxides and, in most cases, a preference for the anti-diastereomers. In contrast to GSTM1-1 and as previously shown for GSTA1-1, GSTP1-1 showed an exclusive preference for conjugation of the enantiomers with R-configuration at the benzylic oxirane carbon. With both GSTM1-1 and GSTP1-1, the chemically most reactive diol epoxide, the (+)-syn-enantiomer of trans-7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,-10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPDE), was the best substrate. As for GSTA1-1, no obvious correlation between chemical reactivity or lipophilicity of the compounds and catalytic efficiencies was observed. Molecular modeling of diol epoxides in the active sites of GSTP1-1 and -A1-1 is in agreement with the assumption, based on functional studies, that the H-site of GSTA1-1  can accommodate stereoisomers of different sizes. Further, modeling of the enantiomers of anti- and syn-BPDE in the active site of GSTP1-1 provides an explanation for the exclusive preference for the enantiomers with R-configuration at the benzylic oxirane carbon. These isomers could be snuggly fitted in the H-site close to the GSH sulfur, whereas those with opposite stereochemistry could not.",

The Pi class human glutathione (GSH) transferase (hGSTP1-1), which is polymorphic in humans with respect to amino acid residues in positions 104 (isoleucine or valine) and/or 113 (alanine or valine), plays an important role in the detoxification of PAH-diol epoxides. Here, we report that the location of the epoxide function determines specificity of allelic variants of hGSTP1-1 toward racemic anti-diol epoxide isomers of benzo[c]chrysene (B[c]C). The catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of V104,A113 (VA) and V104,V113 (VV) variants of hGSTP1-1 was approximately 2.3- and 1.7-fold higher, respectively, than that of the I104,A113 (IA) isoform toward bay region isomer (+/-)-anti-B[c]C-1,2-diol-3,4-epoxide. On the other hand, the IA variant was approximately 1.6- and 3.5-fold more efficient than VA and VV isoforms, respectively, in catalyzing the GSH conjugation of fjord region isomer (+/-)-anti-B[c]C-9,10-diol-11,12-epoxide. The results of the present study clearly indicate that the location of the epoxide function determines specificity of the allelic variants of hGSTP1-1 in the GSH conjugation of activated diol epoxide isomers of B[c]C.",

In the present study, individual stereoisomers of the bay region diol epoxides of chrysene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene, as well as of the fjord region diol epoxides of benzo[c]phenanthrene, benzo[c]chrysene and benzo[g]chrysene, have been incubated with glutathione (GSH) in the presence or absence of human glutathione S-transferase isoenzyme GST A1-1, a class Alpha enzyme. The formation of GSH conjugates was determined and quantified by HPLC. The results demonstrate that the GST A1-1 isoenzyme catalyzes the formation of GSH conjugates of all diol epoxides tested, although a marked variation in catalytic efficiency (>20-fold) was observed. With both bay and fjord region anti-diol epoxides a significant preference for conjugation of the enantiomer with the R configuration at the benzylic position of the oxirane ring was noted. Among the syn diastereomers of the fjord region diol epoxides a similar substrate enantioselectivity was noted, i.e. the enantiomer with the corresponding R configuration was again preferentially conjugated. In contrast, for the bay region syn-diol epoxides this substrate selectivity was reversed, resulting in a preference for the enantiomer with the S configuration. The chemically more reactive syn diastereomers were in general better substrates for GST A1-1 than the corresponding anti diastereomers. However, a comparison between different diol epoxide diastereomers revealed no obvious correlation between chemical reactivity of the compounds and catalytic efficiencies. Furthermore, no significant correlation between diol epoxide lipophilicity and catalytic efficiency was observed. It is suggested that stereochemical factors, including the size and the geometry of the aromatic ring system and the preferred conformation of the diol epoxide, are involved as the major determinant for the rate of catalysis by GST A1-1.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.

It is not produced commercially, and it used mostly in biochemical research. PAHs are ubiquitous in combustion products of organic matter, including cigarette smoke. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: There are no data available. ANIMAL STUDIES: It has moderate carcinogenic activity. B(c)C is a unique polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that possesses both a bay region and a fjord region in the same molecule. Both bay region and fjord region terminal rings are involved in the in vitro metabolism of BcC. Metabolites of B(c)C form DNA adducts. The extent of DNA adduct formation by B[c]C in mouse skin DNA was lower than that of other moderately carcinogenic PAHs. Benzo[c]chrysene was capable of stimulating epoxide hydrolase activity, but the effect was modest, and it is a potent inducers of rat hepatic CYP1A1 activity.",

In this communication, we report that the I104,A113 allele of hGSTP1-1, which is most frequent in human populations, is also most efficient in the GSH conjugation of carcinogenic anti-diol epoxides of benzo[g]chrysene and benzo[c]phenanthrene (anti-BGCDE and anti-BCPDE, respectively). The catalytic efficiency of hGSTP1-1(I104,A113) isoform toward anti-BGCDE, 0.36 mM(-1) x s(-1), was approximately 1.7-fold higher (P < 0.05) compared with hGSTP1-1(V104,V113). Interestingly, the frequency of codon 104-valine alleles is significantly higher in certain cancers compared with codon 104-isoleucine alleles. Like anti-BGCDE, the catalytic efficiency of hGSTP1-1(I104,A113) isoform toward anti-BCPDE was higher by about 1.4- to 2.2-fold (P < 0.05) than those of other hGSTP1-1 variants. These observations are interesting because we have shown previously that the V104,V113 variant, not the I104,A113 isoform, is most efficient in the GSH conjugation of bay-region anti-diol epoxide of benzo(a)pyrene (anti-BPDE), which, unlike anti-BGCDE or anti-BCPDE, is a planar molecule. In conclusion, our results suggest that hGSTP1-1 polymorphism may be an important factor in differential susceptibility of humans to cancers where polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are etiological factors and that I104,A113 variant may play a major role in the detoxification of nonplanar, sterically hindered fjord-region diol epoxides (e.g., anti-BGCDE).",

Morphologically transformed foci were cloned, and DNA obtained from these foci was tested for the presence of Ha-ras-1 sequence by Southern blot analysis. A total of 50 transformed foci (11-14 for each diastereomer) were generated. To determine the nature of mutations responsible for activating the proto-oncogene, regions of the gene likely to contain the activating mutations were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and then subjected to hybridization with specific oligonucleotides. Gene mutations in 42 of 50 transformed foci were characterized by these methods, and most were found at codon 61 (27), followed by codons 12 (13) and 13 (two). All mutations observed were either G --> T or A --> A --> T transversions. Thirty-six were G --> T transversion mutations occurring at codons 61, 12, and 13. The remaining six were A --> T transversions at codon 61.BcCDE stereoisomers may specifically attack guanine and adenine and result in the mutations observed. Some differences in codon preference but not in the types of mutations were found among these optically active isomers. /Benzo[c]chrysene diol-epoxide/",

Recombinant (bacterial) CYP1A1 was slightly more active than any of four CYP1B1 allelic variants, CYP1B1*1, CYP1B1*2, CYP1B1*3, and CYP1B1*6, in catalyzing activation of chrysene-1,2-diol, benz[a]anthracene-trans-1,2-, 3,4-, 5,6-, and 8,9-diol, fluoranthene-2,3-diol, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, benzo[c]phenanthrene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene and several arylamines and heterocyclic amines, whereas CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 enzymes had essentially similar catalytic specificities toward other procarcinogens, such as (+)-, (-)-, and (+/-)-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol, 5-methylchrysene-1,2-diol, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene-11,12-diol, benzo[b]fluoranthene-9,10-diol, benzo[c]chrysene, 5,6-dimethylchrysene-1,2-diol, benzo[c]phenanthrene-3,4-diol, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, 5-methylchrysene, and benz[a]anthracene. We also determined activation of these procarcinogens by recombinant (T. ni) human P450 enzymes in S. typhimurium NM2009. There were good correlations between activities of procarcinogen activation by CYP1A1 preparations expressed in E. coli and T. ni cells, although basal activities with three lots of CYP1B1 in T. ni cells were very high without substrates and NADPH in our assay system. Using 14 forms of human P450s (but not CYP1B1) (in T. ni cells), we found that CYP1A2, 2C9, 3A4, and 2C19 catalyzed activation of several of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at much slower rates than those catalyzed by CYP1A1 and that other enzymes, including CYP2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C18, 2D6, 2E1, 3A5, 3A7, and 4A11, were almost inactive in the activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons examined here.",

The primary objective is to provide a rationale for the higher carcinogenic potency of 5-methylchrysene when compared to that of the parent compound and the other methyl isomers. In the presence of Aroclor 1254-induced hepatic microsomes chrysene, its 5- and 4-methyl derivatives and to a lesser extent the 2- and 3-methyl derivatives and benzo[c]chrysene elicited a positive mutagenic response. Chrysene, all derivatives studied and especially benzo[c]chrysene were potent inducers of rat hepatic CYP1A1 activity as exemplified by the O-deethylation of ethoxyresorufin (30-180-fold when activities are expressed per nmol of total cytochrome P-450). All compounds studied displaced [3H]TCDD from the cytosolic Ah receptor at a concentration of 10(-10)-10(-9) M. Benzo[c]chrysene and to a lesser extent 6-methylchrysene were the only compounds capable of stimulating epoxide hydrolase activity, but the effect was modest. None of the compounds studied could induce its own activation to mutagens in the Ames test. The present findings indicate that the higher carcinogenic potency of 5-methylchrysene cannot be related to its mutagenic potential or its ability to enhance its own activation through induction of CYP1A1 and epoxide hydrolase activities.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.0X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzo(c)chrysene will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase benzo(c)chrysene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benzo(c)chrysene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzo(c)chrysene is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 2.0X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.9X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Benzo(c)chrysene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. In general, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with four or more benzene rings do not biodegrade readily. If released into water, benzo(c)chrysene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 1.2X10+4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. However benzo(c)chrysene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to benzo(c)chrysene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzo(c)chrysene is produced as a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzo(c)chrysene via dermal contact with or inhalation of particulate matter resulting from combustion. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

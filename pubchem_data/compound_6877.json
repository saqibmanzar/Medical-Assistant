When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.3X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl anthranilate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl anthranilate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hours. Ethyl anthranilate does absorb light at UV max of 330 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethyl anthranilate is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 600. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, ethyl anthranilate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 19 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be a slow environmental fate process; estimated second order hydrolysis half-lives are 5.8 years and 210 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to ethyl anthranilate may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl anthranilate is produced or used. Use data suggest the general population may be exposed to ethyl anthranilate via ingestion of food, and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing ethyl anthranilate. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

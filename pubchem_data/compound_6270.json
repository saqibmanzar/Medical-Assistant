PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Currently available MHb formers present certain drawbacks and limitations. The purpose of this study was to characterize, in mice, the hematologic effects of the MHb-forming compound p-aminopropiophenone (PAPP), and two structurally-related p-aminophenones, p-aminoheptanoylphenone (PAHP) and p-aminooctanoylphenone (PAOP). Although these three p-aminophenones have been shown previously to be efficacious as pretreatments against CN, a more complete understanding of their hematologic effects is lacking. In addition, because the active form of PAPP has been shown to be its N-hydroxy metabolite, the N-hydroxy metabolites of PAPP, PAHP and PAOP were also tested. Using a hemoximeter, blood samples obtained -2 to +180 min relative to intramuscular (im) or intraperitoneal (ip) drug injections were evaluated. Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and the appropriate solvents served as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Dose-, time-, route-, and compound-related effects were observed. MHb and sulfhemoglobin levels increased, whereas levels of those parameters related to oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, such as, oxygen saturation and oxyhemoglobin decreased. In general, the effects of PAHP and PAOP were longer lasting than those of PAPP and NaNO2. Furthermore, PAPP and NaNO2 were equally effective with either route of administration. Conversely, PAHP and PAOP showed larger effects when administered ip versus im. The animals treated with N-hydroxy metabolites of the p-aminophenones also showed similar changes in the hematological parameters measured. N-hydroxy PAPP was shown to be the most rapidly acting MHb-forming compound examined in this series. It could achieve therapeutic concentrations of MHb within 2 min and thus may be considered as a treatment for CN intoxication...",

In cancer therapy, the protection of normal tissue without protecting tumors is one way to increase the therapeutic gain. Thiol compounds are currently in clinical trials, but are limited to some extent by their human toxicities including hypotension, nausea, and emesis. Several new aminochalcones and aminobenzophenones were synthesized and tested for radioprotective activity in mice. All were less active than p-aminobenzophenone itself. Several acid hydrazides were synthesized and tested similarly, but none exhibited significant activity. The high radioprotective activity of 4-nitroaniline was confirmed, but other nitro amines were substantially less active. 4-Chloro-N-methylaniline is as active as 4-chloroaniline, but other chloro aromatics are devoid of significant activity. When compared with the phosphorothioate amyfostine (WR-2721) using the intestinal clonogenic cell survival assay, 1-(p-aminophenyl)-1-propanol, p-aminopropiophenone, its ethylene ketal, and a mixture of the two protected to a great extent, though slightly less than WR-2721.

The peak methemoglobin was stated to lagged behind the peak plasma drug concentration by at least 60 minutes. This report proposes that PAPP is oxidized by cytochrome P450 (possibly in the lung) and then enters the blood where some of active metabolite oxidizes hemoglobin. This study demonstrates relatively high and rapid absorption via the oral route ... The short period time before the peak methemoglobin concentration (about 90 minutes for PAPP) indicates that the substance is readily metabolized and excreted, as would be expected from the structure of the molecule (with the possible exception of cats)."

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Many antidotes to cyanide poisoning oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin (metHb), which serves as a scavenger of the cyanide anion. However, sufficiently high levels of metHb can be toxic because metHb cannot bind O2 until it is reduced. The purpose of the proposed study was twofold: (1) Characterize the time course of metHb formation for different doses of p-aminopropiophenone (PAPP), a drug that oxidizes hemoglobin and can be used as an antidote to cyanide intoxication; and (2) Determine whether the effort of an operant response affects the behavioral toxicity of metHb, since more effortful responses presumably are more energetically demanding. In Experiment I, the oral metHb kinetics of p-aminopropiophenone (PAPP) were studied; four doses of PAPP (1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) or the vehicle, polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200), were delivered via a gavage tube to separate groups of rats. In Experiment II, rats were trained to press a lever or run in an activity wheel at any time during a 12-hour light/dark cycle for their entire daily food intake; five presses or turns were required for the delivery of each food pellet. The same doses of PAPP were delivered /orally/  shortly before the onset of darkness, 2100 hr. Results from Exp I showed that PAPP induced a dose-dependent rapid increase and relatively slower exponential-like decline in metHb concentration. In Exp. II, the same doses of PAPP induced a dose-dependent reduction in hourly outputs of leverpresses and wheelturns however; wheelturns were reduced significantly more than leverpresses. When the best-fitting metHb curves from Experiment I were superimposed on the time scale for outputs of wheelturns and leverpresses, reduction of output was inversely related to the kinetics of metHb formation. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that PAPP-induced metHb formation reduced the output of wheelrunning more than leverpressing because the more energetically demanding response of wheelrunning was more affected by metHb induced hypoxemia. Furthermore, these data suggest that although certain longacting metHb formers might be useful prophylactics for warfighters, it will be critical to determine the energetic loads of required battlefield activities because even low (10%) therapeutic metHb levels might impair the performance of those activities.",

Schiff base formation reduced toxicity of the parent amines; its effect on radioprotective activity was erratic, increasing activity in some cases, decreasing activity in others, and having no effect in ... others. Radioprotective activity appears to be unrelated to a number of molecular descriptors. The highest radioprotection (100%) was observed for mixtures of p-aminopropiophenone with its Schiff base, or with the Schiff base of 1-(p-aminophenyl)-1-propanol (95%).",

Evidence presented here suggests that other mechanisms may be involved. Male Swiss ICR mice were pretreated intraperitoneally (ip) with various doses of primaquine phosphate (primaquine), WR6026 (6-methoxy-8-(6-diethylamino-hexylamino) lepidine dihydrochloride), WR238605 (8-[(4-amino-1-methylbutyl)amino]-2,6-dimethoxy-4-methyl-5-(3-trifluoromethylphenoxy) quinoline succinate), p-aminooctoyl-phenone (PAOP), or p-aminopropiophenone (PAPP). The compounds were administered 15 or 60 min before an intramuscular (im) challenge with a 2xLD50 dose (5.0-5.6 mg/kg) of sodium cyanide (NaCN). Twenty-four hr /later/ mortality was assessed and survivors were tested for motor incapacitation. Primaquine, PAPP and PAOP increased survival compared to untreated controls, while the other MHb formers were not effective (P < 0.05). PAOP is believed to form sufficient MHb only after 3 to 4 hr after administration; however it was found to be effective when administered 15 min before NaCN challenge in this study. This suggests that MHb formation may not be the only factor responsible for PAOP's anti-cyanide efficacy.",

Elevated MHb (>20%) in sheep after benzocaine exposure was recently recognized. MHb decreases blood oxygen-carrying capacity which can complicate interpretation of experimental data. Sheep are used in research which requires tracheal intubation and blood gas analysis. Since benzocaine and lidocaine are used to provide local anesthesia prior to intubation, we compared MHb production by sheep after exposure to these drugs. A dose-response relationship between benzocaine and MHb was investigated. Eight crossbred Dorset ewes were dosed intranasally with benzocaine for 2 sec or with 40 mg of lidocaine in a randomized crossover design. Sheep with elevated MHb after the 2-sec benzocaine dose were later dosed with benzocaine intranasally for 10 sec. MHb levels were measured periodically on a CO-Oximeter. A quantitative MHb response to an indirect MHb former, p-aminopropiophenone (PAPP), by each sheep was determined 15 min after PAPP (0.6 mg/kg iv). MHb levels remained at baseline (1-2%) after lidocaine exposure in all sheep, as well as in four sheep (nonresponders) after the 2-sec benzocaine dose. Four sheep (responders) demonstrated 16.5-26.4% MHb after the 2-sec benzocaine dose. The responders formed 38.2-50.5% MHb after the 10-sec benzocaine dose. All responders developed high MHb after PAPP, while nonresponders developed slightly elevated MHb after PAPP. An N-hydroxy metabolite of benzocaine is the likly active MHb-forming substance. Benzocaine should be replaced by lidocaine when local anesthesia of the nasal or oropharyngeal region in sheep is required.",

With rat liver and NADPH in single and two-compartment systems, dapsone and benzocaine were more potent methemoglobin generators compared with 4-PAPP. In the single compartment studies, the order of potency of inhibition of 4-PAPP-mediated methemoglobin formation was cimetidine (1.5 mM)>isoniazid (500 uM)/diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC, 1 mM)>erythromycin (500 uM). Human liver microsomal activation of 4-PAPP in the two-compartment system was partially inhibited by both DDC and cimetidine.

As assessed by circulating levels after intra-peritoneal administration, p-AT was the least potent compound of the series, but nitrobenzene and aniline were also only weakly active even at lethal doses. Three hydroxylamine analogues from the above series were all about equipotent as methemoglobin forming agents in mice. Moreover, at a dose of 0.1 mole/kg each produced a transient methemoglobinemia that was remarkably similar to that resulting from p-APP. A methemoglobinemia with similar temporal characteristics was also produced by o-aminophenol, but this compound is about ten times less potent. p-Aminophenol was even weaker, being about as active as aniline. When aniline or nitrobenzene was given in combination with sodium nitrite, circulating methemoglobin levels were prolonged. Such a synergism was not seen when either was given in combination with p-APP. Methylene blue in vivo attenuated the methemoglobinemic response to both p-APP and nitrite. It was more effective, however, against the latter, as evaluated at doses that produced equivalent peak circulating levels. In its time pattern the effect of nitrite was similar in vivo (intact mouse) and in vitro (mouse red cell suspension). In contrast, methemoglobinemia produced by phenylhydroxylamine appears to persist longer in red cells than in the intact animal. Apparently, factors external to the red cell are important in terminating some kinds of induced methemoglobinemias.",

The degree of protection correlated with anticipated levels of methemoglobinemia. Pretreatment of mice with nitrite or PAPP significantly prolonged their survival during continuous vapor exposure to any one of three concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, but the greatest protection occurred at the intermediate concentration. Under certain conditions propylene glycol also prolonged survival time, probably by a nonspecific action in depressing respirations. The mechanism of protection against sulfide by methemoglobinemia is discussed with reference to the formation of sulfmethemoglobin and its possible fate in vivo.",

There were 51 individuals (assumed to be male, but this is not stated), aged between 23- 52 years of age. There exposures were to 100 mg (13 cases), 80 mg (37 cases) or 50 mg (1 case) PAPP. The study showed that it takes 15- 30 minutes for MetHb to develop, with the peak level being reached 1- 2 hours after consumption. In most individual receiving 80 or 100 mg the MetHb level was higher than 5% for at least 4 hours. The group data summaries were: 100 mg group: distribution of maximum level was 22 +/-14% (range 2- 48%); 80 mg group: distribution of maximum level was 13.1 +/-9% (range 0- 43%). [The one individual consuming 50 mg had 7% MetHb.]  Effect of body weight: Due to the lack of adjustment of dose based on body weight, the MetHb response varied depending on body weight. For individual receiving 100 mg with MetHb concentrations >20% the average body weight was 63kg (average dose (1.28 mg/kg bw), while for those with 20%, the average body weight was 78 (1.59 mg/kg bw). For the individuals receiving 80 mg, the equivalent data are for MetHb concentrations >10% the average body weight was 71kg (average dose (1.13 mg/kg bw), while for those with 10%, the average body weight was 76 (1.05 mg/kg bw). Effect of food consumption: The study also appeared to demonstrate (based on different data) involving individuals who had consumed PAPP a long or short time after a meal that the MetHb level tends to be higher if it is a long time since a meal had been consumed, which was believed to be due to stomach acidity, but it may also related to dissolution of PAPP in lipid. Variability: The study also demonstrated that a small number of individuals are relatively resistant to the effects of MetHb generating substances. The report indicates 2-3 individuals in their group of 51 [but the generalizability of this to the human population needs caution, as the study is presumed to be of adult, male Caucasians only]. Questionnaires did not identify any subjective discomfort associated with the exposure to PAPP, even in individuals who had MetHb levels of 30- 40% and who were demonstrating clear signs of methemoglobinemia (blue lips). No changes in the ventilation rates or blood pressure were seen in comparison to pre-treatment values. Electrocardiograms for 20 of the individuals were carried out. There were no changes in 18 individuals, but two individuals, both of whom received the 80 mg dose [aged 25 and 37, weighing 67kg and 100 kg respectively] were found to have slight changes that were reported as minimal. The MetHb levels were respectively in these individuals were 24% and 4.5%."

Acute oral toxicity of PAPP in brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), dama wallabies (Macropus eugenii), and Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) was estimated in pen trials, carried out between February 2000 and September 2001. The susceptibility of possums (LD50>or=500 mg/kg) and wallabies (LD50 89 mg/kg) to PAPP was low in comparison to noncarnivorous placental mammal species, but ducks (LD50 38 mg/kg) were more susceptible than other bird species. These results suggest that the nontarget hazard to possums and wallabies from PAPP bait applied for pest predator control would be low. However, future development of PAPP as a vertebrate pest control agent should include rigorous assessments of the hazard posed by bait formulations to bird species and provision for delivery techniques that could mitigate exposure of nontarget birds.",

Its use as a vertebrate toxic agent in New Zealand will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.0X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-aminopropiophenone will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-aminopropiophenone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.3 hours. Particulate-phase 4-aminopropiophenone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 4-Aminopropiophenone absorbs light at wavelengths of 310.3 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 4-aminopropiophenone is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 50. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.6X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. 4-Aminopropiophenone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, 4-aminopropiophenone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of one suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 4-aminopropiophenone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-aminopropiophenone is produced or used. Use data indicate that exposure to 4-aminopropiophenone will be limited to those administered this compound in drug products containing 4-aminopropiophenone, a cyanide antidote. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 4-aminopropiophenone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.3 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 9.9X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase 4-aminopropiophenone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 4-Aminopropiophenone absorbs light at wavelengths of 310.3 nm(4), and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

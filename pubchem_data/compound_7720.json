If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Two others were given the same amount of (14)C-EH and cottonseed oil, but also were given 0.1 mL (0.64 mmol) of unlabeled 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. Following administration of the test substance, rats were housed in metabolism cages with ad libitum access to feed and water; expired CO2, urine, and feces were collected every hour for 28 hrs. Most (99.8%) of the orally administered radioactivity was accounted for by radioactivity in expired CO2, urine, feces, an ethanol wash of the metabolism cage at the end of the experiment, heart, brain, liver, kidneys, and \"residual carcass.\" 2-Ethyl-1-hexanol was efficiently absorbed following oral administration and rapidly excreted in respired CO2 (6-7%), urine (80-82%), and feces (8-9%); elimination was essentially complete by 28 hrs. The major urinary metabolite of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol in the rat was shown to be 2-ethylhexanoic acid through acid extraction of urine. This metabolite can undergo partial B-oxidation and decarboxylation to produce (14)CO2 and 2- and 4-heptanone (in the urine). Other urinary metabolites of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were identified as 2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexanoic acid, 2-ethyl-5-ketohexanoic acid, and 2-ethyl-1,6-hexanedioic acid.

Dermal exposures to (14)C-2-ethyl-1-hexanol (1 g/kg bw applied dose) for 6 hr and iv exposures to 1 mg/kg bw (14)C-2-ethyl-1-hexanol were also studied. Acute oral doses of 50 or 500 mg/kg bw and repeated oral doses of 50 mg/kg bw/day showed similar excretion balance profiles of (14)C, with some evidence of metabolic saturation at the high dose. No evidence of metabolic induction was reported following repeated dosing. All oral doses were rapidly eliminated during the first 24 hours after dosing, predominantly in the urine. Approximately 5% of the dermal dose was absorbed. A majority of the oral and dermal doses were eliminated as glucuronides of oxidized metabolites of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol principally glucuronides of 2-ethyladipic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, 5-hydroxy-2-ethylhexanoic acid, and 6-hydroxy-2-ethylhexanoic acid.

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

This study examines if the chemosensory perception of 2-ethylhexanol is capable to distract performance in demanding neurobehavioral tasks. In two experiments three time-weighted average concentrations of 2-ethylhexanol (C(TWA): 1.5, 10, and 20 ppm) were investigated. In experiment A (n=24) variable concentrations over time (4 hr) were used, experiment B (n=22) investigated constant concentrations. The experiments were conducted in a 29 cu m exposure laboratory. Cross-over designs with randomized sequences of exposures were used. Among the 46 male participants 19 subjects reported enhanced chemical sensitivity; the other 27 subjects did not show this personality feature. During the exposure periods neurobehavioral tests were presented twice (beginning; end), the intensity of chemosensory perceptions were rated thrice. The intensity of chemosensory perceptions showed a clear dose-dependency. Subjects' performance in the vigilance test was not affected by the different exposures. Moreover, the results of neurobehavioral tests measuring executive function were neither affected by the C(TWA) concentration nor by the exposure peaks. With increasing C(TWA), a subgroup of the chemically sensitive subjects showed deteriorated accuracy in a divided attention task. Especially the 20 ppm conditions were very annoying. Only during the constant 10 ppm condition the time courses of the annoyance and nasal irritation ratings indicated some adaptation. In general, with the applied neurobehavioral tests distractive effects of acute 2-ethylhexanol exposures up to 20 ppm could not be confirmed. In sensitive groups such distractive effects of irritating solvents might be conceivable and moreover, in cooperation with researchers from cognitive neuroscience more sensitive functions and tests should be developed and incorporated.",

Mean exposure levels of 1.5, 10 and 20 ppm were realized in experimental models simulating either constant or variable 4 hr exposure. Each study was carried out with two subject samples, healthy young men with self-reported multiple chemical sensitivity (sMCS) and age matched controls. Although 2-ethylhexanol exposure was below the occupational threshold limit value of 50 ppm, the study revealed strong dose-response relationships between airborne solvent concentrations and blink rates. During 40 ppm peak exposures the blink rate increased threefold. In the course of 4 hr, exposure blink rates increased significantly showing no adaptation. Subjects with sMCS revealed, with one exception at start of exposure, no significantly higher blink rates than controls. The results indicate that the irritative potential of 2-ethylhexanol is higher than commonly expected. In both exposure scenarios with either constant or peak exposures, electromyographic eye blink recordings were an appropriate method for the examination of acute sensory irritations in time.",

Sixteen males and fourteen females were in random order exposed to 1 mg/cu m of vapors of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol or to clean air (control exposure) in an exposure chamber during 2 hr at rest. The subjects performed symptom ratings on Visual Analog Scales. During exposure to 2-ethyl-1-hexanol subjective ratings of smell and eye discomfort were minimally but significantly increased. Ratings of nasal irritation, throat irritation, headache, dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and intoxication were not significantly affected. No exposure-related effects on measurement of blinking frequency by electromyography, measurement of the eye break-up time, vital staining of the eye, nasal lavage biomarkers, transfer tests, spirometric and rhinometric measures were seen. No differences in response were seen between sexes or between atopics and non-atopics. It is important to assess acute effects in volatile organic compounds like 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. 2-ethyl-1-hexanol is often found in indoor air generated by degradation of plastic building materials or in new buildings. There are associations between 2-ethyl-1-hexanol in indoor air and respiratory effects, eye irritation, headache, and blurred vision. A controlled chamber exposure study in acute effects was performed. In conclusion, this study showed weak subjective symptom of irritation in the eyes.",

Microencapsulated 2-ethylhexanol (0%, 0.009%, 0.03%, or 0.09% in feed) was provided on gestational days (gd) 0 to 17 ad libitum to timed-mated CD-1 mice (28/group). At sacrifice (gd 17),the number of ovarian corpora lutea and uterine implantation sites, including resorptions, and dead or live fetuses, were recorded. ... No dams died, delivered early or were removed from study. Pregnancy rate was high (93-96%) and equivalent across all groups. One litter at 0% was fully resorbed; all other pregnant animals had live litters at scheduled necropsy. The numbers of live litters evaluated were 27 at 0.009 and 0.03% and 26 at 0 and 0.09% 2-ethylhexanol. There was no treatment-related maternal toxicity observed in this study. Maternal body weights, weight gains (absolute or corrected for gravid uterine weight), gravid uterine weight and liver weight (absolute or relative to body weight) were unaffected. Food consumption (g/kg/day and g/day) was significantly increased for gd 0-3 at 0.09% and unaffected for all other time points evaluated. The calculated consumption of 2-ethylhexanol, based on gestational food consumption was 0 (0 mmol/kg), 17 (0.13 mmol/kg), 59 (0.46 mmol/kg) and 191 mg/kg/day (1.49 mmol/kg), for the 0, 0.009, 0.03 and 0.090% groups, respectively. There were no effects of exposure to dietary 2-ethylhexanol on any gestational parameters. The number of corpora lutea, uterine implantation sites (live, dead, resorbed), pre- and post implantation loss, sex ratio (%, males) and live fetal body weight per litter (all fetuses or separately by sex) were all equivalent across all groups. There were also no treatment-related changes in the incidence of individual, external, visceral, skeletal or total malformations or variations. In conclusion, there were no maternal or developmental toxic effects of 2-ethylhexanol dietary exposure throughout gestation at any concentration tested, in contrast to the qualitatively similar maternal and developmental toxicity previously reported for di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ... and mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (NTP, 1990) at approximately equimolar doses administered under comparable experimental conditions. The present study therefore indicates that 2-ethylhexanol plays essentially no role in the expression of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate-induced maternal and developmental toxicity.",

The exception was the multiple treatment males, whose percentage was increased at a statistically significant level (0.01 <= P <= 0.05).

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.136 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-ethylhexanol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-ethylhexanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 26 hours. 2-Ethylhexanol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-ethylhexanol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 35. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Ethylhexanol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Based on 31, 52, and 5% biodegradation when incubated for 21 days in soil from a waste disposal site, in soil amended with nitrogen, and in soil incubated under anaerobic conditions, respectively, biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, 2-ethylhexanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Using river water incubated at 18-19 \u00b0C, 59% biodegradation after 9 days suggests that biodegradation may be an important enviornmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 41 hours and 16 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 30 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2-ethylhexanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-ethylhexanol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-ethylhexanol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound or other products containing 2-ethylhexanol.

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 41 hours and 16 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 30(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.73(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Bottled water, 12 samples of each, in glass and poly(ethylene terephthalate)(PET) containers from lots showing similar and unpleasant organoleptic characteristics contained 2.1-10.9 ug/L, 5.5 ug/L mean and not detected (detection limit 0.5 ug/L), respectively(3). However, the authors suggest that the 2-ethylhexanol was a contaminant in the gasket material of the caps and that during the 35-45 day period between bottling and analysis, the 2-ethylhexanol may have biodegraded in the PET containers, that favor biodegradation, but not in the glass containers(3). 2-Ethylhexanol was found in drinking water in a pilot study of personal exposure in Bayonne and Elixabeth, New Jersey carried out between July and December 1980(4).",

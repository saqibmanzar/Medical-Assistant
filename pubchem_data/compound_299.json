Mirex was used to control fire ants, and as a flame retardant in plastics, rubber, paint, paper, and electrical goods from 1959 to 1972. Chlordecone was used as an insecticide on tobacco, ornamental shrubs, bananas, and citrus trees, and in ant and roach traps. Mirex was sold as a flame retardant under the trade name Dechlorane, and chlordecone was also known as Kepone.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Gerbils eliminated chlordecone alcohol exclusively in stool with none being detected in urine. Gerbils excreted chlordecone alcohol in bile in an amount more than twice that of chlordecone and in the form of a glucuronide conjugate. The ratio of chlordecone to chlordecone alcohol in gerbil stool was 10 times higher than the ratio in human stool. This suggests that the newly recognized nonbiliary mechanism(s) for entry of chlordecone into the intestinal lumen may be extremely active in the gerbil. Incubation of the cytosolic fraction of gerbil liver homogenate in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and chlordecone produced chlordecone alcohol. Bioreduction of chlordecone is catalyzed in gerbil liver by a species-specific reductase. The livers of these (3)H-chlordecone alcohol treated animals also contained chlordecone in amounts eight times (rat) and 14 times (gerbil) higher than the respective amounts of chlordecone alcohol. From this result, the existence of a separate enzyme(s) catalyzing dehydrogenation of chlordecone alcohol to chlordecone may be inferred.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

At very high levels, chlordecone depressed ATPase activity or cellular energy utilization at moderate to relatively high doses (2.5 to 100 mg/kg/day and 50 to 100 mg/kg/day, respectively) thereby inhibiting the biliary excretion of substances. The inhibition does not appear to be due to inhibition of the metabolism of the substance to be excreted in the bile or to decreased bile flow. Possible explanations for the decreased excretion of metabolites in the bile include decreased uptake of substances by the hepatocyte, a decreased transfer of chemicals from the hepatocyte to the bile, and leaking of metabolites from the bile duct via a paracellular pathway. The decrease in transfer may be due to decreased permeability of the canalicular membrane resulting from inhibition of the mg2+ATPase activity of the bile canaliculi or perturbations of plasma membrane.",

In the present study, OCs were demonstrated to also alter the activity and expression of human hepatic drug transporters. Activity of the sinusoidal influx transporter OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1) was thus inhibited by endosulfan, chlordane, heptachlor, lindane, and dieldrine, but not by dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane isomers, whereas those of the canalicular efflux pumps MRP2 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 2) and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) were blocked by endosulfan, chlordane, heptachlor, and chlordecone; this latter OC additionally inhibited the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1)/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity. OCs, except endosulfan, were next found to induce MDR1/P-gp and MRP2 mRNA expressions in hepatoma HepaRG cells; some of them also upregulated BCRP. By contrast, expression of sinusoidal transporters was not impaired (organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP2B1) or was downregulated (sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) and OCT1). Such regulations of drug transporter activity and expression, depending on the respective nature of OCs and transporters, may contribute to the toxicity of OC pesticides.",

Control rats received 0.3 mL of corn oil. Complete body movements (including tremors) were monitored for a period of 12 hr, and at 24, 48, and 72 hr after treatment. Rats receiving chlordecone showed an increased tremor activity which was significant and dose dependent. The brain synaptosomal sodium-potassium ion and oligomycin sensitive magnesium ion ATPases were significantly decreased in chlordecone treated rats. A linear relationship was observed between the decreases in ATPase activities and tremor activity. These results suggest that the inhibition of the ATPase system in the brain may be related to the production of the neurotoxic symptoms.",

As a result of this intense use, up to 20,000 ha are contaminated by this insecticide in the French West Indies, and this causes environmental damage and health problems. A scenario of exposure was drawn by French authorities, based on land usage records. Many efforts have been made to monitor the occurrence of chlordecone and its main metabolites using different analytical methods, including GC, GC/MS, LC/MS, and NIRS. Although these different methods allow for the detection and quantification of chlordecone from soils, none of them estimate the bottleneck caused by extraction of this organochlorine from soils with high adsorption ability. In this study, we used (13)C10-chlordecone as a tracer to estimate chlordecone extraction yield and to quantify chlordecone in soil extracts based on the (13)C/(12)C isotope dilution. We report the optimization of (13)C10-chlordecone extraction from an Andosol. The method was found to be linear from 0.118 to 43 mg/kg in the Andosol, with an instrumental detection limit estimated at 8.84 ug/kg. This method showed that chlordecone ranged from 35.4 down to 0.18 mg/kg in Andosol, Nitisol, Ferralsol, and Fluvisol soil types. Traces of the metabolite beta-monohydrochlordecone were detected in the Andosol, Nitisol, and Ferralsol soil samples. This last result indicates that this method could be useful to monitor the fate of chlordecone in soils of the French West Indies.",

The method consists in analysis by gas chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry after pressurized liquid extraction. The high natural content of organic matter in the soils coupled with the additional exogenous organic matter from the amendments tested lead to a complex extract. Trans-nonachlor was used as surrogate to correct the results for extraction efficiency, and (13)C chlordecone was added as internal standard to mimic as closely as possible the behavior of chlordecone and suppress possible side effects during its analysis. The key parameters of the method (linearity, repeatability, interday precision, specificity, extraction efficiency and limit of quantification) were validated in accordance with the NF T 90-210 standard method. The limit of quantification is 0.03 mg/kg. Uncertainty (k=2) was 40 % for concentrations lower than or equal to 1 mg/kg, and 30 % for concentrations greater than 1 mg/kg.",

We have thus evaluated a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging quantification method based on labeled normalization for the in situ localization and quantification of chlordecone. After validating the linearity and the reproducibility of this method, quantitative MALDI imaging was used to study the accumulation of chlordecone in the mouse liver. Our results revealed that normalized intensities measured by MALDI imaging could be first converted in quantitative units. These quantities appeared to be different from absolute quantities of chlordecone determined by gas chromatography (GC), but they were perfectly correlated (R(2) = 0.995). The equation of the corresponding correlation curve was thus efficiently used to convert quantities measured by MALDI imaging into absolute quantities. Our method combining labeled normalization and calibration with an orthogonal technique allowed the in situ absolute quantification of chlordecone by MALDI imaging. Finally, our results obtained on the pathological mouse liver illustrate the advantages of quantitative MALDI imaging which preserves information on in situ localization without radioactive labeling and with a simple sample preparation.",

The aim of our work was to include chlordecone in a multi organochlorine residue method preventing any degradation during the analytical process and thus allowing quantification at ppt (ng/kg or ng/L) levels for a wide range of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in breast milk, human serum and adipose tissue. After GC-HRMS vs. MS/MS and EI vs. APCI comparisons, the major improvement in terms of sensitivity was found in decreasing the length and film thickness of the gas chromatography column. Thanks to a linear correlation between relative response and quantity of chlordecone injected, LC-(ESI-)-MS/MS was finally preferred. An acetonitrile based gradient optimized on a C30 coreshell HPLC column has led to reaching limits of quantification as low as 8 ng/L, 25 pg/mL and 0.2 ng/g fat for breast milk, serum and adipose tissue, respectively, allowing multiresidue OCP quantification at concentration levels compatible with biomonitoring purposes and pre-requisites.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

From March 1974 to June 1975, the LSP recorded output of chlordecone was 769,390 kg. The total production was certainly above this figure, but massive amounts of chlordecone found their way into the soil, water, and air surrounding the plant. The workers in the plant and the families in the area were exposed to extremely high concentrations of chlordecone dust.  High volume air samplers, 200 m from the plant, recorded chlordecone levels as high as 54.8 mg/cu m, which constituted 50% of the total particulate load.  Lower concentrations of chlordecone were detected in the air 25 km away from the plant.  Concentrations of chlordecone dust within the plant were not monitored, but levels reaching 11.8 mg/liter were found in blood samples of workers from the LSP.  Illness was found in 76 of the 133 current and former workers of the plant examined.  Families of the LSP workers were also examined, as well as Allied Chemical Corporation people working in the area of the plant, workers from the sewage treatment plant that received chlordecone sludge, and residents of Hopewell.  It was found that the blood levels of workers who were ill, averaged 2.53 mg/liter, whereas the average level in workers not reporting ill was 0.60 mg/liter.",

It was used as a fungicide and acaricide. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Chemical workers repeatedly exposed to high concentrations of kepone dust developed nervousness and tremors, visual disturbances including rapid erratic eye movement, and occasionally ataxia, chest pain, arthralgia, erythematous skin eruption, and weight loss. Oligospermia was found in some workers. Both pre- and postnatal low chronic exposure to kepone is associated with negative effects on cognitive and motor development during infancy. Prenatal exposure to kepone is associated with specific impairments in fine motor function in boys. Postnatal exposure was associated with lower height, weight and BMI at 3, 8 and 18 months, particularly in girls. ANIMAL STUDIES: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice, approximately 6 weeks of age, were fed technical-grade kepone at two levels in the diet for 80 weeks. Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas were found in over 80% of all treated males. Chlordecone was administered to female rats at concentrations of 2.5 mg/kg body weight per day and to mice at 6.0 - 24 mg/kg body weight per day on days 7 - 16 of gestation and also postpartum. Although there were toxic manifestations in the mother (death) and fetuses (litter mortality, decreased litter weight), ophthalmological studies did not reveal cataracts or outlined lenses. Kepone was negative for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome preincubation assay in 5 Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA97, TA98, and TA100). ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Ingestion of 160 ppm kepone increased quail mortality, produced a decrease in egg production, and affected the normal sequence of egg laying. Kepone accumulates in prawn tissues and could affect key molecules involved in the reproduction and the growth of the invertebrate M. rosenbergii. Low concentrations of kepone cause reductions in both algal growth and invertebrate populations, thereby affecting productivity at other trophic levels.",

Chlordecone causes spontaneous neurotransmitter release and increases in free intracellular calcium in synaptosomes by increasing permeability of the plasma membrane, activating voltage-dependent calcium channels, inhibiting of brain mitochondrial calcium uptake, and decreasing the activity of calmodulin-stimulated enzymes and Na+/K+, Mg+, and Ca+ ATPases. This inhibition of membrane ATPases also impairs energy-dependent cellular processes. Chlordecone causes its reproductive effects by binding to the estrogen and androgen receptors.

The effects of difluromethylornithine on chlordecone-induced tremor were reversed by pretreatment with putrescine. Difluromethylornithine had no effects on 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane, a tremorigen having a mechanism of action different from chlordecone. ...",

Low doses of the OC insecticide chlordecone (CD) alter hepatic disposition of lipophilic xenobiotics and perturb lipid homeostasis in rainbow trout, mice and rats. CD pretreatment altered tissue and hepatic subcellular distribution of exogenous [(14)C]cholesterol (CH) equivalents 4 and 16 hr after a bolus intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 5 mL corn oil/kg that contained 10 mg CH/kg. CD pretreatment altered tissue distribution of exogenously administered [(14)C]CH by decreased hepatic and renal accumulation, and increased biliary excretion up to 300%. Biliary excretion of polar [(14)C]CH metabolites was not altered by CD. CD pretreatment decreased subcellular distribution of [(14)C]CH equivalents in hepatic cytosol and microsomes and lipoprotein-rich fraction-to-homogenate ratio. CD pretreatment increased the ratio of [(14)C]CH equivalents in high density lipoprotein (HDL) to that in plasma and reduced [(14)C]CH equivalents in the non-HDL fraction 4 hr after a bolus lipid dose. CD pretreatment increased plasma non-HDL total CH by 80% 4 hr after a bolus lipid dose. Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and ATP-binding cassette transporter G8 (ABCG8) proteins were quantified by western blotting in hepatic membranes from control and CD treated mice. Liver membrane contents of SR-BI and ABCG8 proteins were unchanged by CD pretreatment. The data demonstrated that a single dose of CD altered CH homeostasis and lipoprotein metabolism.",

OC insecticides alter lipid homeostasis in rodents at doses that are not neurotoxic or carcinogenic. Pretreatment of mice or rats with CD altered tissue distribution of a subsequent dose of [(14)C]CD or [(14)C]cholesterol (CH). Nuclear receptors regulate expression of genes important in the homeostasis of CH and other lipids. In this study, we report that CD suppresses in vitro reporter systems for human liver X receptors (LXRs) and activates those for human farnesoid X receptor (FXR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in a concentration-dependent manner (0-50 muM). Consistent with human PXR activation in vitro, three days after a single dose of CD (15 mg/kg) hepatic microsomal CYP3A11 protein increases in C57BL/6 mice. CD decreases hepatic CH ester content without altering total CH concentration. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) contents of hepatic lipoprotein-rich and microsomal fractions of CD-treated mice are higher than controls. There is a significant reduction in non-high density lipoprotein CH but not apolipoprotein B-48/100 (apoB-48/100) in plasma from CD-treated mice after a 4 hr fast. At 14 days after 15 mg CD/kg apoA-I and apoB-100 proteins but not CYP3A11 protein in hepatic microsomes are similar to controls. This work indicates that altered CH homeostasis is a mode of OC insecticide action of relevance after a single dose. This at least partially explains altered CH tissue distribution in CD-pretreated mice.",

Several OCs have been reported to inhibit crustacean molting. To determine whether the disruption of crustacean molting by these OCs involves interference with ecdysteroid signaling in the epidermis, the impacts of five molt-inhibiting OCs on the level of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG, EC 3.2.1.30) mRNA in cultured epidermal tissues from the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, were investigated using quantitative real-time PCR. The NAG mRNA was found to be inducible by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) in cultured epidermal tissues. The inducibility of NAG mRNA in cultured epidermal tissues by 20-HE is not only further direct evidence that epidermal expression of NAG gene in U. pugilator is controlled by the molting hormone but also validates the use of the NAG mRNA as a biomarker for epidermal ecdysteroid signaling. When Aroclor 1242, 2,4,5-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB29), endosulfan or kepone was administered alone, the expression of NAG gene in cultured epidermal tissues was upregulated, while heptachlor had no effects. Under binary exposure to both 20-HE and an OC, a condition similar to the natural hormonal milieu of epidermal tissues of animals impacted by OCs, both Aroclor 1242 and endosulfan were found to be capable of antagonizing ecdysteroid signaling in cultured epidermal tissues. This antagonizing effect on epidermal ecdysteroid signaling can at least partly explain the inhibitory effects of these two agents on crustacean molting. PCB29, when given together with 20-HE, produced an additive effect on epidermal ecdysteroid signaling but such an additive effect was not observed when kepone was combined with 20-HE.",

Kepone is a main degradation product of the formerly used insecticide mirex and occurs in soil as a result of mirex application. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.25X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates kepone will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase kepone is not expected to be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. However, kepone readily forms hydrates on exposure to ordinary temperatures and humidities. Vapor-phase kepone hydrate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 38 days. Particulate-phase kepone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Kepone and kepone hydrate are susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, kepone is expected to have no mobility based upon Koc values of 3330, 7440 and 15850. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Kepone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. However, laboratory tests have measured small amounts of kepone volatilization from soil. Biodegradation of kepone can occur in soil and water, but it is a very slow environmental process. Microbial mineralization of 14C-kepone was demonstrated in two tropical soils under aerobic conditions, but the rate of 14-CO2 evolution was only 3.2-4.9% after 215 days of incubation. Monitoring data indicate kepone residues can exist in soil for years after pesticidal applications. Kepone is a persistent organochlorine insecticide that still has an environmental impact decades after its ban. If released into water, kepone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. A half-life of >312 days was measured using an estuarine sediment inoculum. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF range of 900-9,354 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Kepone hydrates in aqueous solution to form the gem-diol kepone hydrate. Occupational exposure to kepone may be non-existent since kepone is no longer produced or used in the US. Monitoring data indicate that the general population was most likely to be in contact with kepone via ingestion of food, in particular fish and dairy products. (SRC)",

Volatilization of kepone from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.25X10-7 mm Hg(4), and water solubility of 2.7 mg/L(4). Kepone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure. However, laboratory tests have measured small amounts of kepone volatilization from soil(4). Biodegradation of kepone can occur, but it is a very slow environmental process(5). A half-life of >312 days was measured using an estuarine sediment inoculum(6). Microbial mineralization of 14C-kepone was demonstrated in two tropical soils under aerobic conditions, but the rate of 14-CO2 evolution was only 3.2-4.9% after 215 days of incubation(2). Kepone may be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight(7). Monitoring data indicate kepone residues can exist in soil for years after pesticidal applications(2,5). Kepone is a persistent organochlorine insecticide that still has an environmental impact decades after its ban(2).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.25X10-7 mm Hg(5), and water solubility of 2.7 mg/L(5). According to a classification scheme(6), a mean BCF range of 900-9,354(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). Biodegradation of kepone can occur, but it is a very slow environmental process(8). Little to no biodegradation was observed in studies using activated sludge(9),  contaminated hydrosoils(10), or exposure to sea water(11). A half-life of >312 days was measured using an estuarine sediment inoculum(12). Slow mineralization of kepone (3.2-4.9% CO2 evolution over 215 days of incubation) has been observed in aerobic soil studies(13). Kepone hydrates in aqueous solution to form the gem-diol kepone hydrate(14); the reaction is reversible(14).",

The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of kepone with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated as 0.0 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) using a structure estimation method(3) indicating it is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). However, kepone readily forms hydrates on exposure to ordinary temperatures and humidities(4). Vapor-phase kepone hydrate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 38 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.8X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase kepone may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Kepone and kepone hydrate are susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(5,6).",

Although experimental evidences of biodegradation of this compound are scarce, several dechlorination products have been proposed by Dolfing et al. (2012) using Gibbs free energy calculations to explore different potential transformation routes. We here present the results of an in silico classification (TyPol - Typology of Pollutants) of chlordecone transformation products (TPs) based on statistical analyses combining several environmental endpoints and structural molecular descriptors. Starting from the list of putative chlordecone TPs and considering available data on degradation routes of other organochlorine compounds, we used different clustering strategies to explore the potential environmental behaviour of putative chlordecone TPs from the knowledge on their molecular descriptors. The method offers the possibility to focus on TPs present in different classes and to infer their environmental fate. Thus, we have deduced some hypothetical trends for the environmental behaviour of TPs of chlordecone assuming that TPs, which were clustered away from chlordecone, would have different environmental fate and ecotoxicological impact compared to chlordecone. Our findings suggest that mono- and di-hydrochlordecone, which are TPs of chlordecone often found in contaminated soils, may have similar environmental behaviour in terms of persistence.",

Kepone readily forms hydrates on exposure to ordinary temperatures and humidities(2) and, in solution, kepone can exist in the carbonyl form and as its hydrate, a gem-diol(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of kepone hydrate with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated as 2.8X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) using a structure estimation method(1); this corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 38 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The direct photolysis of kepone may be possible in the environmental UV spectrum(4). A study found that photolysis of kepone in the presence of oxygen resulted in the formation of carbon dioxide and hydrogen chloride; however, no specific information concerning rates or amounts were provided(4). Irradiation of kepone dihydrate yielded the same photolysis products as irradiation of Mirex(5). The photolysis degradation products of kepone hydrate in solution were found to be monohydrokepone and dihydrokepone(3).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

BCF values of 1,100-2,200 were reported for fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas)(2) and a BCF of 8,400 was reported for fish (unnamed species)(3). According to a classification scheme(2), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Based on measured uptake and clearances rates, equilibrium BCFs were estimated for Brevoortia tyrannus (Atlantic menhaden), 2,300-9,750, and Menidia menidia (Atlantic silversides), 217,00-602,00(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Results were as follows: surface, 1 sample, 77 parts per trillion, 1.5-6 m depth, 8 samples, 63% positive, 46-579 parts per trillion, average of positive, 500 parts per trillion; centrifuged and filtered sediment supernatent, 902 ppm, surface water, 897 ppm(1). The Chesapeake Bay contained 0.04-0.08 ppm of kepone in 1976(2). A similar study found Lake Ontario and Lake St. Clair to contain undetermined amounts of kepone, while no kepone was detected in Lake Erie(3). Kepone was not detected in water samples collected from six sites around Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003 (detection limit not reported)(4).",

Kepone was used in banana plantations of the French West Indies to control the weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus(2); despite its prohibition in France in 1993, pollution surveys conducted in 2001 in the French West Indies by the French Department of Health revealed the presence of chlordecone in soils, rivers, springs and drinking water(2). Utilizing a dataset of 810 soil samples collected between 2006 and 2012 in Martinque (French West Indies where kepone had been extensively used in banana plantations in past years), kepone and 5b-hydro-kepone were commonly detected(3); comparison to insecticidal formulations suggested that 5b-hydro-kepone was a natural transformation product of kepone(3). Soil samples from the French West Indies showed kepone concentrations of 0.18 to 35.4 mg/kg in Andosol, Nitisol, Ferralsol, and Fluvisol soil types(4).",

Kepone was detected at concentrations of 0.06 and 0.08 ng/g wet wt in polychaetes and Mylio macrocephalus samples collected from sites around Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003(4); kepone was also detected in various fish species at concentrations of 0.53-3.21 ng/g wet wt(4).

Occupational exposure to kepone may occur through inhalation  and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where kepone was produced or used(1). However, occupational exposure to kepone should be low or non-existent(SRC) since kepone is no longer produced or used(2). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be, or was formerly exposed to kepone via ingestion of food, in particular fish and dairy products(3). Developing countries used kepone as a pesticide well after the cessation of use in the industrialized world (US, Japan and Western Europe) and the likelihood of exposure through dietary intake in these countries is considerably higher(3). Kepone exposure from drinking water has not been found to constitute significant human exposure since kepone is relatively insoluble in water and rapidly adsorbs to sediment(4). Kepone was used as insecticide in the French West Indies and was intensively applied to banana fields from 1973 to 1993 to control root borers(5); monitoring studies conducted from 1999 to present day (2015) have confirmed that the French West Indian population continues to be exposed to this chemical though consumption of contaminated foodstuffs(5).

It is based on: (1) the TF-IDF, adapted to chemical structures, (2) location information in the text (e.g. title, abstract, keywords), and (3) the document size.  Springer Nature aims to provide only highly qualitative and relevant content but references of lower relevance aren't withheld as they might contain also very useful information.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Based on the multistage process of carcinogenesis, data indicate that methyl groups and aromatic amines convert initiators into complete carcinogens. Experiments on rats with aromatic amines show that o-aminoazotoluene and 4-dimethylaminobenzene induce liver tumors. 4-Aminobenzene, considered a tumor initiator, also induces liver tumors in rats. The methyl groups are specifically active; 4-diethylaminobenzene is not carcinogenic whereas 4-dimethylaminobenzene is. Several studies with the aromatic hydrocarbons phenanthrene, chrysene, and benz(a)anthracene show them to be either noncarcinogenic, weakly carcinogenic, or tumor initiators. The methyl derivatives trimethylphenanthrene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylphenanthrene are weak but not positive skin carcinogens in mice. 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene is a very potent tumor promoter. Benzene rings also contribute to the carcinogenic process. It was concluded that in many cases the increase in carcinogenic activity after methyl groups are introduced into the molecule is due to tumor promoting rather than initiating activity.",

Carcinogens that are easily oxidizable can be destroyed with milder oxidative agents, such as saturated soln of potassium permanganate in acetone, which appears to be a suitable agent for destruction of hydrazines or of compounds containing isolated carbon-carbon double bonds. Concn or 50% aqueous sodium hypochlorite can also be used as an oxidizing agent. /Chemical Carcinogens/",

It may be released to the environment as a fugitive emission durining its production and use. If released to soil, 2-amino-5-azotoluene is expected to display only limited mobility. Its amino ground may bind covalently with active sites in soil further limiting its mobility. 2-Amino-5-azotoluene may only slowly volatilize from both moist and dry soils to the atmosphere. If released to water, 2-amino-5-azotoluene may bioconcentration in fish and aquatic organisms and it is expected to adsorb to sediment and suspended organic matter. 2-Amino-5-azotoluene is not expected to volatilize from water to the atmosphere. The estimated half-life for volatilization from a model river is 1888 days. 2-Amino-5-azotoluene absorbs UV light and it may undergo direct photochemical degradation in the upper layers of clear water. If released to the atmosphere, 2-amino-5-azotoluene may undergo a rapid gas-phase reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of 2.7 hrs. 2-Amino-5-azotoluene absorbs UV light indicating that it has the potential to undergo direct photochemical degradation in the atmosphere. Occupational exposure to 2-amino-5-azotoluene may occur by inhalation of dust and by dermal contact during its production, formulation and use. (SRC)",

Estimated soil adsorption coefficients ranging from 1426 to 3236(1-2,SRC) indicate that it may adsorb to sediment and suspended organic matter(SRC). Based on its estimated Henry's Law constant, 2.91X10-8 atm cu-m/mol at 25 \u00b0C(1-3,SRC), 2-amino-5-azotoluene is not expected to volatilize from water to the atmosphere. The estimated half-life for volatilization from a model river 1 m deep flowing at 1 m/sec and a wind speed of 3 m/sec is 1888 days(2,SRC). 2-Amino-5-azotoluene absorbs UV light with lambda max values at 326 nm and 490 nm in alcohol(4) which indicates that it has the potential to undergo direct photochemical degradation in the upper layers of clear water(4,SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Please note that obsolete codes are added in this classification for completeness purposes, as they are still in use. Any obsolete codes are annotated as such.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Their use as rodenticides is based on the inhibition of the vitamin K-dependent step in the synthesis of a number of blood coagulation factors. The vitamin K-dependent proteins ...in the coagulation cascade... are the procoagulant factors II (prothrombin), VII (proconvertin), IX (Christmas factor) and X (Stuart-Prower factor), and the coagulation-inhibiting proteins C and S. All these proteins are synthesized in the liver. Before they are released into the circulation the various precursor proteins undergo substantial (intracellular) post-translational modification. Vitamin K functions as a co-enzyme in one of these modifications, namely the carboxylation at well-defined positions of 10-12 glutamate residues into gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The presence of these Gla residues is essential for the procoagulant activity of the various coagulations factors. Vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) is the active co-enzyme, and its oxidation to vitamin K 2,3-epoxide (KO) provides the energy required for the carboxylation reaction. The epoxide is than recycled in two reduction steps mediated by the enzyme KO reductase... . The latter enzyme is the target enzyme for coumarin anticoagulants. Their blocking of the KO reductase leads to a rapid exhaustion of the supply of KH2, and thus to an effective prevention of the formation of Gla residues. This leads to an accumulation of non-carboxylated coagulation factor precursors in the liver. In some cases these precursors are processed further without being carboxylated, and (depending on the species) may appear in the circulation. At that stage the under-carboxylated proteins are designated as descarboxy coagulation factors. Normal coagulation factors circulate in the form of zymogens, which can only participate in the coagulation cascade after being activated by limited proteolytic degradation. Descarboxy coagulation factors have no procoagulant activity (i.e. they cannot be activated) and neither they can be converted into the active zymogens by vitamin K action. Whereas in anticoagulated humans high levels of circulating descarboxy coagulation factors are detectable, these levels are negligible in warfarin-treated rats and mice. /Anticoagulant rodenticides/",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

Flammable hydrogen is generated by mixing esters with alkali metals and hydrides. This chemical may hydrolyze under alkaline or acidic conditions. (NTP, 1992)",

CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2 yr gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule adenomas and focal hyperplasia. The transitional cell carcinomas in two 600 mg/kg males may also have been chemical related. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in female F344/N rats receiving 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in male B6C3FI mice receiving 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg.

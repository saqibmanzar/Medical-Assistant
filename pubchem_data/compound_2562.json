When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Protective effects against maximal electroshock-induced seizures in a dose-related fashion was also observed following either intraperitoneal or oral administration. In hERG-transfected cells, pentoxyverine inhibited the outward current of the hERG ion channel with half-maximal inhibition concentrations (IC50) of 3.0 \u00b5M. In rats receiving intrathecal administration, pentoxyverine exhibited dose-dependent spinal blockade with a more sensory-selective action over motor blockade. It induced a spinal blockade with a more sensory/nociceptive-selective action over motor blockade compared to lidocaine.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Pentoxyverine acts as an agonist at sigma receptors with the Ki of 75\u00b128 nM, as demonstrated in a competitive binding assay. The function of sigma receptors on cough suppressant activities is unclear, however these receptors are highly expressed in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of the brainstem where the afferent fibres first synapse. NTS is located very close to the cough centre in the brainstem thus may function as a \u2018gate' for the cough reflex and allow sigma-1 receptor agonists to modulate afferent activity prior to reaching the cough center. It is suggested that highly lipophilic sigma-1 agonists may penetrate the CNS following systemic administration. When administered as aerosols, sigma-1 receptor agonists may temporarily act in the periphery to modulate cough by acting activate sigma receptors expressed in the lungs. However there is limited evidence of peripheral localization of the sigma agonists following aerosol administration and the ruling out of systemic exposure. The local anesthesia action of pentoxyverine may occur through inhibition of voltage-gated Na(+) currents.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

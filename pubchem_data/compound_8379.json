PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The reaction generally starts at elevated temperatures and proceeds exothermically. The second step is the conversion of the monoester to a diester with the formation of water. This is a reversible reaction and proceeds more slowly than the first, thus determining the overall rate of reaction. To shift the equilibrium towards the diester, the water of reaction is removed by distillation. The rate of reaction can be influenced by the choice of catalyst and the reaction temperature. For fast conversion rates, high reaction temperatures are generally used. However, these are influenced by the boiling point of the alcohol and/or the type of catalyst. ... Currently, nearly all major phthalate producers use amphoteric catalysts for the esterification of high boiling alcohols. ... The reaction temperatures for the amphoteric catalysts are about 200 \u00b0C. At this temperature side reactions are minimized, and the alcohol can be recycled without purification. By using this type of catalyst, over 99.5 % conversion to diester can be achieved. /Phthalates/",

Males (13/group) were exposed to ditridecyl phthalate for 42 days. Females (13/group) were exposed to ditridecyl phthalate from 14 days prior to mating to day 3 of lactation. No deaths were observed. Increased salivation was transiently observed in male animals of the 50 and 250 mg/kg groups after the day 10 of treatment until the autopsy. No adverse effects were detected on food consumption in males and females of any group, whereas suppression of body weight gain was observed in females of the 50 and 250 mg/kg groups. No adverse effects of ditridecyl phthalate were found on the general condition in females and on body weight gain in males. Increase in liver weight was observed in males of the 250 mg/kg group and in females of the 50 and 250 mg/kg groups. On histopathological examination of liver, hypertrophy of the centrilobular hepatocytes was observed in males and females of the 50 and 250 mg/kg groups, and catalase positive granules in centrilobular hepatocytes were increased in males, as well. An increase in kidney weight was found in males of the 250 mg/kg group. On histopathological examination, eosinophilic bodies in renal tubular cells were increased in males of the 250 mg/kg group. In addition, basophilic tubules in the cortex which appeared to be regeneration foci resulting from necrosis of renal tubular epithelium were observed in this group. Hyperplasia of the pelvic epithelium and transitional cells of the urinary bladder was found in females of the 250 mg/kg group, while ditridecyl phthalate did not affect kidney weight in females. On urinary testing and hematological examination, no adverse effects of ditridecyl phthalate were noted. On blood chemical examination in males, ALP activity was found to be increased after the treatment of ditridecyl phthalate at 250 mg/kg.",

Males were administered for 42 days and females to day 3 of lactation. ... No adverse effects were observed on copulation, fertility, maintenance of pregnancy, and delivery in any groups. A statistically significant decrease in live birth index on postnatal day (PND) 0, possibly due to poor lactation, was observed in the 250 mg/kg group (87.7 in high dose vs 99.6 in controls). Viability of neonates on PND 4 was slightly decreased (not statistically significant) in the 250 mg/kg group (89.9 in the high dose vs 96.8 in controls). However, there were no adverse effects of ditridecyl phthalate on sex ratio, body weight changes, and morphological appearance of pups. NOELs for reproductive and developmental toxicity are considered to be 250 mg/kg/day in males, 50 mg/kg/day in females, and 250 mg/kg/day in pups, respectively. ... Maternal effects included mild suppression of body weight gain (<10% decrease) and increased liver:body weight ratios in females of the 50 and 250 mg/kg groups. Other than slight liver hypertrophy, there were no adverse histopathologic findings in tissues of female rats. In addition, no adverse effects were observed on copulation, fertility, maintenance of pregnancy, and delivery in any groups. The NOEL for maternal effects was 10 mg/kg/day. /Purity: 93.7-100%/",

For the lower-molecular-weight phthalate esters - dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) - the results of the studies indicated a general trend in which toxicity for both species increased as water solubility decreased. The geometric mean maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (GM-MATC) for D. magna ranged from 0.63 to 34.7 mg/L. For the higher-molecular-weight phthalate esters - dihexyl phthalate (DHP), butyl 2-ethylhexyl phthalate (BOP), di-(n-hexyl, n-octyl, n-decyl) phthalate (610P), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisooctyl phthalate (DIOP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), di-(heptyl, nonyl, undecyl) phthalate (711P), diisodecyl phthalate (DIOP), diundecyl phthalate (DUP), and ditridecyl phthalate (DTDP) - the GM-MATC values ranged from 0.042 to 0.15 mg/L. Survival was equally sensitive and sometimes more sensitive than reproduction. The observed toxicity to daphnids with most of the higher-molecular-weight phthalate esters appeared to be due to surface entrapment or a mode of toxicity that is not due to exposure to dissolved aqueous-phase chemical. Early life-stage toxicity studies with rainbow trout indicated that survival (DMP) and growth (DBP) were affected at 24 and 0.19 mg/L, respectively.",

Ditridecyl phthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ditridecyl phthalate is expected to have no mobility based upon an average Koc of 1.2X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Using an inoculum obtained from soil and sewage sludge, ditridecyl phthalate underwent >50% primary biodegradation under aerobic conditions in 28 days, and 37% mineralization to carbon dioxide during the same time period. If released into water, ditridecyl phthalate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Ditridecyl phthalate underwent 51.5% biodegradation in a semi-continuous activated sludge test under aerobic conditions in 24 hrs, and complete degradation was observed in 12 days in an activated sludge die-away test under aerobic conditions. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 hours and 12 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 5600 years when adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 7.7 years and 280 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to ditridecyl phthalate may occur through inhalation of aerosols and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ditridecyl phthalate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed via inhalation of particultes and dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

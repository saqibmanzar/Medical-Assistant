Male Wistar rats were induced with clofibrate, nafenopin, phenobarbital, or beta-naphthoflavone prior to liver microsomal isolation. ... Both purified NADPH cytochrome p450 reductase and the reconstituted system reduced dimethylaminoazobenzene, with a more than five fold greater rate for the latter. A ratio of 2:1 azoreductase to cytochrome p450 was optimal for dimethylaminoazobenzene reduction. Clofibrate was the only inducer of azoreductase. Reaction with the suicide inhibitor 10-undecynoic acid distinguished laurate hydroxylase from the azoreductase. The reconstituted system was active in air and carbon monoxide, while purified NADPH cytochrome p450 reductase was inhibited in air. In both systems, nearly 50 fold acceleration of dimethylaminoazobenzene azoreduction occurred in the presence of flavin adenine dinucleotide or flavin mononucleotide, but only under anaerobic conditions, indicating facilitation of electron flow to dimethylaminoazobenzene onlhy from NADPH cytochrome p450-reductase and not from cytochrome p450 itself. This was confirmed with the use of cytochrome p450 inhibitors. ... There appears to be an obilgatory electron flow through cytochrome p450 to dimethylaminozaobenzene, bypassing an oxygen sensitive step, and dietary riboflavin probably attenuates dimethylaminoazobenzene hepatocarcinogenicity solely by its effect on intestinal bacteria.",

Because of its characteristic color change as a function of pH, it was the first carcinogen that demonstrated binding to cellular macromolecules. Because of the flavin-dependent azo dye reductase, it was also one of the first carcinogens with a clear-cut nutritional modulation of its activity. Substitution with polar groups such as sulfonic acid in simple azo dyes usually abolishes carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. Thus, molecules such as FD and C Red No. 2 (amaranth) are not mutagenic or carcinogenic. On the other hand, tetra-azo dyes such as direct black 38 or direct blue 6, which are not mutagenic and are quite polar, can release the mutagenic carcinogenic benzidine upon reduction of the azo link by bacteria. Such dyes are highly carcinogenic.",

If it is released to soil it may bind to the soil based on an estimated Koc of 7390 and therefore should not leach to the groundwater. However, since it has a pKa of 3.226 at 25 \u00b0C, it exists partially as a cation and the extent of its adsorption to soils and sediments should be affected by the pH of the medium. It should not hydrolyze in soils. No information was found on its biodegradation in soils. If it is released to water it may bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms, adsorb to sediment, and may be subject to direct photolysis. It should not hydrolyze or evaporate from water. Based on a laboratory screening test using an inoculum from settled domestic wastewater, it may be subject to biodegradation. If it is released to the atmosphere, it may be subject to direct photolysis and the estimated vapor phase half-life in the atmosphere is 7.04 hr as a result of photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals adding to the aromatic rings; however, it may exist primarily adsorbed onto particulate matter due to its very low vapor pressure. Exposure may occur as a result of occupational dermal exposure. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

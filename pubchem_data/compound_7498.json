Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, oral, dermal, inhalation), exposure to benzyl bromide may occur environmentally from inhaling air contaminated by exhaust from automobiles using leaded gasoline, or occupationally from its use in research. This colorless to slightly yellow liquid is an intense irritant to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes; and, in large doses, can cause CNS depression. Local exhaust ventilation should be applied wherever there is an incidence of point source emissions or dispersion of the pungent smelling, benzyl bromide. If contact is anticipated (eg, if handling broken benzyl bromide containers), wear a self-contained breathing apparatus, goggles, rubber gloves, and full protective clothing. Any material which contacts the body must be washed away with copious amounts of water. Benzyl bromide does not ignite readily, and burns only with great difficulty. However, when strongly heated, it emits highly toxic fumes and gases. Fire fighters should wear a positive-pressure breathing apparatus and protective clothing, and extinguish benzyl bromide fires with alcohol foam, CO2, or dry chemical agents. Water also may be used particularly in flooding quantities as a spray or fog (solid streams may be ineffective), to reduce vapor and to cool containers. However, care must be taken because benzyl bromide may react with water to form hydrogen bromide gas. Because runoff from fire control water may be toxic or corrosive, it should be diked or otherwise contained. Store benzyl bromide in cool, well-ventilated areas, out of the sun, and away from potential fire hazard and combustibles (wood, paper, oil, etc). It is also important that the location be dry, because benzyl bromide will react slowly with water to generate hydrogen bromide. Packaging materials are limited by the fact benzyl bromide is corrosive to metal (it decomposes rapidly in the presence of all common metals except nickel and lead; liberating heat and hydrogen bromide). Containers of benzyl bromide may be shipped by air, rail, road, or water, and should be affixed with labels stating, \"Poison and Corrosive\". Regulatory requirements of the DOT should be consulted before transport. For all benzyl bromide spills, water spray may be needed to knock down vapor. Small spills of benzyl bromide should be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed in containers for later disposal. Large land spills should be deposited in excavated pits, ponds, or other holding areas (fitted with impermeable flexible membrane liners, if possible) for later disposal. Any surface flow should be diked with soil or sand bags, and a \"universal\" gelling agent applied to immobilize the spill. For water spills, trap the substance at the bottom with sand bag barriers and remove with suction hoses, or apply activated carbon and remove immobilized masses of pollutants and precipitates with mechanical dredges of lifts. Prior to implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The earliest chemical attack occurred on the Western Front in October 1914 in Neuve Chapelle, but its effects were so minimal that the Allies learned about it only after the war from German documents. The attack in the area Bolimow, made by the Germans against the Russian army with artillery shells containing gas T (xylyl and benzyl bromides), was therefore the first attack on a massive scale recorded on the victim side. The attack, which occurred after it made it possible to obtain some tactical success, but without a strategic breakthrough. Some of the later German attacks on the eastern front where chlorine was used proved to be more effective, but despite the many victims there was not any major strategic success achieved. The Russians did not take attempts to use chemical weapons in the First World War.",

It is miscible in ethanol and ether, and soluble in carbon tetrachloride, benzene, and water. It is used as a chemical intermediate for foaming and frothing agents and other organic chemicals. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Liquid benzyl bromide can burn the eyes; skin contact causes irritation. Inhalation causes irritation of nose and throat; severe exposure may cause pulmonary edema. It is intensely corrosive to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Occupational exposure to this chemical may occur through inhalation, and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is produced or used. Monitoring data indicated that the general population may have been exposed to benzyl bromide by inhalation of automobile exhaust from vehicles using leaded gasoline. ANIMAL STUDIES: Benzyl bromide was inactive as a carcinogen at doses in rats. Benzyl bromide was negative for mutagenic results in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100 . This chemical was used to study chemical reactivity with 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)pyridine, and guanosine in vitro, in relation to mutagenic potency in Salmonella typhimurium and sister chromatid exchange induction in Chinese hamster cells. Benzyl bromide was found to be reactive, causing base-pair mutations in Salmonella typhimurium and also inducing sister chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster cells.",

These free radicals are also potent oxidizers and produce tissue damage. In additon, the formation of hydrobromic and bromic acids will result in secondary irritation.

This is believed to be a result of bromide ions substituting for chloride ions in the in actions of neurotransmitters and transport systems, thus affecting numerous synaptic processes.

Its former use in leaded gasoline resulted in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.45 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzyl bromide will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzyl bromide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 days. Benzyl bromide at low concentration (59.4 mg/L) does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm but does at high concentration (297 mg/L); therefore, it is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzyl bromide is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 340. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.9X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, due to a chemical hydrolysis half-life of 79 minutes for benzyl bromide, adsorption, volatilization, bioconcentration, and biodegradation are not expected to be important environmental fate processes in moist soil. Benzyl bromide may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, benzyl bromide is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hrs and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 49 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. However, due to a chemical hydrolysis half-life of 79 minutes for benzyl bromide, adsorption, volatilization, bioconcentration, and biodegradation are not expected to be important environmental fate processes in water. Occupational exposure to benzyl bromide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzyl bromide is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicated that the general population may have been exposed to benzyl bromide via inhalation of automobile exhaust from vehicles using leaded gasoline. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.9X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hrs and 6 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(67), an estimated BCF of 39(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). However, due to a calculated half-life of 79 minutes for benzyl bromide(7), adsorption, volatilization, bioconcentration, and biodegradation are not expected to be important environmental fate processes in water(SRC). Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2014).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 7 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for chemical hydrolysis of benzyl bromide at 25 \u00b0C was estimated to be 1.45X10-4 sec-1 based on an experimentally derived rate constant of 2.75X10-4 sec-1 at 30 \u00b0C(2,3). Using these data, the half-life for chemical hydrolysis of benzyl bromide at 25 \u00b0C has been estimated to be 79 minutes(2). At a relatively low concentration (59.4 mg/L) benzyl bromide in methanol exhibits almost no absorption of UV light at wavelengths >290 nm; at a relatively high concentration (297 mg/L), benzyl bromide in methanol exhibits fairly strong absorption of UV light wavelengths >290 nm(4). Therefore, benzyl bromide is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.

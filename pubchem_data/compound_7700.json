When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Six of the 12 patients were retested several months later, and each of the six had a sensitization reaction to 2% aqueous Nonoxynol-6, -83, -9, -10, -14, and - 18. Photosensitization reactions to diluted Nonoxynol-10 (concentrations up to 2% aqueous), but not to undiluted Nonoxynol-10, were reported in two patients who had been treated with an antiseptic preparation that contained Nonoxynol-10. Follow-up studies on 32 control subjects who had never used this antiseptic preparation showed an inconsistent pattern of reactions. Allergic reactions to Nonoxynol-6 were noted in two case reports.

Emulgen 913 and SDS administration increased the level of cholesterol esters and phospholipids, respectively. But Emulgen 913 administration reduced the level of triglycerides in the serum, and SDS administration reduced also the levels of triglycerides and cholesterol esters. In spite of the changes in serum lipid composition, the administration of these detergents did not affect the amount of total lipids in rat serum. The proportion of palmitic, oleic, and docosahexaenoic acids in phospholipids was decreased by the administration of Emulgen 913 while the level of arachidonic acid was raised. ...Both Emulgen 913 and SDS administration showed an effect on the fatty acid composition of triglycerides.",

The commercial product has a variety of ethoxylate functional groups; estimated physical properties where based upon 5 ethoxylates. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.7X10-13 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates nonoxynol will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase onoxynol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Nonoxynol absorbs at wavelengths of 275 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, nonoxynol is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-17 atm-cu m/mole. Nonoxynol will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 3 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, nonoxynol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF range of 7.6-16 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to nonoxynol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where nonoxynol is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to nonoxynol via dermal contact with contaminated water and consumer products containing nonoxynol. (SRC)",

Half-lives were estimated to range from 23-69 days under winter conditions (13 \u00b0C) and 2.5-25 days under summer conditions (22.5 \u00b0C)(1). Laboratory biodegradation experiments using filtered and nonoxylnol spiked river water from Tokyo, Japan suggested that cleavage of the ethylene oxide chain was due to bacterial action, rather than photolysis(2). In addition, in the early stages of bacterial cleavage, terminal ethylene oxide units with lengths longer than 9 were preferentially cleaved(2). Degradation of a branched derivative of nonoxylol was studied using bench-scale activated sludge units treating a synthetic sewage feed(3). The branched derivative of nonoxylol was degraded at influent doses of 10-40 mg/L; substantial BOD breakthrough, loss of nitrification, aerator foaming, and incomplete removal of the branched nonoxylol derivative occurred when dosed at 80 and 100 mg/L(3). Nonoxylol was found to biodegrade within 3 days in a river die-away test to give the homologue with 2 ethyleneoxide units; further biodegradation was considerably slower(4). Nonoxynol, present at 30 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 3 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

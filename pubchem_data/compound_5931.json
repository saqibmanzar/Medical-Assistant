When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Exposure to this colorless crystalline substance may occur through dermal contact or inhalation at sites where it is commercially produced or used. Exposure to N-methyl-4-aminophenol may cause eye and skin irritation, including a persistent allergic dermatitis. In case of contact, immediately flush skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Contaminated clothing and shoes should be removed and isolated at the site. When engaged in emergency activities involving N-methyl-4-aminophenol, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and chemical protective clothing specifically recommended by the shipper or producer. N-methyl-4-aminophenol does not ignite easily, however, it may burn producing irritating or poisonous gases. Also, containers of the substance may explode in the heat of a fire. For small fires involving N-methyl-4-aminophenol, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, fog, or standard foam. Dike runoff from fire control water because it may give off poisonous gases and cause pollution. N-methyl-4-aminophenol may be shipped via air, rail, road, and water, in containers bearing the label, \"Keep away from food.\" Prior to implementing permanent land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

The investigation was carried out in 5 stages. (I) Questionnaire (II) Clinical examination and interview with all employees who stated that they had had skin disease at some time (III) Patch testing at the laboratory of all cases of suspected occupational dermatoses, and control tests in hospital of 200 non-exposed eczema patients (IV) Investigation of protective gloves by patch testing and in a chemical bath (V) Allergy test on guinea pigs (GPMT) of one agent (PBA-1). The firm had 114 employees and the questionnaire was answered by 103. Altogether 43 persons at some time had been exposed to chemicals in their work, and 21 of them had had occupational dermatoses. In 12 cases, contact allergy was found to one or more of the photographic chemicals CD-2, CD-3, Metol and PBA-1. GPMT with PBA-1 showed it to be a potent sensitizer. The color developing agents may also give rise to lichenoid reactions and 2 such cases were seen in this investigation. Other causes of occupational dermatoses are indicated, as well as the occurrence of non-occupational skin diseases.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.1X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates N-methyl-4-aminophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase N-methyl-4-aminophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.9 hours. N-Methyl-4-aminophenol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight; typical half-lives for hydroxyl radical and peroxy radical reactions are on the order of 19-30 sunlight hours. If released to soil, N-methyl-4-aminophenol is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 110. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. N-Methyl-4-aminophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, N-methyl-4-aminophenol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Aromatic amines in the water column may be susceptible to photooxidation. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to N-methyl-4-aminophenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N-methyl-4-aminophenol is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

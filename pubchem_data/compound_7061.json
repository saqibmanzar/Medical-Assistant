PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.14 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates N,N-diethylaniline will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase N,N-diethylaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours. Direct photolysis may also occur since N,N-diethylaniline absorbs light greater than 290 nm, but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown. If released to soil, N,N-diethylaniline is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,500. A pKa value of 6.57 suggests that N,N-diethylaniline will exist partially in the protonated form in aqueous environments and the protonated form of N,N-diethylaniline is expected to bind strongly to soil surfaces. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process for the neutral species based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. N,N-Diethylaniline is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. N,N-Diethylaniline is expected to biodegrade slowly in the environment, based upon a number of aquatic aerobic biodegradation studies where 0% theoretical BOD was observed. If released into water, N,N-diethylaniline is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process for the neutral species based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 6.5 days, respectively. Measured BCF values in the range of 17-161 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to high. Occupational exposure to N,N-diethylaniline may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N,N-diethylaniline is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure of 0.14 mm Hg(4) and water solubility of 139 mg/l(5) at 25 \u00b0C. Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 6.5 days, respectively(SRC). A pKa of 6.57(6) suggests that N,N-diethylaniline will exist partially in the protonated form in aqueous environments and the protonated form of N,N-diethylaniline is not expected to volatilize from water. According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values of 17-161 measured in carp(8) suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to high. N,N-Diethylaniline achieved 0% of the theoretical BOD in a sewage sludge during a 5 day incubation period and was considered persistent(9). Using the Japanese MITI test, N,N-diethylaniline achieved 0% of theoretical BOD in an acclimated study during a 4 week incubation(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that N,N-diethylaniline is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 6.5 days(SRC). N,N-Diethylaniline's Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). N,N-Diethylaniline is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1). A pKa value of 6.57(4), suggests that N,N-diethylaniline will exist partially in the protonated form in aqueous environments and the protonated form of N,N-diethylaniline is not expected to volatilize from water or moist soil surfaces(SRC).",

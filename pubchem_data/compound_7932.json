When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Severe headache, nausea, sometimes vomiting, dryness of throat.  Central nervous symptoms: confusion, ataxia, vertigo, tinnitus, weakness, disorientation, lethargy, drowsiness, and finally coma. Convulsions may occur but appear to be uncommon.  Cardiac effects: heart blocks, arrhythmias, and shock.  Death, although uncommon, is usually due to cardiovascular collapse and not resp paralysis.  Urinary signs and symptoms may incl painful micturition, hematuria, hemoglobinuria, and renal insufficiency (usually mild).  A late acute hemolytic episode should be anticipated at 6 to 8 days after ingestion. /Aniline/",

Liver function and tissue morphology also were determined at 24 or 48 hr. None of the CAA were marked nephrotoxicants at doses of 0.5 or 1.0 mmol/kg. However, 4-CAA (1.5 mmol/kg) induced an increase in blood urea nitrogen concentration and kidney weight at 24 hr and 3-CAA (1.5 mmol/kg) was lethal within 24 hr. The decreasing order of in vivo nephrotoxic potential was found to be 4-CAA > or = 3-CAA > 2-CAA.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.066 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-chloroaniline will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-chloroaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5.1 hours. 3-Chloroaniline absorbs light with wavelengths >290 nm and may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-chloroaniline is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 250. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. 3-Chloroaniline may undergo covalent chemical bonding with humic materials which results in its chemical alteration and tight adsorption. There is evidence to suggest that this complexing may extend the residual life of these substances in soil for as much as 10 years. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil may attenuate volatilization. The pKa of 3-chloroaniline is 3.52, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in its nonionic form in the environment. 3-Chloroaniline is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. When 3-chloroaniline (30 ppm) was incubated in Guelph loam with water added to 60% water-holding capacity, levels declined rapidly for 2 weeks after which time the rate of loss decreased. The percent of 3-chlororaniline remaining in soil after 2 and 8 weeks were 38% and 18%, respectively. If released into water, 3-chloroaniline may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. In addition, 3-chloroaniline may undergo chemical bonding with humic materials in the water column and in the sediment. In 3-day cultivation tests using 2 different river waters from Japan and two different sea waters, 50% of initial 3-chloroaniline was degraded; the degradation was paralleled by growth of microbes. A biotransformation half-life of 0.4 year was determined for 3-chloroaniline in laboratory studies using two pond and one river water samples obtained near Athens, GA. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 42 and 310 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. Measured BCF values ranging from 0.8 to 11.5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Irradiation of an aqueous solution of 3-chloroaniline in a quartz tube with a fluorochemical lamp (wavelengths above 300 nm) resulted in a photodegradation half-life of 2.6 hours. Occupational exposure to 3-chloroaniline may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-chloroaniline is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 3-chloroaniline via ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). 3-Chloroaniline may undergo covalent chemical bonding with humic materials which results in its chemical alteration and tight adsorption(6). There is evidence to suggest that this complexing may extend the residual life of these substances in soil for as much as 10 years(7). Due to this covalent bonding, significant leaching in soil systems is not generally expected to occur(SRC). The pKa of 3-chloroaniline is 3.52(10), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in its nonionic form in the environment. Volatilization of 3-chloroaniline from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(8). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). 3-Chloroaniline is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.066 mm Hg(9). 3-Chloroaniline may degrade in soil by chemical and microbial processes(11). When 3-chloroaniline (30 ppm) was incubated in Guelph loam with water added to 60% water-holding capacity, levels declined rapidly for 2 weeks after which time the rate of loss decreased(11). The percent of 3-chlororaniline remaining in soil after 2 and 8 weeks were 38% and 18%, respectively(11).",

In addition, 3-chloroaniline may undergo chemical bonding with humic materials in the water column and in the sediment(4). Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 42 and 310 days, respectively(SRC). However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(13,14), and volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The pKa of 3-chloroaniline is 3.52(6), indicating that this compound will primarily exist in its nonionic form in the environment. According to a classification scheme(7), measured BCF values ranging from 0.8 to 11.5(8,9) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). In a 3-day cultivation test using 2 different river waters from Japan and two different sea waters, 50% of initial 3-chloroaniline was degraded; the degradation was paralleled by growth of microbes(9,10). A biotransformation half-life of 0.4 year was determined for 3-chloroaniline in laboratory studies using two pond and one river water samples obtained near Athens, GA(12). Irradiation of an aqueous solution of 3-chloroaniline in a quartz tube with a fluorochemical lamp (wavelengths above 300 nm) resulted in a photodegradation half-life of 2.6 hours(14).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

A 100% loss of UV absorbance of 3-chloroaniline in a mineral salts solution, with a soil inoculum, required an excess of 64 days(2). Using an acclimated activated sludge inoculum, 97.2% of initial 3-chloroaniline was degraded under the test conditions(3). Biological transformation (20% degradation in 6 hr) was observed in an aqueous test system receiving activated sludge from two treatment plants(4). In the Zahn-Wellens test, 100% DOC removal was obtained in 17 days(7). Incubation of 3-chloroaniline (50 mg/50 g soil) in soil for 14 days resulted in formation of 3,3'-dichloroazobenzene(5). No dichloroazobenzene was formed using sterilized soil(5). 3-Chloroaniline was degraded (85-90%) with no lag period by a  mixed culture of containing Pseudomonas (12 species) and Bacillus (15 species), which was isolated from sludge that was acclimated to nitroaniline(6). 3-Chloroaniline may degrade in soil by chemical and microbial processes(8). When 3-chloroaniline (30 ppm) was incubated in Guelph loam with water added to 60% water-holding capacity, levels declined rapidly for 2 weeks after which time the rate of loss decreased(8). The percent of 3-chlororaniline remaining in soil after 2 and 8 weeks were 38% and 18%, respectively(8).",

On this basis, 3-chloroaniline was judged to be readily biodegradable(4). A biotransformation half-life of 0.4 year was determined for 3-chloroaniline in laboratory studies using two pond and one river water samples obtained near Athens, GA(2). The primary biotransformation product is 4-chlorocatechol(2). In laboratory studies examining the persistence of 3-chloroaniline in water, no significant difference was observed in the degradation rate in pond water, pond water plus sewage sludge inocula, or sterile water over a 14 day period(3). This suggests that degradation is mostly chemical in nature(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5.1 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 3-Chloroaniline is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(2). 3-Chloroaniline absorbs light with wavelengths >290 nm(3) and may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Irradiation of an aqueous solution of 3-chloroaniline in a quartz tube with a fluorochemical lamp (wavelengths above 300 nm) resulted in a photodegradation half-life of 2.6 hours(4). The quantum yield was measured to be 0.0429 at 292 nm in hexane solution with photodegradation to aniline(5). In another study in which 3-chloroaniline in water was irradiated in a photoreactor with a light source with radiation in the 250-300 nm region (Integrated intensity times extinction coefficient = 3512 L/mol-cm, 20 \u00b0C), the photohydrolysis rate constant and half-life was 0.393/min and 1.76 min respectively(6).

Excretion was rapid with depuration rates and half-lives of 0.21/hr and 3.3 hr, respectively(1). This conclusion is supported by field data in which the concentration of 3-chloroaniline in water and fish were <0.02 - 0.02 ug/L and <2.0 ng/g(1). Uptake was rapid in static tests (0.17 umol/L, 26 \u00b0C) on zebrafish and a BCF of 11.5 was obtained for 100 hr exposure (2). Elimination was best described by a two compartment first order model(2). After 52 hr of depuration, the concn of 3-chloroaniline in the zebrafish declined to 10.3% of the steady state value.  According to a classification scheme(3), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc value suggests that 3-chloroaniline is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). In laboratory persistence studies using non-sterilized Hagerstown silty clay loam soil, 73% of applied 3-chloroaniline remained chemically bound to soil particles after 64 days of incubation(6). A related chemical, 2-chloroaniline, has been observed to undergo rapid and reversible covalent bonding with humic materials in aqueous solution; the initial bonding reaction is followed by a slower and much less reversible reaction believed to represent the addition of the amine to quinoidal structures followed by oxidation of the product to give an amino-substituted quinone(7).",

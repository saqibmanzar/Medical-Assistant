When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

(1) The air sampler contains 350 mg of silica gel coated with 1 mg of acidified 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH). Air sampling may be conducted at 0.03 to 1.0 L/min for periods up to 8 hr. Samples were eluted with ethyl acetate, and the eluents were allowed to stand for 72 hr. Analysis was by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a UV detector set at 369 nm. An unusual phenomenon was the observation that the stability of the sample on a sampler at 3 degrees C tends to decrease as the total quantity of OPA collected on the sampler decreases. Elution of the samples within 24 hr of air sampling is required. The detection limit (LOD) is approximately 0.02 ug of OPA per sample. OPA on surfaces may be collected with strips cut from a sheet of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA wipe). (2) In the surface wipe method with analysis by fluorescence measurement, the strips of PVA wipe were placed into dimethyl sulfoxide. An aliquot was treated with aqueous N-acetyl-l-cysteine and ethylenediamine. Analysis was performed with a portable fluorometer (excitation and emission wavelengths = 365 nm and 438 nm, respectively). The LOD is 0.2 ug per sample. (3) In the surface wipe method with visual colorimetric detection, the strips of PVA wipe were placed into 30:70 acetonitrile:water. An aliquot was treated with N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine in 0.1 m sulfuric acid. After color development, the LOD is approximately 48 ug per sample. These methods have been field tested in a hospital.",

These methods are based on the derivatization of OPA with hydrazine in water. The following optimum reaction conditions were established: reagent dosage, 20 mg/mL of hydrazine; pH 2; reaction for 20 min at 70 \u00b0C. The organic derivative was detected directly by HPLC or after the extraction with methylene chloride/concentration by GC-MS. The limit of detection of OPA in water was 4.0 and 0.3 ug/L by HPLC and GC-MS, respectively. The calibration curve showed good linearity with r2 = 0.9993 and r2 = 0.9994 by HPLC and GC-MS, respectively, the accuracy was in a range of 95-105%, and the precision of the assay was less than 13% in water. The HPLC method was simple and reproducible enough to permit the OPA content analysis in the disinfectant products, and the GC-MS method is sensitive enough to permit reliable analysis of OPA to the ug/L level in environmental water.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

HUMAN STUDIES: OPA is a commonly used solution for rapid sterilization of medical equipment. Cases of anaphylaxis following cystoscopy with endoscopes sterilized with this agent have been reported. OPA-induced anaphylaxis following laryngoscopy have also been described. In these patients, OPA-specific IgE was detected in the serum. Contact dermatitis occurred in 4 workers of the endoscopy unit, one of whom also developed asthma. Among 80 female disinfection workers who used only antiseptic solutions containing OPA, the incidence of disinfection-related complaints were 10% skin, 9% eye, and 16% respiratory symptoms. ANIMAL STUDIES: In male mice, injected OPA induced specific IgE and IgG in the sera, suggesting that OPA acts as a hapten. Overall, OPA caused acute inflammation and acted as a haptenic allergen, although it caused only mild liver injury. In mice sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA), OPA enhanced the OVA-induced recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and the production of allergen-specific IgE, suggesting that OPA acts as an immunological adjuvant. The major targets from OPA exposure in rats and mice included the respiratory system (nasal cavity, larynx, trachea, and lung), skin, eye, testis, and epididymis. The most sensitive measure of OPA inhalation toxicity in male and female rats and mice was significantly increased incidences of nasal cavity lesions (lowest-observable-effect concentration = 0.44 ppm). OPA was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation; no mutagenicity was seen in TA100 with metabolic activation or in TA98 or Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA/pKM101, with or without metabolic activation.",

We report two cases of anaphylaxis following cystoscopy with endoscopes sterilized with this agent. Only a handful of such reactions have been reported in the published literature, the majority of which are in the bladder cancer population undergoing surveillance cystoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical presentation of two cases of anaphylaxis following flexible cystoscopy with instruments sterilized with ortho-phthalaldehyde. We further describe their subsequent evaluation by an allergy and immunology specialist who performed skin testing to confirm a suspected ortho-phthalaldehyde allergy. RESULTS: Both patients were skin test positive to ortho-phthalaldehyde antigen. As a result, sterilization techniques for our flexible endoscopes has been altered. To date, no further anaphylactic reactions have occurred in our bladder cancer patients, including the two cases presented herein following subsequent cystoscopic evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: Ortho-phthalaldehyde-sterilized cystoscopes have been associated with anaphylactic reactions in a small number of patients who have undergone repeated cystoscopy. The manufacturer has already made recommendations to avoid this agent in bladder cancer patients. It may be prudent to extend this practice to other populations undergoing repeat cystoscopy.",

In all three cases, the basophil histamine release test was useful for identifying the allergen as OPA. OPA-specific IgE was successfully detected in the serum of the patients by ELISA. DISCUSSION: Physicians and co-medical workers need to be aware of potential allergens to which patients may be exposed during routine medical procedures.",

The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the irritancy and sensitization potential of OPA. The EpiDerm Skin Irritation Test was used to evaluate in vitro irritancy potential of OPA and glutaraldehyde. Treatment with 0.4125 and 0.55% OPA induced irritation, while glutaraldehyde exposure at these concentrations did not. Consistent with the in vitro results, OPA induced irritancy, evaluated by ear swelling, when mice were treated with 0.75%. Initial evaluation of the sensitization potential was conducted using the local lymph node assay at concentrations ranging from 0.005 to 0.75%. A concentration-dependent increase in lymphocyte proliferation was observed with a calculated EC3 value of 0.051% compared to that of 0.089%, previously determined for glutaraldehyde. Immunoglobulin (Ig) E-inducing potential was evaluated by phenotypic analysis of draining lymph node (DLN) cells and measurement of total and specific serum IgE levels. The 0.1 and 0.75% exposed groups yielded significant increases in the IgE+B220+ cell population in the lymph nodes while the 0.75% treated group demonstrated significant increases in total IgE, OPA-specific IgE, and OPA-specific IgG(1). In addition, significant increases in interleukin-4 messenger RNA and protein expression in the DLNs were observed in OPA-treated groups. The results demonstrate the dermal irritancy and allergic potential of OPA and raise concern about the proposed/intended use of OPA as a safe alternative to glutaraldehyde.",

We examined the acute toxicity of OPA in male ICR mice injected with 0.125-0.5% OPA and killed some animals 1 day after a single OPA injection, and others 1 or 13 days after two OPA injections 5 days apart. Hematology, blood cell counts, specific antibody production, organ weights, hepatic enzymes, hepatic histopathology and gene expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) mRNA in liver were examined. Single OPA injections elevated leukocyte counts, the proportion of neutrophils, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Two OPA injections dose-dependently increased leukocyte counts, the proportion of neutrophils, ALT and AST, and decreased alkaline phosphatase. Leukocyte counts and proportions of neutrophils normalized 13 days after the second of two injections. However, both ALT and AST remained high in mice given higher OPA doses. Significant increased liver-to-body weight ratio and mild hepatic lesions were observed. Gene expression of CYP1a1 and CYP2e1 revealed a tendency of up-regulation 1 day after two OPA injections. However, expression of these genes was then down-regulated 13 days after OPA injections. OPA induced specific IgE and IgG significantly in the sera, suggesting that OPA acts as a hapten. Overall, OPA caused acute inflammation and acted as a haptenic allergen, although it caused only mild liver injury. Such evidence suggested that careful washing and prevention of exposure were needed after OPA disinfection of medical instruments.",

Phthalic acid (PA) is a common final metabolite of phthalates, and its isomers include isophthalic acid (IPA), terephthalic acid (TPA), and phthalaldehyde (o-phthalic acid, OPA). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether PA and PA isomers exert reproductive toxicity, including altered sperm movement. In vitro cell viability assays were comparatively performed using Sertoli and liver cell lines. In animal experiments, PA or PA isomers (10, 100, or 1000 mg/kg) were administered orally to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, and semen samples were analyzed by computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA). PA treatment produced a significant effect on curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), mean velocity or average path velocity (VAP), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), and frequency of head displacement or beat cross-frequency (BCF), whereas IPA, TPA, and OPA induced no marked effects. In vitro cell viability assays showed that mouse normal testis cells (TM4) and human testis cancer cells (NTERA 2 cl. D1) were more sensitive to PA and OPA than mouse liver normal cells (NCTC clone 1469) and human fetal liver cells (FL 62891). Our study suggests that PA and PA isomers specifically produced significant in vitro and in vivo reproductive toxicity, particularly sperm toxicity and testis cell cytotoxicity. Of the isomers examined, PA appeared to be the most toxic and may serve as a surrogate biomarker for reproductive toxicity following mixed exposure to phthalates.",

We evaluated the alterations in GA or OPA in rats after subacute inhalation exposure by determining levels of neurotransmitters (norepinephrine [NE], dopamine [DA], DA metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid [DOPAC] and homovanillic acid [HVA], indoleamine serotonin [5-HT] and 5-HT metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid [5-HIAA]) in discrete brain regions using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with an electrochemical detector. Female Wistar rats were exposed to 0, 50, 100, or 200 ppb gaseous GA or OPA by inhalation for 1 hr per day, 5 d per week for 4 wk. Following the exposure, the brain of each rat was removed and dissected into cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, midbrain, corpus striatum and hypothalamus. The neurotransmitters and their metabolites were extracted from each brain region, and determined by HPLC. Regarding GA, the daily water intake of the 50 or the 200 ppb exposed groups was significantly lower than that of the control. DA and 5-HIAA levels in the medulla oblongata among the GA exposed groups were significantly lower than those of the control. For OPA, the mean final body weight and daily food intake of the 100 or 200 ppb exposed groups were significantly lower than those of the control. The mean DA concentrations in the cerebrum in the groups exposed to OPA were significantly lower than those of the control. OPA may modulate DA metabolism in the cerebrum of female rats. The levels GA or OPA that induced alienations in neurotransmitters were comparable to those levels usually found in hospitals, further studies are warranted to evaluate the of safety of disinfectants containing GA or OPA.",

                                                    "String": "Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats and mice were exposed to o-phthalaldehyde at concentrations of 0, 0.44, 0.88, 1.75, 3.5, or 7.0 ppm, 6 hours plus T90 (17 minutes) per day, 5 days per week for 14 weeks; additional groups of 10 male and 10 female clinical pathology study rats were exposed to the same concentrations for 23 days. All rats exposed to 7.0 ppm died by the end of week 2 of the study, and seven males and two females exposed to 3.5 ppm died by week 7 of the study. All mice exposed to 7.0 ppm died during week 1 of the study, and five males and four females exposed to 3.5 ppm died by week 6 of the study. Clinical observations in rats and mice included abnormal breathing, sneezing, and thinness, with increasing frequency in higher exposure groups. In rats, clinical observations also included black discoloration of the appendages (pinnae and/or feet), which was noted throughout the study in male and female rats exposed to 3.5 ppm or greater. Clinical observations in mice also included alopecia. Mean body weights of all surviving exposed groups of male rats and 1.75 and 3.5 ppm female rats were significantly less than those of the chamber controls. Mean body weights of all surviving exposed groups of male and female mice were significantly less than those of the chamber controls, and 3.5 ppm males lost weight during the study. In the hematopoietic system of rats, decreases in lymphocyte counts in males and females coincided with increases in neutrophil counts. These alterations in lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were consistent with stress and inflammation. Decreased lymphocyte counts corresponded to lymphoid atrophy in the thymus and spleen. Within the erythron, the erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin concentrations, hematocrit values, and packed cell volumes were significantly elevated in both male and female rats at all time points. Erythron increases at the earlier time points were consistent with a physiological hemoconcentration, while increases at study termination may have been due to hypoxia with a resultant secondary erythrocytosis. In the hematopoietic system of mice, the total leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, as well as neutrophil and eosinophil counts, were increased in males at study termination. Similarly, female mice had increased total leukocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil counts. The increases in the leukon were generally consistent with inflammation. Hemoglobin concentrations, erythrocyte counts, hematocrit values, and packed cell volumes were decreased in male and female mice. The decreases in the erythron were most likely due to bone marrow suppression as a result of the chronic inflammation in the respiratory tract. Inhalation exposure to o-phthalaldehyde resulted in a spectrum of lesions at sites of contact within the respiratory tract (nose, larynx, trachea, and lung), skin, and eye that were generally consistent with an irritant effect. In general, exposure of rats and mice to o-phthalaldehyde resulted in lesions throughout the respiratory tract that included necrosis, inflammation, regeneration, hyperplasia, and metaplasia, ranging from minimal to moderate in severity. In general, histologic findings occurred at deeper sites within the respiratory tract with increasing exposure concentration. The first site of contact, the nose, was most affected, with many lesions occurring at the lowest exposure concentration (0.44 ppm) in male and female rats and mice. Laryngeal lesions occurred at all exposure concentrations in rats and at 0.88 ppm or greater in mice. Tracheal findings were first noted at a variety of exposure concentrations. Lung findings were most prevalent at the two highest exposure concentrations (3.5 and 7.0 ppm) in rats and mice. In the skin, there were significant increases in adnexa degeneration and epithelial parakeratosis in both male and female rats and mice. In the eye, there were significant increases in suppurative inflammation of the anterior chamber and cornea, as well as corneal necrosis in male and female rats. Rats exposed to o-phthalaldehyde exhibited lower cauda epididymis, epididymis, and testis weights. In rats, total sperm/cauda exhibited a negative trend and sperm motility was lower. There were no histopathologic correlates identified that could explain the observed responses in sperm parameters, or the weight changes in the testis or epididymis. However, in the higher dose groups where morbidity and mortality were observed, testicular and epididymal histopathologic lesions were noted. In the testes, these lesions included significant increases in the incidences of elongated spermatid degeneration, apoptosis of the germinal epithelium, and interstitial cell atrophy. In the epididymis of male rats, there were significant increases in the incidences of exfoliated germ cells and apoptosis of the epithelium. The mice also displayed decreased sperm motility, and some testicular and epididymal histopathologic lesions, including significantly increased incidences of exfoliated germ cells of the epididymal duct, as well as multifocal cellular depletion of the germinal epithelium, and interstitial cell atrophy of the testis. o-Phthalaldehyde was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation (S9 mix); no mutagenicity was seen in TA100 with S9 or in TA98 or Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA/pKM101, with or without S9. Following 3 months of inhalation exposure to o-phthalaldehyde, no increases in the frequencies of micronucleated reticulocytes were observed in male or female Sprague Dawley rats. In B6C3F1/N mice following 3 months of inhalation exposure to o-phthalaldehyde, a small increase in micronucleated reticulocytes was seen in male mice exposed to 3.5 ppm, but no significant increases in micronuclei were seen in erythrocytes of male mice or in reticulocytes or erythrocytes of female mice. A small increase in the percentage of reticulocytes was seen in female mice at the highest dose tested (3.5 ppm). Under the conditions of these 3-month inhalation studies, there were treatment-related lesions in male and female rats and mice. The major targets from o-phthalaldehyde exposure in rats and mice included the respiratory system (nasal cavity, larynx, trachea, and lung), skin, eye, testis, and epididymis. The most sensitive measure of o-phthalaldehyde inhalation toxicity in male and female rats and mice was significantly increased incidences of nasal cavity lesions (lowest-observable-effect concentration = 0.44 ppm). A no-observed-effect concentration was not reached in rats or mice of either sex.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.2X10-3 mm Hg at 21 \u00b0C indicates o-phthalaldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase o-phthalaldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours. o-Phthalaldehyde has an absorption peak at 297 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, o-phthalaldehyde is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. o-Phthalaldehyde is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, o-phthalaldehyde is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to o-phthalaldehyde may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where o-phthalaldehyde is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to o-phthalaldehyde via contact with products containing residual disinfectant. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Evaporated from a thermostated vessel, CBr2F2 was mixed immediately with the main air supply (gas density of 1.90 gm/cm3), the ambient atmospheric content controlled by floating-body gauges and monitored by gas densitometer at the exhaust end of the experimental chamber. Treatment in 2 cats each of 99.4 and 96.4 vol% samples was associated with clinical signs of increasing gravity with increasing atmospheric concentrations, including enlarged pupils and blinking eyelids, arched back, head shaking, raised fur, tremor, slight to extreme restlessness, static gait, optisthotonus, gasping, salivation, prostration and marked ataxia, tonic convulsions, and clonic convulsions. The symptoms, their time to onset and the associated atmospheric levels of CBr2F2 were largely consistent between individual cats and samples, with behavioral changes and narcosis first noted at approximately 0.5% v/v (10 minutes) and convulsions at 2.2-2.7 v/v (44-57 minutes). The time to near recovery, generally defined by the authors by the cat's return to its feet, ranged from 2.5 to 10 minutes after termination of the exposures, although ataxia persisted (duration unspecified) in all animals.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 820 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibromodifluoromethane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dibromodifluoromethane will be degraded slowly in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be greater than 44 years. Dibromodifluoromethane absorbs very little UV radiation above 290 nm and is not expected to photolyze at a significant rate in the ambient atmosphere. If released to soil, dibromodifluoromethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 49. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.03 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization of dibromodifluoromethane from dry soil surfaces is expected to occur rapidly based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, dibromodifluoromethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.5 hrs and 5.7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 6.9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Based upon the highly halogenated structure of dibromodifluoromethane, biodegradation is expected to be slow. Although there is no experimental evidence of dibromodifluoromethane hydrolyzing in the ambient environment, similarly structured organic halide compounds are known to hydrolyze at an extremely slow rate (half-lives > 100 years). Occupational exposure to dibromodifluoromethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dibromodifluoromethane is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to dibromodifluoromethane via inhalation of ambient air and from fire extinguisher products containing dibromodifluoromethane. Dibromodifluoromethane is widely detected in the atmosphere due to its long-term stability. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.03 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.5 hrs and 5.7 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 6.9(SRC), from an estimated log Kow(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Based upon the highly halogenated structure of dibromodifluoromethane, biodegradation is expected to be slow(8).",

Vapor-phase dibromodifluoromethane is slowly degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be greater than 44 years(3), based on its rate constant of <5.0X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4). Dibromodifluoromethane absorbs very little UV radiation above 290 nm and is not expected to photolyze at an environmentally important rate in the ambient atmosphere(5). Based on dibromodifluoromethane's long residence time in the atmosphere, it will diffuse gradually into the upper limits of the troposphere, and eventually into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will contribute to ozone depletion(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

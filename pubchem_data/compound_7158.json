For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Carboxylic acids with six or fewer carbon atoms are freely or moderately soluble in water; those with more than six carbons are slightly soluble in water. Soluble carboxylic acid dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Many insoluble carboxylic acids react rapidly with aqueous solutions containing a chemical base and dissolve as the neutralization generates a soluble salt. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Insoluble carboxylic acids react with solutions of cyanides to cause the release of gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymer",

Hyporeflexia and lethargy progressing to coma, with constricted pupils (miosis). 3. Flaccid paralysis has been described in one comatose patient, grand mal convulsions with opisthotonos in another, hypertonia with areflexia in a third, and twitching and jerking in a fourth. ... 5. Progressive decline in blood pressure with death in deep coma. The possibility that hyperpyrexia and hypermetabolism may have contributed to the fatal outcome does not appear to have been ruled out (one comatose patient was described as sweating profusely). A terminal pneumonia is likely. 6. Disturbance in body temp regulation may be encountered. Perhaps severe reduction of body temp in cool or cold environments. More probably, febrile reponses in warm environments or during exercise. 7. Progressive hypotension with death in peripheral vascular collapse, perhaps associated with acidosis due to lactic acidemia and other products of hypermetabolism. 8. In nonfatal poisonings, severe and protracted neuritis with pain, paresthesias and weakness. ... Humans have experienced muscle fasciculations as well as myotonia. Chronic exposure may lead to central nervous system defects in the control of motor function. /2,4-D/",

Cancellation of all registered uses in US was put into effect on January 2, 1985. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.0X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4,5-TP will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4,5-TP will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 35 hours. Particulate-phase 2,4,5-TP will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2,4,5-TP was shown to degrade when exposed to ultraviolet light. If released to soil, 2,4,5-TP is expected to have high mobility based upon Koc values of 74 and 107. The pKa of 2,4,5-TP is 2.84, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because anions do not volatilize. 2,4,5-TP exhibited biodegradation half-lives in soil of 8 to 290 days, suggesting that biodegradation in soil is variable depending on soil type. If released into water, 2,4,5-TP is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. No biodegradation of 2,4,5-TP was observed after 50 days incubation in fresh water suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. The pKa indicates 2,4,5-TP will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 58 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since 2,4,5-TP lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since 2,4,5-T is no longer produced or used in the US (Jan, 1985). In the past, 2,4,5-T was applied directly to plants as an emulsifiable concentrate and exposure to this compound was primarily by inhalation and dermal contact and in the field where it was applied. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may have been exposed to 2,4,5-TP via ingestion of food and contaminated drinking water. (SRC)",

Volatilization of 2,4,5-TP from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because anions do not volatilize. 2,4,5-TP is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 1.0X10-5 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5). 2,4,5-TP exhibited biodegradation half-lives in soil of 8(6) to 290 days(7), suggesting that biodegradation in soil is variable depending on soil type(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Negligible degradation was observed in air-dried soils(1). Biodegradation of 2,4,5-TP was tested in Mardin, Honeoye and Dunkirk silt loam soil samples from areas in NY, resulting in complete disappearance in greater than 47, 124 and 205 days, respectively(2). 2,4,5-TP was shown to have an aerobic half-life of 16 days in soil(5). 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol has been identified as a product of the biodegradation of 2,4,5-TP(6). 2,4,5-TP was shown to have a half-life of 8 and 10 days in sandy loam, 15 and 21 days in forest soil, 13 days in clay loam and 14 days in grassland soil(7). In soil, 2,4,5-TP was reported to degrade more slowly than 2,4-D(8). No biodegradation of 2,4,5-TP was observed after 50 days incubation in Hamilton Harbour water from Ontario, Canada(3). An initial concn of 2,4,5-TP of 107.5 ppm was completely degraded in lagoon water in 9 days after 100 ml of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol acclimated water was added and incubated at 20 to 21 \u00b0C with constant aeration(4). 2,4,5-TP, incubated at 25 \u00b0C with sewage sludge in an aeration tank for 47 days gave an unchanged concentration of the S enantiomer and a 40% decrease in the R enantiomer(9).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(2), these Koc values suggest that 2,4,5-TP will have high mobility in soil(SRC). 2,4,5-TP had sorption values of 2.7-5.9 mg/kg at different conditions in soil with a pH of 7.4, and sorption values of 0.2-1.1 mg/kg in soil with a pH of 8.2(3). 2,4,5-TP had reported sorption coefficients of 308-9016 mL/g(4). 2,4,5-TP is expected to be negatively charged and will not be readily absorbed making it more mobile in soil(5). The pKa of 2,4,5-TP is 2.84(6), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(7).",

Of 77 wells tested in the Mississippi Alluvial Aquifer July 29 and Sept 23, 1996, two in Desha County contained 2,4,5-TP at 0.23 and 0.28 ug/L(8). A national summary conducted from 1971 to 1991 of pesticides in groundwater revealed 2,4,5-TP in 28 of 3,876 wells tested at concns of 0.002 to <3.0 ug/L(9). Spring water tested at 16 sites in Canada from 1991 to 1994 found 1 sample at a concn of 0.5 ng/L from the North Tile drain in Outlook, Saskatchewan(10).",

Of 20 selected streams sampled in the western US, 2,4,5-TP was detected in 11; concns ranged 0.01-0.14 ppb(3). 2,4,5-TP was detected on 29 of 30 sampling days over a 4 year period in the Humboldt River near Rye Patch, NV(3). Earlier sampling of these same streams yielded 5 of 200 samples positive, range of 0.01-0.21 ppb with the Humboldt River having 8 of 11 sampling times over a 2 year period positive and again having the higher concns(4). 2,4,5-TP was not detected in 11 midwestern streams during the 1965-1967 sampling period(5). 2,4,5-TP had the following values from the Ohio River Valley: Beaver River, Beaver Falls, PA, 0.02 ppb; Wabash, New Harmony, TN, 0.03 ppb; Allegheny, Monongahela, Muskingum, Kanawha, Big Sandy, Licking, Great Miami, Ohio, White, and Cumberland Rivers were all not detected(6). Of 167 stations sampled in a national river survey, 0.6% had detectable levels of 2,4,5-TP; 0.1% of the 1,768 samples contained 2,4,5-TP(7). 2,4,5-TP was not detected in surface water samples taken in 1986 in IA(8). 2,4,5-TP was detected in Kalinadi River, India at <100 ug/L(9). 2,4,5-TP had a maximum concn of 0.08 ug/L in the River Elbe, Germany in 1994(10). 2,4,5-TP was detected in 45 samples (total number unspecified) with a maximum detection of 0.07 ug/L taken from 20 stations on selected western streams in a survey running from 1968 to 1971(11).",

In the past, 2,4,5-T was applied directly to plants as an emulsifiable concentrate and exposure to this compound was primarily by inhalation and dermal contact and in the field where it was applied. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may have been exposed to 2,4,5-TP via ingestion of food and contaminated drinking water(SRC).",

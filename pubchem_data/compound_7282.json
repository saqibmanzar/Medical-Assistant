Pure hexane is used in laboratories. Most of the hexane used in industry is mixed with similar chemicals called solvents. The major use for solvents containing hexane is to extract vegetable oils from crops such as soybeans. These solvents are also used as cleaning agents in the printing, textile, furniture, and shoemaking industries. Certain kinds of special glues used in the roofing and shoe and leather industries also contain hexane. Several consumer products contain hexane, such as gasoline, quick-drying glues used in various hobbies, and rubber cement. (L175) ",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This study reports these coefficients for certain solvents (n-pentane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, n-hexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, 3-methylhexane, and n-heptane). The tissues considered were the lung, heart, muscle, fat, brain, kidney, and liver collected from 2 cadavers with no histological abnormalities. Blood/air partition coefficients were significantly correlated with the tissue/air partition coefficients. The mean solubility of the 9 solvents was higher than in blood in all the tissues studied, with the factors ranging from 1.4 (lungs) to 205(fat).",

This was done by measuring blood levels from 85 chemically sensitive patients These were measured by a purging trap method with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry by the methods of Laseter. Thirteen patients had blood levels below the detection limit of less than 1 ppb and 72 were above the detection limit. An average of three solvents, out of seven measured, including n-pentane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, cyclopentane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, was found in 85% of the patients' blood on the 1 to 299 ppb range. The means were as follows: n-pentane 14.7 ppb, 2,2-dimethylbutane 2.5 ppb, cyclopentane 9.0 ppb, 2-methylpentane 16.7 ppb, 3-methylpentane 28.0 ppb, n-heptane 5.5 ppb. The most frequently found of the above solvents was 2-methylpentane (found in 68.1% of the patients), 3-methylpentane (62.5%), n-hexane (61.1%), and pentane (40.3%).",

Individual exposure ranges were 32-500 mg/cu m for n-hexane, 11-250 mg/cu m for 2-methylpentane and 10-204 mg/cu m 3-methylpentane. The metabolites of commercial hexane in the urine of 41 workers were measured at the end of the work shift. 2-Hexanol, 2,5-hexanedione, 2,5-dimethylfuran and gamma-valerolactone were found as n-hexane metabolites and 2-methyl-2-pentanol as 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane metabolites. The presence of metabolites in the urine was correlated more positively with 2-hexanol and 2,5-hexanedione than with 2,5-dimethylfuran and gamma-valerolactone. A good correlation was found between total n-hexane metabolites and n-hexane exposure. Urinary excretion of hexane metabolites may be used for monitoring occupational exposure to n-hexane and its isomers.",

Cyclohexanol, 2-methyl-2-pentanol, 3-methyl-2-pentanol, and trichloroethanol were determined in connection with exposure to cyclohexane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, and trichloroethylene, respectively. 2-Hexanol, 2,5-hexanedione, 2,5-dimethylfuran, and gamma-valerolactone were all determined in connection with n-hexane exposure only. 2,5-Hexanedione was the principal n-hexane metabolite found in the workers' urine. This finding of the experimentally proven neurotoxin 2,5-hexanedione in the urine of shoe-factory workers exposed to \"commercial hexane\" is consistent with the idea that this compound is responsible for the development of neuropathy in this group of individuals.",

It is distributed throughout the body in the blood, and metabolized by mixed function oxidases in the liver to a number of metabolites. The initial reaction is oxidation by cytochrome P-450 isozymes to hexanols, predominantly 2-hexanol. Further reactions convert 2-hexanol to 2-hexanone, 2,5-hexanediol, 5-hydroxy-2-hexanone, 4,5-dihydroxy-2-hexanone and the neurotoxicant 2,5-hexanedione. Hexane metabolites are excreted in the urine, while unchanged hexane is excreted in expired air. (L175)",

Samples collected in 1-l glass bottles are purged at 60 C for 1 hr in an ultrapure helium gas stream using an open loop arrangement. Volatile eluates are trapped onto selective adsorbents packed inside stainless steel tubes connected in series. After stripping at a flow rate of 100 mg/min for 60 min, the adsorbent tubes are disconnected, fitted with analytical desorption caps and sequentially desorbed for 10 min on a thermal desorber. The desorbed organics are trapped at 30 C on a packed cold trap prior to flash volatilization of the volatiles across a fused silica transfer line onto a capillary column. The method separated over 200 organic compounds within 40 min using flame ionization and ion trap detection and is capable of quantitation down to 5 ng/l per component. The recoveries of 3-methylpentane from water at 30 and 60 C were 65 and 93%, respectively.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Methods: The performance of activated carbon cloth to absorb 2- and 3-methylpentane was studied by experimental vapor exposure followed by solvent extraction and gas chromatography. Urine from workers and rats exposed to 2- and 3-methylpentane was analysed by gas chromatography with or without acid or enzymatic hydrolysis. Results: Carbon cloth absorbed 2- and 3-methylpentane linearly to exposures up to eight hours and to 400 ppm, and was sensitive enough to detect a 15 minute peak of exposure. The two isomers were clearly separated from hexane on a DB-l column. For analysis of the urine, enzymatic hydrolysis was superior to acid hydrolysis. Exposure of rats to methylpentane vapors showed that 2-methyl-2-pentanol and 3-methyl-2-pentanol were excreted in urine in proportion to the dose of 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane, respectively. 2-Methyl derivatives of 1-, 3-, and 4-propanol, 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol, and 3-methyl-2-pentanol were minor metabolites. Analysis of urine from the exposed workers showed that 2-methyl and 3-methyl-2-pentanol are leading urinary metabolites after exposure to the corresponding methylpentane. Conclusions: Diffusive sampling is applicable to monitor 2- and 3-methylpentane vapors as is the case for hexane vapor. 2-Methyl-2-pentanol and 3-methyl-2-pentanol will be markers of occupational exposure to 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane, respectively. Also, 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol might be a marker of exposure to 2-methylpentane.",

Since this risk was not found in the shoe industry, where these solvents are widely used, we carried out a case-control study on the risk of spontaneous abortion in a health district (Veneto, Northern Italy) where about 8,000 people work in shoe manufacturing. Aliphatic hydrocarbons were generally used; their concentrations were repeatedly below the mixture TLVs in the observation  period. Methods: Cases (clinically recognized spontaneous abortion, ICD codes 632-634-636) and age-/year-/residence-matched controls (admitted for normal delivery) were traced in the files of the regional hospital discharges register. Data on 108 cases (81% response) and the same number of reference subjects were collected on questionnaires completed by nurses trained in occupational medicine. There were questions on confounding and occupational factors, and an open question to ensure a complete description of work done during pregnancy. An occupational physician, working blind, then coded exposure to organic solvents according to a three-level polytomous variable (no, low, high exposure). The cases/controls not exposed, exposed to low levels and exposed to high levels of organic solvents were 78/88, 12/12, and 18/8 respectively. Adjusted for the confounding factors, the relative risk (RR) of spontaneous abortion for high exposure to organic solvents during pregnancy was 3.85, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) ranging from 1.24 to 11.9. RR was 1.58 (CI = 0.62-4.06) in women exposed to low solvent concentrations. Our results support the hypothesis that spontaneous abortion may be an adverse effect of exposure to high levels of organic aliphatic solvents in women employed in shoe manufacture."

AIM: To investigate potential biological mechanisms underlying MCS in a case-control study. Two hundred and twenty-three MCS cases and 194 controls (urban females, aged 30-64 years) fulfilled reproducible eligibility criteria with discriminant validity. Routine laboratory results and serum levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were compared. Dose-response relationships, a criterion for causality, were examined linking exposures to likelihood of case status. Routine laboratory investigations revealed clinically unimportant case-control differences in means. Confounder-adjusted odds ratios (OR) showed MCS was negatively associated with lymphocyte count and total plasma homocysteine, positively associated with mean cell hemoglobin concentration, alanine aminotransferase and serum vitamin B6, and not associated with thyroid stimulating hormone, folate or serum vitamin B12. More cases than controls had detectable serum chloroform (P = 0.001) with the OR for detectability 2.78 (95% confidence interval = 1.73-4.48, P < 0.001). Chloroform levels were higher in cases. However, cases had significantly lower means of detectable serum levels of ethylbenzene, m&p-xylene, 3-methylpentane and hexane, and means of all serum levels of 1,3,5- and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, 2- and 3-methylpentane, and m&p-xylene. Our findings are inconsistent with proposals that MCS is associated with vitamin deficiency or thyroid dysfunction, but the association of lower lymphocyte counts with an increased likelihood of MCS is consistent with theories of immune dysfunction in MCS. Whether avoidance of exposures or different metabolic pathways in cases explain the observed lower VOC levels or the higher chloroform levels should be investigated.",

As regards all ten solvents studied, alveolar concentration (Ca) and the difference between environmental concentration (Ci) and alveolar concentration (Ci-Ca), were correlated with environmental concentration. According to the slopes of the regression lines, the ratio between alveolar and environmental concentration (Ca/Ci) and the alveolar retention ((Ci-Ca)/Ci) in the case of all ten solvents studied were complementary, i.e., their sum was equal to unity. The solvents with high solubility in blood, i.e., toluene, styrene, methylethyl ketone, acetone, and dimethylformamide showed a Ca/Ci ratio lower than 0.5 and the solvents with low solubility, i.e., cyclohexane, hexane, and their isomers showed a Ca/Ci ratio higher than 0.5.

After periods ranging from 7 to 30 weeks the animals were perfused with glutaraldehyde and samples of nerves were processed for light microscopy of sections and of teased fibers. Animals treated with n-hexane at 5000 ppm (14 weeks) or 2500 ppm, (30 weeks) developed the typical giant axonal degeneration already described in rats treated continuously with 400 to 600 ppm of the same solvent for 7 weeks or more. No such alterations were found in rats subjected to the following intermittent respiratory treatments: n-hexane 500 ppm (30 weeks), or 1500 ppm (14 weeks), cyclohexane 1500 or 2500 (30 weeks), n-pentane 3000 ppm (30 weeks), n-heptane 1500 ppm (30 weeks), 2-methylpentane 1500 ppm (14 weeks), and 3-methylpentane 1500 ppm (14 weeks). The following metabolites were found in the urine of rats according to treatment (in parenthesis): 2-methyl-2-pentanol (2-methylpentane); 3-methyl-2-pentanol and 3-methyl-3-pentanol (3-methylpentane), 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol, gamma-valerolactone, 2,5-dimethylfuran, and 2,5-hexanedione (n-hexane). 2-Hexanol was found to be the main urinary metabolite of n-hexane, while 2,5-hexanedione was present only in a lesser proportion. This feature of rat metabolism suggests that in this species 2,5-hexanedione reaches an effective level at its site of action during intermittent respiratory treatment with n-hexane with difficulty and explains the high concentrations necessary to cause polyneuropathy in rats subjected to this treatment.[Frontali N et al; Clin Toxicol 18 (12): 1357-67 (1981)]",

Commercial hexane solvent contained several 6-carbon isomers including mostly n-hexane, 3-methylpentane, methylcyclopentane, and 2-methylpentane. Both in-vitro and in-vivo tests were conducted. Chinese-hamster-ovary cells were exposed to nine concentrations of commercial hexane solvents ranging from 5.0 x 10-4 to 5.0 uL/mL. At completion of a 6 hr exposure cells were washed with buffered saline containing bromodeoxyuridine for 20 hr. The mitotic index was determined, and chromosome aberrations were sought in Giemsa stained preparation. Sprague-Dawley-rats of both sexes were exposed, nose only, to 6 hr of commercial hexane solvent at target concentrations of 900, 3,000, and 9,000 ppm. Rats were sacrificed at 6 hr and 24 hr postexposure (colchicine being administered 2 hr prior to sacrifice by intraperitoneal injection). Bone marrow cells were obtained and examined after Giemsa staining. Results of the commercial hexane solvent cell screening test showed that the highest doses tested produced overt cellular toxicity and corresponding reductions in mitotic indices. Cell cycle kinetics was delayed at these levels. In the absence of S9 activation cell toxicity was evident at the three highest commercial hexane solvent concentrations. However, no chromosome alterations were evident in any group tested. In the in-vivo assay increased lacrimation was the only overt sign of toxicity. The cytogenetic analysis showed no increase in chromosomal damage irrespective of concentration bone marrow collection time or sex of the animal. /It was/ concluded that the mixture of 6-carbon isomers comprising commercial hexane solvent does not have any significant genotoxic activity.[Daughtrey WC et al; Journal of Applied Toxicology 14 (3): 161-165 (1994)]",

Test mixtures consisted of the following ratios (expressed as ppm) of n-hexane isomers that contained six carbon atoms free of n-hexane: 0/0; 125/0, 125/125; 125/375; 125/1375; 500/0.  Neuropathy of central and peripheral nervous system fibers (giant axonal swellings containing accumulated neurofilaments) was seen only in the 500/0 ppm mixture.  A 2nd phase of the study was conducted in male rats similarly exposed to hexane concentrations of 0, 500 ppm n-hexane-free hexanes (mixed hexanes) (Group II), 500 ppm n-hexane/500 ppm mixed hexanes (Group III), or 500 ppm n-hexane (Group IV).  Abnormal gait and decreased body weight were observed in Group III and IV animals, along with trace to mild atrophy of sciatic and/or anterior tibial nerves.  Nerve and muscle lesions were not evident in rats treated with 500 ppm of mixed hexanes.  Renal lesions and increased mean absolute and/or relative weight of kidneys were seen in all treatment groups.[EPA/OTS; Doc #40-8223010]",

Natural sources of 3-methylpentane include petroleum, natural gas, ocean water, and underwater hydrocarbon vents. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 190 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-methylpentane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-methylpentane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 28 days. 3-Methylpentane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-methylpentane is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 3-Methylpentane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 3-Methylpentane degraded 100% after 30 days in activated sludge during a closed-bottle test, but an acclimation period of 27.4 days was observed. Therefore, biodegradation in soil and water is expected to be an important fate process, however volatilization is expected to be the dominant fate process. If released into water, 3-methylpentane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 57 minutes and 3.7 days, respectively.  However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 131 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 3-methylpentane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-methylpentane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 3-methylpentane via inhalation of ambient air with this compound and from other consumer products containing 3-methylpentane. 3-Methylpentane was widely detected in air samples taken from roadway tunnels and urban centers. Studies indicate that transportation exhaust is the major source of 3-methylpentane concentration in air. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC)derived from its vapor pressure, 190 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 17.9 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 57 min and 3.7 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 11 days if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 320(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 3.6(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). 3-Methylpentane biodegraded 100% after 30 days using an activated sludge inoculum but following 27.4 days acclimation(10), indicating that biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process in water(SRC).

Technical 3-methylpentane test sample and an abiotic control, under the same test conditions, exhibited CO2 production of 100% and 18%, respectively, after 30 days(1). 3-Methylpentane was observed to have a lag period of 27.4 days and a degradation rate of 66 umol/hr(1). A final mineralization yield of 31% was calculated(1).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The suburban route was 23 km with an average exposure time of 23 minutes and the NYC commute, made under low ventilation conditions, was 49 km and 45 minutes on the turnpike and 5 km and 33 minutes in the tunnel(2). The concns of 3-methylpentane in a car and train (n=8) during parallel commuter trips in Goeteborg, Sweden was 10.5 and 2.0 ug/cu m, respectively(3).

The roadway samples were collected along a busy interstate during morning rush hour in August. Other roadway emission profiles for 3-methylpentane in wt% are: Chicago, 1.69(2); Lincoln Tunnel, 1.72(2,4); Atlanta roadway, 1.56(2); Caldecott Tunnel, San Francisco, CA (6/26-8/1991) 1.85%, mean(5). The Chicago profiles were taken on a confined parkway during rush hour traffic. 3-Methylpentane constituted 2.5-3.1 wt% of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) in a Swedish tunnel(6), 2.8 wt% in a tunnel in Budapest, Hungary(7). Tunnel emission are composed of evaporative losses and exhaust(7). The ground level emissions 1 mi downwind from a refinery contained 0.88-1.48 wt%, mean 1.21 wt% 3-methylpentane(2). An earlier study reported 1.27-9.36 wt%, mean 3.42(3).",

Exposure of service station attendants was significantly reduced when vapor recovery systems were present(2). In longterm personal samples for 3-methylpentane obtained at a high volume service station in eastern Pennsylvania (n=18) 3 samples were 0.1-0.3 ppm and 15 were <0.1 ppm(1). 3-Methylpentane is often found in glue used in shoe manufacturing; of the 43 glues analyzed, 48% contained 3-methylpentane(3). The percent of 3-methylpentane in the glues ranged from 1-35% with a mean and median of 12% and 14%, respectively(3). 3-Methylpentane was not used in the 22 solvents analyzed that were used as glue diluents(3). Traffic emissions have been identified as a major source of 3-methylpentane detected in indoor air of office buildings in Greece(4). 3-Methylpentane was identified in 5 of 8 samples in New Jersey analyzed as part of the USEPA Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) study(5).",

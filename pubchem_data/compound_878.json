PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The gas is absorbed rapidly through the respiratory system and directly translocated to the vascular system. Methyl mercaptan binds to protein and erythrocytes and is extremely effective in stabilizing erythrocyte membranes against hypotonic hemolysis. The compound reacts directly with collagen. Methyl mercaptan can be metabolized by serving as a methyl, sulfur, or methylthio donor for the synthesizing amino acids and proteins. The compound is readily oxidized to carbon dioxide and inorganic sulfates. Ip admin of radiolabeled materials to male rats resulted in approx 40% excretion as carbon dioxide in expired air within 6 hr of admin, and 6% in expired air as unchanged mercaptan in the first hr. Urinary excretion over an 8-hr period accounted for approx 30% of the admin dose. Tissue levels were notable in plasma protein, liver, kidney, lung, spleen, and testis.",

Administration of a noncomatogenic dose of methanethiol through inspired air or injection into the upper colon resulted in an elevation of the concentrations of methanethiol mixed disulfides in serum (protein--S--S--CH3 and X--S--S--CH3, X yet unknown) and in urine (X--S--S--CH3). The concentrations of methanethiol mixed disulfides proved to be a relative measure of exposure to methanethiol. The levels of volatile sulfur compounds methanethiol, dimethylsulfide and dimethyldisulfide in the air expired by rats exposed to a noncomatogenic dose of methanethiol through the colon were also elevated. Rats with acute hepatic encephalopathy caused by liver ischemia also showed elevation of methanethiol mixed disulfide levels on challenge of methanethiol through the colon or inspired air, but to a significantly smaller extent than did the corresponding sham-operated rats. This suggests that the liver is at least partly responsible for formation of methanethiol mixed disulfides. No additional toxic effects were observed in the rats with ischemic livers on methanethiol exposition when compared with normal rats, suggesting that the liver does not play an essential role in methanethiol detoxification. Metabolism of methanethiol by blood to sulfate, for example, might be more important. In rats with acute hepatic encephalopathy caused by liver ischemia and in dogs suffering from hepatic encephalopathy resulting from chronic liver disease, large and significant increases in ammonia levels were measured. However, the mean levels of methanethiol mixed disulfides in rats and dogs with hepatic encephalopathy were not different from the mean normal levels in these animals. ...",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Studies are presented to identify the possible biochemical basis of anesthesia-like effects of methanethiol and those features, which distinguish such effects from common anesthetics and may represent the basis of its toxicity. CH3SH was found to stabilize erythrocyte membranes against hypotonic hemolysis at relatively low concentrations. At 37 degrees C the AH25 value for human erythrocyte antihemolysis was observed at a concentration of 0.34 mumol of CH3SH bound per mg of erythrocyte protein. Similar results were obtained with rat erythrocytes. This property of CH3SH is in common with other anesthetic agents. Anesthetic agents also inhibit the membrane-associated Na+, K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase); however, for effective and nontoxic agents of this type the inhibition of ATPase activity is elicited at concentrations which are at least an order of magnitude higher than those which influence the membrane stability characterized by the antihemolysis effect. CH3SH was also found to inhibit the membrane Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The I25 value for the inhibition of human erythrocyte ATPase activity was obtained at CH3SH concentration of 0.12 mM which corresponded to 0.3 umol of CH3SH bound per mg of erythrocyte membrane protein. Rat erythrocyte membrane ATPase was somewhat more sensitive to CH3SH. In all cases, the binding of CH3SH to erythrocytes occurred primarily on the membrane. These results indicate that no differential exists with respect to the dose-response of these two activities associated with human erythrocyte membrane.",

Clinical pathology is mediated in part by the production of pyrogenic cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-6. Methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), a volatile sulfur compound produced by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, has been shown to contribute to the production of IL-1 by human mononuclear cells. In this report, /the authors/ investigated the production of IL-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 by human pulp fibroblasts when stimulated for various periods of time with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without the presence of CH3SH. We found that LPS and CH3SH had no effect on the production of IL-1 or TNF-alpha. However, LPS stimulated IL-6 production, and this production was augmented when CH3SH was present. /It was concluded/ that the volatile sulfur compound CH3SH plays a role in activation and modulation of the immune response through its role in production of IL-6.",

The results show that the permeability of porcine non-keratinized sublingual mucosa is increased by up to 75% or 103% following exposure to H2S and CH3SH, respectively. The effect may be attributed to VSC reaction with tissue components resulting in alteration in the integrity of the tissue barrier. The increase in permeability of the mucosa to (35)S-Na2SO4 was dependent on both the time of exposure and concentration of VSC in the head-space. The (35)S-H2S was retained by the mucosal tissue and was able to penetrate the intact layers consisting of non-keratinized epithelium, basal membrane, and connective tissue. Treatment of the mucosa with 0.22% ZnCl2, either prior to or after exposure to CH3SH, nullified the effect of CH3SH and restored the permeability to a state similar to that observed in control 95% air/5% CO2 systems.",

These catalysts favor thiol formation, whereas disulfides are the main products in acidic medium. Promoters for thiol formation include a range of metal oxides, potassium and sodium tungstates, and heteropolyacids and their salts.

Recovery yields for methanethiol from an aqueous model system and a soy protein concentrate (SPC) aqueous slurry determined with this method ranged from 97 to 107% and from 103 to 121%, respectively. The methanethiol content of two commercial SPCs and two commercial soy protein isolate (SPI) samples, on a dry basis, ranged from 835 to 1190 times greater than the odor threshold for methanethiol. Relative standard deviations for quantifying methanethiol with the method from these samples were <5%, indicating its good reproducibility in quantifying methanethiol from soy protein products. Also investigated in the current study was the feasibility of using 5',5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) to determine the concentration of methanethiol in the aqueous solutions used to prepare the standard curve for quantifying methanethiol from soy protein products. The concentrations of methanethiol obtained from Ellman's reagent method were comparable with those from a weighing method and theoretical calculation",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Place towels in a safe place such as a fume hood for evaporation. Allow sufficient time for evaporation of the vapors so that the hood duct work is free from methyl mercaptan vapors. Burn the paper in a suitable location away from combustible material. 5. Large quantities of liquids containing methyl mercaptan may be absorbed in vermiculite, dry sand, earth, or a similar material and placed in an appropriate container. Methyl mercaptan should not be allowed to enter a confined space such as a sewer because of the possibility of an explosion. 6. Liquids containing methyl mercaptan may be collected by vacuuming with an appropriate system. If a vacuum system is used, there should be no sources of ignition in the vicinity of the spill, and flashback prevention devices should be provided.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Although the mechanism is unclear, the potential of EGCg in reducing halitosis caused by volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) has been suggested. This study tested the hypothesis that EGCg reduces VSCs by suppressing mgl, the gene encoding L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase, responsible for methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) production by oral anaerobes. In this study, the effect of EGCg on in vitro growth, CH3SH production, and mgl gene expression in P. gingivalis W83 was investigated. EGCg inhibited growth of P. gingivalis W83 (MIC = 97.5 ug/mL) and was bactericidal (MBC = 187.5 ug/mL). At sub-MIC levels, EGCg inhibited CH3SH production, and mgl mRNA and protein expression (p < 0.05). /The authors/ conclude that EGCg may represent a natural and alternative agent to the antimicrobial chemicals currently available for halitosis control.",

These should concentrate on the function and integrity of the nervous and respiratory systems. Medical surveillance for respiratory disease should be conducted by using the principles and methods recommended by NIOSH and the American Thoracic Society (ATS). A preplacement medical evaluation is recommended in order to detect and assess preexisting or concurrent conditions which may be aggravated or result in increased risk when a worker is exposed to methyl mercaptan at or below the NIOSH REL. The examining physician should consider the probable frequency, intensity, and duration of exposure, as well as the nature and degree of the condition, in placing such a worker. Such conditions, which should not be regarded as absolute contraindications to job placement, include chronic diseases of the respiratory system.",

When rats were injected with 40-120 umol methanethiol a range of responses was obtained which varied between normal consciousness and coma. The minimum blood concentration of methanethiol associated with coma (200 nmol/mL) was at least 10-fold greater than in patients with hepatic encephalopathy but brain concentrations were similar in comatose rats and those which remained awake. Blood methanethiol concentrations were similar in control and germ free rats and did not rise in cirrhotics or controls after ingestion of 2 g methionine. It is concluded that while methanethiol may accumulate in hepatic coma, it is unlikely to be of major pathogenetic importance. Endogenous mercaptans are unlikely to originate from bacterial metabolism in the gut.",

When various smaller dosage combinations of NH4+, methanethiol, and octanoic acid were injected simultaneously, coma occurred at lower brain and blood concentrations of ammonia and methanethiol. Brain ammonia and methanethiol concentrations in normal rats receiving 0.75 mmol NH4+ plus 0.15 mmol octanoic acid plus 18 umol methanethiol were comparable with those observed in 24 rats in hepatic coma after fulminant hepatic failure caused by acute massive ischemic liver necrosis. The normal rats became comatose. In these rats and in the rats in hepatic coma, the ammonia level in the brain was increased threefold and the methanethiol level in the brain was increased fivefold. Because these levels of ammonia and methanethiol were sufficient to induce coma in normal rats, they should also have been sufficient to induce coma in rats with damaged livers. Therefore, the accumulation of ammonia and methanethiol in the central nervous system after the acute massive ischemic necrosis may have been sufficient to account for the coma that ensued, without the involvement of other factors.",

Potential industrial emission sources include wood pulp, petroleum-processing, and sewage treatment plants. Methyl mercaptan is also generated in salt marshes, soils, freshwater algae, and decomposing algal mats. A major source of methyl mercaptan is the microbial degradation of methionine. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1,510 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl mercaptan will exist as a gas above its normal boiling point of 5.95 \u00b0C. Gas-phase methyl mercaptan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11.7 hours. In the night-time atmosphere, methyl mercaptan will react with nitrate radicals with a half-life of about 1 hour. Methyl mercaptan absorbs UV light at 290 nm suggesting that it may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methyl mercaptan is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 13. However, gaseous methyl mercaptan adsorbs to dry and moist soil surfaces. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.12X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl mercaptan may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The importance of volatilization from soil surfaces may be attenuated by gas-phase adsorption to soil. Under anaerobic conditions in soils, dimerization of methyl mercaptan to dimethyl disulfide will occur. If released into water, methyl mercaptan is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 0.8 hours and 2.8 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Methyl mercaptan is produced under anaerobic conditions (e.g. in salt marshes) by sulfate-reducing and methane-producing bacteria from methionine, or reversibly formed from dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide. Ultimately, methyl mercaptan may be mineralized to methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide. When incubated in anaerobic lake sediment for 4 hrs, methyl mercaptan was rapidly mineralized. Occupational exposure to methyl mercaptan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl mercaptan is produced or used. Workers will primarily be exposed to methyl mercaptan via inhalation in work settings such as pulp mills and oil refineries or water treatment works. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methyl mercaptan via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of some foods. (SRC)",

Gaseous methyl mercaptan has been observed to partition to soils(3). For example, when gaseous methyl mercaptan was passed over six air-dried and moist (50% field capacity) soils, 2.4-32.1 mg/g and 2.2-21.4 mg/g of methyl mercaptan rapidly adsorbed to the dry and moist soils, respectively(3). It was suggested that adsorption to soil surfaces might be an environmental sink for gaseous methyl mercaptan(3). Volatilization of methyl mercaptan from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.0031 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure, 1,510 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4), and water solubility, 15,400 mg/L(5). Methyl mercaptan is expected to volatilize rapidly from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure and because it is a gas a temperatures above 6 \u00b0C(SRC). However, the importance of volatilization from soil surfaces may be attenuated by gas-phase adsorption to soil surfaces(SRC). Methyl mercaptan is produced under anaerobic conditions (e.g., in salt marshes) by a variety of organisms and is often liberated during the decay of sulfur-containing organic matter(6). It may be formed by sulfate-reducing and methane-producing bacteria from methionine, or reversibly formed from dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide(6). Ultimately, methyl mercaptan may be mineralized to methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide(6). The oxidation and consequent dimerization of methyl mercaptan to dimethyl disulfide occurs for soils supplemented with methionine and its sulfoxide, and sulfone or S-methyl cysteine(7). This results in part from the formation of methyl mercaptan and subsequent dimerization to dimethyl disulfide(7).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.0031 atm-cu  m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 1,510 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 15,400 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 0.8 hours and 2.8 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its estimated log Kow of 0.78(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Methyl mercaptan is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Methyl mercaptan is produced under anaerobic conditions (e.g. in salt marshes) by a variety of organisms and is often liberated during the decay of sulfur-containing organic matter(7). It may be formed by sulfate-reducing and methane-producing bacteria from methionine, or reversibly formed from dimethyl sulfide and dimethyldisulfide(7). Ultimately, methyl mercaptan may be mineralized to methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide(7). When incubated in anaerobic lake sediment from Lake Mendota, WI for 4 hr, methyl mercaptan was rapidly mineralized(8).",

Methyl mercaptan has a normal boiling point of 5.95 \u00b0C(2), so at temperatures above 5.95 \u00b0C, methyl mercaptan will exist as a gas in the atmosphere(SRC). Gas-phase methyl mercaptan is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with  photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11.7 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.29X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The half-life for the reaction of methyl mercaptan with ozone in the atmosphere has been reported to be 140 hr(4). The rate constant for the gas-phase reaction of methyl mercaptan with nitrate radicals that exist in the night-time atmosphere ranged from 8.1X10-13 to 12.2X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec(5); this corresponds to an average atmospheric half-life of about 1 hour(SRC) at an atmospheric concentration of 2.4X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(5). The UV spectrum of methyl mercaptan shows a log epsilon of 0.7 at 290 nm(6) suggesting that methyl mercaptan may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Methyl mercapatan appears to be produced ubiquitously by a majority of heterotrophic bacteria by enzymatic sulfide-dependant thiol methyltransferase activity(2). It may be formed by sulfate-reducing and methane-producing bacteria from methionine, or reversibly formed from dimethyl sulfide and dimethyldisulfide(1). Ultimately, methyl mercaptan may be mineralized to methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide(1). When incubated in anaerobic lake sediment from Lake Mendota, WI for 4 hr, methyl mercaptan was rapidly mineralized(3). Addition of methyl mercaptan to sediment slurries from seven chemically different anoxic aquatic environments stimulated methane production without any noticeable lag(1). These sediments included two estuarine salt marshes, a freshwater lake, and two hypersaline alkaline lakes(1). For the one sediment in which rate information was presented, biodegradation was completed within a week(1). Methyl mercaptan is produced anaerobically from dimethylsulfide (and 3-methiolpropionate) in salt marshes(2). The oxidation and consequent dimerization of methyl mercaptan to dimethyldisulfide occurs for soils supplemented with methionine and its sulfoxide, and sulfone or S-methylcysteine(2). This results in part from the formation of methyl mercaptan and subsequent dimerization to dimethyldisulfide(2).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 11.7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Kinetic evidence suggests that the hydroxyl radical adds to the sulfur atom, forming an adduct, or complex with the mercaptan(2,3); sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a major product of this reaction(4). The half-life for the reaction with ozone in the atmosphere has been reported to be 140 hr(5); no rate constant was available(SRC). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of methyl mercaptan with nitrate radicals that exist in the night-time atmosphere ranged from 8.1X10-13 to 12.2X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec(6). This corresponds to an average atmospheric half-life of about 1 hour(SRC) at an atmospheric concentration of 2.4X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(6). The reaction products include formaldehyde, sulfur dioxide, methyl nitrate as well as particulate methane sulfonic acid and inorganic sulfate(7). Methyl mercaptan is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(8). The UV spectrum of methyl mercaptan shows a log epsilon of 0.7 at 290 nm(9) suggesting that methyl mercaptan may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Gaseous methyl mercaptan has been observed to partition to soils(3). For example, when gaseous methyl mercaptan was passed over six air-dried and moist (50% field capacity) soils, 2.4-32.1 mg/g and 2.2-21.4 mg/g of methyl mercaptan rapidly adsorbed to the dry and moist soils, respectively(3). Neither the capacity or rate of sorption was correlated to soil pH, organic matter content, or clay content; sterile controls ruled out the involvement of  microorganisms(3); it was suggested that adsorption to soil surfaces might be an environmental sink for gaseous methyl mercaptan(3).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that methyl mercaptan is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 0.8 hours(SRC).

Methyl mercaptan's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to occur(SRC).  Methyl mercaptan is expected to volatilize rapidly from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure and because it is a gas a temperatures above 6 \u00b0C(SRC). However, gaseous methyl mercaptan gas has been found to strongly adsorb to moist and dry soil surfaces suggesting that adsorption might be an environmental sink for methyl mercaptan(4).

Methyl mercaptan has been identified in the off-gas from shale oil retorting in Rio Blanco and Paraho, Colorado(2). Methyl mercaptan, at a concentration of 128 ppb, was found in the effluent of a community septic tank near Tacoma, WA; however, it was not found in the influent(3). Methyl mercaptan was found in both the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants receiving municipal wastes and waste from a viscose plant and a french fried potato plant(4). Wastewater from the viscose plant was rich in sulfate and the residence time in the distribution system was sufficient to deplete the water of oxygen, thereby creating anaerobic conditions(4). Effluent gases from a sulfate-cellulose mill were reported to contain 94 ppm methyl mercaptan(5). The concentration of methyl mercaptan in leachate from 3 hazardous waste sites in Germany ranged from not detected to 600 ug/L(6). A survey of about 2,950 industrial facilities in North Carolina reported fugitive and stack emissions of methyl mercaptan totaling 239,594 pounds/year(7).",

Occupational exposure to methyl mercaptan may occur through inhalation with this compound at workplaces where methyl mercaptan is produced or used(SRC). Workers will primarily be exposed to methyl mercaptan in industries such as pulp mills, oil refineries, or water treatment works(SRC). However, since methyl mercaptan has a extremely unpleasant odor and its odor threshold in air is 1.6 ppb(2), it is unlikely that workers would tolerate exposure to concentrations above the odor threshold for a substantial time(3). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methyl mercaptan via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of some foods(SRC).",

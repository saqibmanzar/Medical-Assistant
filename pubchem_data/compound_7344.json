ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as a solvent for nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, many cellulose ethers, resins.  It is also the active ingredient in many antiacne preparations; and used in the preparation of lacquers, paints, enamels, varnishes, stencil sheets, safety glass, flavoring, and cosmetic formulations (0.2%).  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY:  Etyl lactate was not a skin irritant or skin sensitizer in humans, when tested at 8% in petroleum.  In a separate human study, ethyl lactate applied to the skin significantly reduced skin pH, the number of bacteria recoverable from skin, and the hydrolysis of sebum to free fatty-acid by bacterial lipases.  ANIMAL STUDIES:  Ethyl lactate is irritating to the rabbit eye and guinea pig skin (intradermal injections).  It is a central nervous system depressant and lethal to animals in high concentrations, causing respiratory paralysis.  One out of 8 rats died when fed a diet containing 5% ethyl lactate.  No evidence of teratogenicity or maternal toxicity was observed in the testing of other lactate esters. Ethyl lactate was applied percutaneously on the back of groups of pregnant rats on days 6 to 15 of gestation.  Applied doses were 0, 517, 1551, or 3619 mg/kg bw.  Slight erythema and desquamation was observed in treated animals at the application site.  No other clinical signs or necropsy observations were noted.  No effects were observed on the development. Ethyl lactate was negative for mutagenicity in the Ames test using strains TA 98, 100, 1535, 1537, and 1538.",

Degenerative and regenerative changes in the nasal cavity were noted in all studies. The NOAEL in ethyl, n-butyl, and isobutyl-l-lactate vapor studies was 200 mg/cu m. For aerosol exposure, 2-ethylhexyl-l-lactate, the most toxic of the lactates, minimal damage to the nasal epithelium was noted at 75 mg/cu m with vapor being slightly less toxic than the aerosol. Lactates do not appear to cause systemic toxicity, except at very high concentrations (1800 mg/cu m or higher). These systemic effects may be secondary to severe irritation seen at high doses. Sensory irritation tests suggest that a vapor exposure limit of 75 mg/cu m ( approximately 15 ppm) should prevent irritation in humans and therefore an occupational exposure level for vapor of 75 mg/cu m is recommended. However, aerosol exposure should be kept as low as possible. The low vapor pressure of the higher molecular weight esters would tend to keep vapor exposure low and the odor of lactate esters serves as a warning of exposure. These lactate esters are readily biodegradable, suggesting little concern from an environmental point of view. /Lactate esters/",

Ethyl lactate is found in fruits and vegetables. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.75 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl lactate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl lactate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.1 days. Ethyl lactate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethyl lactate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.8X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyl lactate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Using the Closed Bottle screening test, ethyl lactate exhibited 22 and 75% theoretical BOD in 5 and 28 days, respectively, suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, ethyl lactate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected in water based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 72 and 7 days at pH 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to ethyl lactate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl lactate is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ethyl lactate via ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing ethyl lactate.

Vapor-phase ethyl lactate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.1 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.9X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 23 \u00b0C(3). Ethyl lactate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

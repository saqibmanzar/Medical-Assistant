ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.06 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates 1,2-bis(2-chloroethoxy)ethane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,2-bis(2-chloroethoxy)ethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.8 days. If released to soil, 1,2-bis(2-chloroethoxy)ethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 19. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.8X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. 1,2-Bis(2-chloroethoxy)ethane may be moderately resistant to biodegradation. The compound was not degraded by bacteria isolated from soil enriched with triethylene glycol. If released into water, 1,2-bis(2-chloroethoxy)ethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,2-bis(2-chloroethoxy)ethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2-bis(2-chloroethoxy)ethane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,2-bis(2-chloroethoxy)ethane via ingestion of drinking water containing 1,2-bis(2-chloroethoxy)ethane. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

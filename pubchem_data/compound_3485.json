It is claimed that it provides a bioavailable source of carbon for higher plants that is not available to algae. Though not marketed as such due to federal regulations, the biocidal effect of glutaraldehyde kills most algae at concentrations of 0.5 - 5.0 ppm. These levels are not harmful to most aquatic fauna and flora. Adverse reactions have been observed by some aquarists at these concentrations in some aquatic mosses, liverworts, and vascular plants. Glutaraldehyde is a colorless liquid with a pungent odor used to disinfect medical and dental equipment. It is also used for industrial water treatment and as a chemical preservative. Glutaraldehyde is an oily liquid at room temperature (density 1.06 g/mL), and miscible with water, alcohol, and benzene. It is used as a tissue fixative in electron microscopy. It is employed as an embalming fluid, is a component of leather tanning solutions, and occurs as an intermediate in the production of certain industrial chemicals. Glutaraldehyde is frequently used in biochemistry applications as an amine-reactive homobifunctional crosslinker. The oligomeric state of proteins can be examined through this application. However, it is toxic, causing severe eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, along with headaches, drowsiness and dizziness. It is a main source of occupational asthma among health care providers. Glutaral has been shown to exhibit antibiotic function (A7907). Glutaral belongs to the family of Aldehydes. These are organic compounds containing the aldehyde functional group.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Although 90% of the disinfectant was concentrated on the roads, 10% was sprayed on cattle sheds and other sites where foot-and-mouth disease occurred. Since the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in November 2010, there has been a steady increase in disinfectant use. Consequently, its adverse environmental effects have prompted government officials to take preventive measures. The major chemical components of the disinfectants are citric acid, potassium sulfate base complex, quaternary ammonium compound, malic acid, and glutaraldehyde, ranging in amounts from tons to hundreds of tons. The exact amount of each component of the disinfectants could not be identified because the types of components used in the different commercial formulations overlapped. In this review, we obtained information on disinfectants that are widely used nationwide, including the types of major chemical components and their respective toxicities (both human and ecological).",

The indication of endoscopy was health check-up for all patients. Published English-language studies regarding acute rectocolitis following endoscopy were also reviewed. RESULTS: An outbreak of six patients occurred in April 2002 and one cirrhotic patient was admitted in July 2008. All patients developed a self-limited syndrome of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea within 48 h of uncomplicated endoscopy. One severely ill patient required hospitalization to receive intravenous fluid and antibiotics. After the investigation in April 2002, glutaraldehyde-induced colitis was diagnosed due to a defect in the endoscope-cleansing procedure. There were no deficiencies in the cleansing procedure in July 2008. Considering the patient's concomitant disease, we postulated that ischemic colitis with cirrhosis-related intestinal inflammation and endotoxemia was the possible diagnosis in this sporadic case. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopists should be aware of this iatrogenic complication in patients presenting with acute rectocolitis, especially in those who have undergone recent endoscopic examination. An outbreak of acute rectocolitis following endoscopy should be considered glutaraldehyde-induced and should lead to an investigation of cleansing and equipment-disinfection procedures. In the absence of strong evidence of an outbreak, an infectious disease, or contamination of glutaraldehyde, a sporadic case should be considered ischemic colitis especially in patients with relevant concomitant diseases or predisposing factors.",

The dermal absorption rate constant was low (0.2-2 hr) in each species. The elimination times were long for both intravenous injection (t0.5 for the rat 10 hr, rabbit 15-30 hr) and dermal application (t0.5 for the rat 40-110 hr, rabbit 20-100 hr), possibly due to the binding of glutaraldehyde to protein and the slow excretion of metabolites.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Based on a review of these data and on public comments on the Agency's assessments for the active ingredient glutaraldehyde, the Agency has sufficient information on the human health and ecological effects of glutaraldehyde to make decisions as part of the tolerance reassessment process under FFDCA and reregistration process under FIFRA, as amended by FQPA. The Agency has determined that glutaraldehyde-containing products are eligible for reregistration provided that: (i) confirmatory data needs are addressed; (ii) the risk mitigation measures outlined in this document are adopted; and (iii) label amendments are made to reflect these measures. ... Based on its evaluation of glutaraldehyde, the Agency has determined that glutaraldehyde products, unless labeled and used as specified in this document, would present risks inconsistent with FIFRA. Accordingly, should a registrant fail to implement the risk mitigation measures identified in this document, the Agency may take regulatory action to address the risk concerns from the use of glutaraldehyde. If all changes outlined in this document are incorporated into the product labels, then all current risks for glutaraldehyde will be substantially mitigated for the purposes of this determination. Once an Endangered Species assessment is completed, further changes to these registrations may be necessary as explained in Section III of this document.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health  and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1,  1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in  accordance to newer safety standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection  Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the  effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for  human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than  those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List  D. Glutaraldehyde is found on List B. Case No: 2315; Pesticide type: fungicide, antimicrobial; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document.; Active ingredient (AI): Glutaraldhyde; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 06/10/91, 07/15/92, 10/13/95; AI Status: The producers of the pesticide have made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

It is registered for pesticide use in the U.S. but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. It is used as algaecide, bacteriocide and fungicide. Glutaraldehyde is used as a tissue fixative in histology and electron and light microscopy, generally as a 1.5-6% aqueous solution. Glutaraldehyde is used, generally in conjunction with wetting agents, to control viruses and other micro-organisms in fish farming. Glutaraldehyde is allowed as a preservative in cosmetics in Europe at concentrations up to 0.1%. It is not allowed in aerosols and sprays. Glutaraldehyde is a biocide commonly used in a 2% concentration for cold sterilization of surgical and dental equipment. Biocides, such as glutaraldehyde, are added to eliminate bacterial growth in fracturing fluids. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Exposure to concentrations < 1 ppm by inhalation or skin contact may cause irritation of the skin and/or mucous membranes. The critical effects of glutaraldehyde exposure are eye, skin, and respiratory irritation, skin sensitization and occupational asthma. Nose and throat irritation has been observed in humans at vapor concentrations below 0.2 ppm. Occupational asthma has also been reported in workers exposed to dilute solutions of glutaraldehyde. Contact dermatitis and eye irritation have been reported in workers using glutaraldehyde solutions, usually 2% or higher. Skin sensitization has been confirmed in workers using dilute solutions. Other symptoms that may be brought on by glutaraldehyde exposure include heart palpitations and tachycardia. The incidence of death and incidence of cancer deaths in 186 male employees at a glutaraldehyde production unit were compared to those of US white males and to 29,000 other chemical workers during the period 1959 - 1978. All subjects were observed for 10 yr. The number of deaths was less than expected, as was the incidence of cancer deaths. ANIMAL STUDIES: Glutaraldehyde was corrosive to the skin and eyes of rabbits at high concentrations, with signs of skin irritation evident at 2%, and eye irritation at 0.2%. In an inhalation study where mice were exposed to glutaraldehyde at concentrations of 33 or 133 ppb for 24 hours, the animals exhibited panting and increased grooming, mice that inhaled the highest concentration developed toxic hepatitis. Following a single whole-body inhalation exposure at 1 ppm for 1 day, rats and mice developed coagulation pathology of the upper respiratory tract squamous epithelium. After 4 days of such exposures, inflammatory granulocytic infiltrate into the squamous epithelium and lamina propria with thickened epithelium of the nasal lumen ensued. In those animals inhaling 0.5 or 1 ppm glutaraldehyde for four days, the nasal passages became obstructed with intraluminal debris; degenerative/hyperplastic erosions with epithelial abscesses extended as far as the nasopharyngeal meatus in the 1-ppm exposure group. A study of male and female rats given glutaraldehyde in drinking water at concentrations of 0, 50, 250, or 100 ppm through two generations indicated a dose-related decrease in parental water consumption and body weight (attributed to adverse taste) and decrease in offspring (1000-ppm group) body weights. No adverse reproductive effects were observed. In other study there was a significant dose-dependent reduction in the average of maternal body weight gain and a significant increase in the number of stunted (body weight) and malformed fetuses at the 5 mL/mg/day dose level. Early mutagenicity studies were negative, but more recent studies have indicated that glutaraldehyde is mutagenic in vitro in bacterial assays and tests in mammalian cells. In vivo genotoxicity tests to date have proven negative. Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats and mice were exposed to glutaraldehyde vapor at concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 (rats) and 0, 0.062, 0.12, or 0.25 ppm (mice) 6 hr/day, 5 days /week. The incidences of non-neoplastic lesions of the nose were reported to be significantly increased in the 0.50 and 0.75-ppm exposed rats and in the 0.12 and 0.25-ppm exposed male and female mice. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Available chronic toxicity data for glutaraldehyde indicate that continuous exposure results in measurable effects on coldwater fish at a concentration of 5.1 mg a.i./L. A second study on coldwater fish resulted in measurable effects at 2.5 mg a.i./L. Measurable effects on freshwater invertebrates were noted at concentrations of 8.5 mg/L product and 4.9 mg a.i./L.",

Spirometry and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed before and after SIPT. The serum and BALF concentrations of CC16 and cytogram content in BALF were evaluated. In GA-sensitized asthmatics, the level of CC16 in BALF and serum was significantly lower at 24 hr after SIPT in comparison with the values recorded prior to the experiment. There was a significant increase in the proportion of eosinophils, basophils and lymphocytes in BALF of GA-sensitized asthmatics obtained after SIPT. ... The determination of CC16 either in serum or in BALF is a non-invasive test to detect Clara cell damage.",

For chemesthetic sensitivity, assessment included the variable of duration, with focus on whether concentrations initially too low to evoke feel in the eye or upper airway might do so in exposures up to 15 min. Experiment 1 probed sensitivity with forced-choice testing of detection over ranges of concentrations appropriate to three endpoints: odor, feel in the eye, and feel in the nose. A subject participated in hours of testing per endpoint to yield enough data to erect a psychometric (concentration-response) function. Exposure in Experiment 1 entailed use of a vapor-delivery system that stimulated sites of interest separately. Exposure in Experiment 2 occurred in the ambient environment of a chamber, with the sites stimulated simultaneously. In that case, subjects rated confidence by the minute that they felt the presence of vapor in the eyes, nose, and throat during exposures of 15 minutes to 35, 50, 75, and 100 ppb, a blank, and an odor control of mild heptane. In Experiment 1, the typical subject achieved 50% detection (threshold) of odor at 0.3 ppb. The typical subject achieved 50% detection of feel in the eye and nose at 390 and 470 ppb, respectively. Psychometric functions for feel showed much sharper dependence on concentration than those for odor. In Experiment 2, confidence in detection of feel migrated progressively away from no-with certainty toward the zone of uncertainty, with bigger change when the exposures contained any glutaraldehyde. The ratings of confidence failed, however, to show distinguish among these concentrations. Glutaraldehyde has much higher odor potency than previously thought. Its green-apple odor should signal presence of the vapor at levels more than a 100-fold below any that might evoke sensory irritation in brief exposures. Exposures that start decidedly below irritating (100 ppb and below) seem unlikely to turn irritating over time. Although the effects from these concentrations differentiated themselves from those of air and an odor control, they exhibited none of the concentration dependence seen for sensations of feel. They seemed likely driven by the penetrating odor of glutaraldehyde.",

No increase in chromosomal aberrations was induced by glutaraldehyde in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells with or without S9 at one laboratory; at another laboratory, chromosomal aberrations were induced in the absence of S9 only. Glutaraldehyde did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in germ cells of male /Drosophila/ melanogaster treated as adults by feeding or injection or treated as larvae by feeding. In vivo, glutaraldehyde induced a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations in mouse bone marrow cells 36 hr after a single intraperitoneal injection. In a subset of the 36 hr chromosomal aberrations test, there was a small increase in the number of micronucleated bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes, which was judged to be equivocal. Additional short-term (3 day) and subchronic (13 week) micronucleus tests in mice, using the intraperitoneal or inhalation routes, respectively, yielded negative results.",

The information may include data from toxicity tests performed on aquatic and/or terrestrial organisms, where available (e.g., acute or chronic aquatic toxicity data for fish, algae, and crustaceans; toxicity data on birds, bees, and plants).  This section also includes information on whether there is a potential for the chemical to persist or degrade in the environment either through biodegradation or other processes (such as oxidation or hydrolysis) as well as the concentration or amount of the chemical found in the environment (e.g., in plants, animals as well as in the atmosphere or water).",

GA or its metabolites may reach aquatic ecosystems due to incomplete or inadequate treatment of wastewaters ... In this work, a battery of toxicity tests with primary producers, primary consumers and secondary consumers were performed and a species sensitive distribution (SSD) for GA was built. Moreover, effects on biomarkers (catalase, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione-S-transferase, and cholinesterase) were measured in Danio rerio embryos and adults. Primary consumers (Thamnocephalus platyurus 24hr - EC50=3.6 mg/L; Daphnia magna 48 hr - EC50=6.6 mg/L) and D. rerio adults (96 hr - LC50=5.5 mg/L) were slightly more sensitive to GA than D. rerio embryos (96 hr - LC50=22.2 mg/L) and primary producers (Lemna minor 168 hr - EC50=73.8 mg/L; Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata 72hr - EC50=12.3 mg/L; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 72 hr - EC50=14.6 mg/L; Chlorella vulgaris 72 hr - EC50=31.3 mg/L). However, no significant differences between the trophic levels were found and general HC5 and HC50 values of 0.6 and 11.4 mg/L were respectively estimated. Despite the low GA toxicity to D. rerio embryos, hatching delay and malformations were found (96 hr - EC50=11.9 mg/L). For biomarkers, an inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase activity was observed in embryos whereas an inhibition in catalase, lactate dehydrogenase and glutathione-S-transferase activities was observed in adults. Thus, GA is moderately toxic (doses>1mg/L) to aquatic organisms, independently of the trophic level. However, considering the varied range of effects depending on the life stage and organism tested and relatively low HC5 value of 0.6 mg/L, mesocosm and chronic toxicity tests seem to be the next step in direction of more realistic scenarios of GA risk assessment in aquatic ecosystems.",

After their use, disinfectants and surfactants reach the wastewater network together. The discharge of chemical compounds from hospital activities into wastewater is also a well-known problem, causing pollution of water resources and constituting an ecological risk for aquatic organisms. In this study, the chemistry and toxicology of GA and surfactant mixtures were reviewed in order to estimate their fate in aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, their joint effects on aquatic organisms were experimentally assessed in the laboratory. A simple model of the additive joint action of toxicants was used to determine combined acute toxicity effects on the bacteria luminescence and Daphnia mobility of three mixtures containing GA at 1.5 x EC50 24 hr [in mg/L] on Daphnia and anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants at twice their critical micellar concentration (CMC). The mixture of GA and a cationic surfactant gave an EC50 30 min on Vibrio fischeri of 0.158%, with a concentration of 0.04 mg GA/L and 1.04 mg CTAB/L, which provided an additive action. The interaction between GA and an anionic surfactant on V. fischeri produced an antagonistic joint action with an EC50 30 min of 3.95%, containing 1.06 mg GA/L and 33.2 mg SDS/L. A synergistic action with an EC50 30 min of 8.4% on V. fischeri was observed for the mixture containing GA and a nonionic surfactant. Antagonistic interactions were observed for the joint action between GA and the surfactants studied on Daphnia. The mixture of GA and CTAB was more toxic (EC50 24 h=0.02%) than the two other mixtures (EC50 24 hr GA+SDS=6%; EC50 24 hr GA+TX 100=10%). This study provides new data on the toxicity of certain hospital pollutants entering the aquatic environment and detected in surface and groundwaters. ...",

To assess the potential for environmental impacts associated with glutaraldehyde, three standard chronic toxicity bioassays were performed: 96-hr phytoplankton growth bioassays using Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (formerly, Selenastrum capricornutum), three-brood reproduction bioassays using Ceriodaphnia dubia, and an embryo-larval bioassay using steelhead trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. For the green alga, P. subcapitata, significant decreases in growth were observed at glutaraldehyde concentrations greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/L. Embryos of O. mykiss demonstrated a similar sensitivity with exposures of 2.5 mg/L resulting in a 97% reduction in hatch rate. In most cases, this failure to hatch was due to the inability of the embryo to leave the chorion and not to early embryo mortality. In contrast, reproduction and mortality rates in C. dubia were not as sensitive to glutaraldehyde: decreased reproduction was detected at 4.9 mg/L (the lowest observed effect concentration), and is similar to concentrations causing acute mortality in adults (4.7 mg/L for the estimated LC(50), or 50% lethal concentration).",

Its use as a biocide in water treatment, hydraulic fracturing fluids and oil-field applications and as a preservative in cosmetics and personal-care products will result in its direct release to the environment. Glutaraldehyde has been detected in gasoline and diesel engine emissions. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.6 mm Hg at 30 \u00b0C indicates glutaraldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase glutaraldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours. Glutaraldehyde may be susceptible to direct photolysis in the atmosphere based upon aqueous photolysis studies. If released to soil, glutaraldehyde is expected to have very high to moderate mobility based upon measured Koc values ranging from 5.1 to 500. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.3X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Glutaraldehyde is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure and it has been reported that small amounts of glutaraldehyde will volatilize to the atmosphere. Results of biodegradation screening tests indicate that glutaraldehyde is readily biodegradable. A soil degradation study using a loamy sand soil observed a pseudo-first order dissipation half-life of 1.7 days due primarily to soil microorganisms. If released into water, glutaraldehyde is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. In a closed bottle test using seawater as inoculum, glutaraldehyde showed 73% degradation in 28 days indicating that biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. At 25 \u00b0C, glutaraldehyde has measured hydrolysis half-lives of 508-628, 102-394 and 46-63.8 days at pH 5, pH 7 and pH 9 respectively. The measured half-life for the photolysis of aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde exposed to natural sunlight was 196 days. Occupational exposure to glutaraldehyde may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where glutaraldehyde is produced or used. Use and limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to glutaraldehyde via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with consumer products containing glutaraldehyde.

At 25 \u00b0C, glutaraldehyde has measured hydrolysis half-lives of 508-628, 102-394 and 46-63.8 days at pH 5, pH 7 and pH 9 respectively(2,3). The measured half-life for the photolysis of sterile aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde exposed to natural sunlight was 196 days(2).",

Using OECD Guideline 301C (Ready biodegradability: Modified MITI Test (I)), glutaraldehyde reached 74% of its theoretical BOD in 28 days and 80% DOC in 15 days with classified the compound as readily biodegradable(2). Glutaraldehyde was found to be readily biodegradable using OECD Guideline 301D (Closed Bottle Test)(2). In a DOC die-away test, glutaradehyde, present at 25 mg/L, showed 83% degradation in 5 days using a sewage inoculum(3). Glutaraldehyde, present at 8.3 mg/L, degraded 60% in 28 days using sewage inoculum in a CO2 evolution test(3). In a closed bottle test, glutaraldehyde present at 2.0 mg/L, degraded 64% in 28 days using a Polyseed inoculum(3). A higher biodegradability with a short lag time was observed when the glutaraldehyde concentrations in the test systems were low (<2 mg/L) than when the concentrations were high (>8 mg/L). Since bacterial inhibition for glutaraldehyde occurs at about 5 mg/L, the lower biodegradation rates observed in studies where high concentrations of glutaraldehyde were used were likely due to inhibition of the inoculum(3). In a closed bottle test using seawater as inoculum, glutaraldehyde showed 73% degradation in 28 days(3). The major metabolite of glutaraldehyde produced by microbes in an aerobic sediment-river water system was carbon dioxide, with glutaric acid formed as an intermediate in the water phase(3). The calculated pseudo-first-order half-life of glutaraldehyde catabolism in water (based on the loss of the parent compound) under aerobic conditions was 10.6 hours(3). A soil degradation study using a loamy sand soil and initial glutaraldehyde concentration of 10 ppm observed a pseudo-first order biodegradation half-life of 1.7 days due primarily to soil microorganisms(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

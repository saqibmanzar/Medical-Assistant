When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In the group treated with fluoroacetamid 4 mg/kg. bw, serum LDH and HBDH rose significantly compared with control (p<0.01) 5 day later. On the day of 10, myocardial enzymes restored in all experiment groups with some interstitial fibroblastic proliferation.

Eighty Sprague-Dawley rats (SPF) were randomly divided into five groups, with 16 rats in each group: saline control group, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control group, TET exposure group, high-dose (2.8 g/kg/d) acetamide treatment group, and super-high-dose (5.6 g/kg/d) acetamide treatment group. Rats in the exposure group and treatment groups were exposed to TET by intragastric administration after fasting, and were then intramuscularly injected with saline or different doses of acetamide in the following 5 days. The cortex of the temporal lobe was collected at 3 hr, 12 hr, 48 hr, or 7 d after treatment. The expression levels of GABA and Glu in the cortex of the temporal lobe were determined by average optical density (OD) values in immunohistochemistry. ... The OD value of GABA in TET exposure group started to increase at 12 hr after treatment, reached the peak at 48 hr, and decreased to the normal level at 7 d. In the high-dose acetamide treatment group, the increase in OD at 12 hr was not so significant as that in the TET exposure group, OD value decreased to the normal level at 48 hr and was lower than that in the exposure group, and the changes were more like those in the control groups. In the super-high-dose acetamide treatment group, OD value began to increase significantly at 3 hr and was significantly higher than that in the TET exposure group (p<0.01), it reached the peak at 12 hr, and was restored to the normal value at 48 hr. ... The OD value of Glu in TET exposure group at 3 hr after treatment was significantly lower than those in the two control groups, it increased gradually from 12 hr to 48 hr, and recovered to the normal level at the 7th d. The changes in the high-dose acetamide treatment group were similar to those in the TET exposure group, but became more like those in the control groups after 48 hr; the OD value in super-high-dose acetamide treatment group was significantly higher than that in the TET exposure group at 3 hr after treatment (p<0.01), while no significant difference was found at 12 hr; it was significantly lower than those of all other groups at 48 hr and 7 d (p<0.01).

To clarify the mechanism of carcinogenesis by acetamide, we investigated DNA damage by andacetamide metabolite, acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), using 32P-5'-end-labeled DNA fragments. AHA treated with amidase induced DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II) and displayed a similar DNA cleavage pattern of hydroxylamine. DNA damage was inhibited by both catalase and bathocuproine, suggesting that H2O2 and Cu(I) are involved. Carboxy-PTIO, a specific scavenger of nitric oxide (NO), partially inhibited DNA damage. The amount of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) by amidase-treated AHA was similar to that by hydroxylamine. ESR spectrometry revealed that amidase-treated AHA as well as hydroxylamine generated NO in the presence of Cu(II). From these results, it has been suggested that AHA might be converted into hydroxylamine by amidase. These results suggest that metal-mediated DNA damage mediated by amidase-catalyzed hydroxylamine generation plays an important role in the carcinogenicity of acetamide.",

Deuterated acrylamide was chosen as the internal standard for analyzing the water sample. The derivatization of AA, PA, and BA was performed directly in water and the reaction conditions (10.0-mM 9-xanthydrol, 0.5-M HCl, 20-min reaction time, and ambient temperature) were established. Under these conditions, the detection limit of the analytes was 0.03 ug/L, and the interday relative standard deviation was less than 16% at concentrations of 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 ug/L. The proposed GC-MS method enables the reliable analysis of trace AA, PA, and BA in environmental water.",

Sample preparation is kept to a minimum, and the proposed analytical procedure proves to be fast, sensitive, and precise. Validation studies show good linearity with a regression coefficient of r2=.000 for both compounds. Quantitation limits are 32 ng/mL for acrylamide and 70 ng/mL for acetamide. In the particulate phase of mainstream smoke from the University of Kentucky Reference Cigarette 2R4F, 2.3 ug/cig acrylamide and 4.7 ug/cig acetamide are found; no acetamide and only .0074 ug/cig acrylamide is found in the gas phase. Possible mechanisms of formation in cigarette smoke are discussed.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

It is used as a solvent and stabilizer, accelerator in the estimation of bilirubin, antidote against monofluoroacetamide poisoning, and humectant for paper. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: There are no data available. ANIMAL STUDIES: When acetamide was administered at a concentration of 5% in the diet to 99 male rats, with 2 rats returned to a control diet each week, liver tumors were found after treatment for 14-40 weeks in 22/81 rats. Acetamide-treated rats developed neoplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinomas. The incidence, speed of onset, and frequency of metastases were greater in males than in females. Acetamide had the least toxic effects in regards to teratogenicity and embryotoxicity, compared to its derivatives. Acetamide produced morphological transformation in Syrian hamster embryo cells without  metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Acetamide exhibited a selective damaging action on Entosiphon sulcatum.",

Two weeks after injection, all of the rats were treated with 2 acetyl ainofluorene (AAF), 2 mg/kg bw, every other day for two weeks. One week after commencing the AAF treatment, partial hepatectomies were performed. Two weeks after finishing the AAF treatment, the rats were fed a diet containing 0.05% phenobarbital for two months, after which they were killed and their livers examined. A negative control group of five rats and a positive control group of four rats were included in which acetamide treatment was replaced by saline and N-nitrosodiethylamine (100 mg/kg bw) acetamide treatments, respectively. gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GT) positive foci occurred in 0/5, 5/12 and 12/12 rats of the negative control and the 100 and 400 mg/kg bw acetamide dosed groups, respectively. Precise quantitation of the foci was not possible. Livers with gamma-GT positive foci showed basophilia, lipidosis and periportal hypertrophy, while gamma-GT negative livers had normal morphology. It was concluded that acetamide shows properties in this system consistent with initiator activity.",

Acetamide has been detected near the center of the Milky Way galaxy, on the surface of a comet and as a mineral in waste piles of a coal shaft. Acetamide has been detected in the roots of sugar beets. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.0182 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates acetamide will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase acetamide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.6 days. Acetamide does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, acetamide is expected to have very high mobility based upon a Koc of 5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Acetamide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A 69% of theoretical BOD in 2 weeks in the Japanese MITI test and a 69% of theoretical degradation in a 10-day window of an OECD 301D Closed Bottle test indicate acetamide is readily biodegradable. Therefore biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process in soil and water. If released into water, acetamide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Aqueous hydrolysis studies demonstrate that acetamide will not hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to acetamide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where acetamide is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to acetamide via inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of over-oxidized wine and dermal contact with consumer products containing acetamide.

According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of -1.26(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A 69% of theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(8) and a 69% of theoretical degradation in a 10-day window of an OECD 301D Closed Bottle test(3) indicates that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

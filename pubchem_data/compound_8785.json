It is one of many compounds that is attractive to males of various species of orchid bees, who apparently gather the chemical to synthesize pheromones; it is commonly used as bait to attract and collect these bees for study.\n\nBenzyl acetate belongs to the family of Benzyloxycarbonyls. These are organic compounds containing a carbonyl group substituted with a benzyloxyl group.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Absorption of neat benzyl acetate through rat skin occluded with parafilm was 49.3 +/- 2.0% (mean +/- SD, n=4) after 48 hr. When benzyl acetate in ethanol was applied to the skin and the skin was occluded with parafilm, the extent of absorption at 48 hr was not significantly different from that after neat application. However at 6 hr, as the ethanol content of the application mixture was increased, the absorption of benzyl acetate through occluded skin was enhanced proportionally. When phenylethanol was used as a vehicle, the extent of the benzyl acetate absorption through occluded skin at 48 hr was enhanced (P less than 0.05) compared with that after application neat; with 50% (v/v) phenyl-ethanol, absorption at 48 hr was 56.3 +/- 4.9%. However, this enhanced absorption did not correlate with the proportion of phenylethanol in the application mixture. When dimethylsulphoxide was used as a vehicle, the extent of absorption of benzyl acetate through occluded skin at 48 hr was enhanced (P less than 0.05) compared with that after application neat (absorption was 59.3 +/- 3.7% of the applied dose when 50% (v/v) dimethylsulphoxide was used). As the dimethylsulphoxide content of the application mixture was increased, the absorption of benzyl acetate was enhanced proportionally. Occlusion of the skin surface with parafilm often significantly enhanced absorption (P less than 0.05), although the effect varied with time and vehicle. In general, the degree of any enhanced absorption caused by the use of a vehicle or occlusion of the skin was small, and, in most cases, would be unlikely to be toxicologically significant.",

Penetration of the compound through rat and human skin was evaluated in vitro in flow-through diffusion cells following topical application of neat [methylene-14C] benzyl acetate (33.1 mg/sq cm) to the epidermal surface and occlusion with a teflon cap, 2.9 cm above the skin surface. The absorption of benzyl acetate across rat skin was rapid and extensive, reaching 34.3 +/- 3.9% of the applied dose (11.3 +/- 1.3 mg/sq cm) (mean +/-SD, n=12) at 24 hr and 55.8 +/- 5.0% of the applied dose (18.5 +/- 1.7 mg/sq cm)at 72 hr. The penetration of benzyl acetate was significantly (P<0.05) less rapid and extensive through human skin, reaching 5.5 +/- 0.1% of the applied dose (1.8 +/- 0.0 mg/sq cm) (mean +/- SD, n=12) at 24 hr and 17.8 +/- 3.3% of the applied dose (5.9 +/-1.1 mg sq cm) at 72 hr. The rate of penetration of benzyl acetate was greater through rat skin than through human tissue at all time points studied up to 72 hr. The maximum rate of skin penetration was 0.6 +/- mg/sq cm/hr and 0.1 +/_- 0.0 mg/sq cm/hr through rat and human skin, respectively. These data indicate that systemic exposure to benzyl acetate may occur after skin contact in humans. They also support the evidence from the literature that human skin is generally less permeable to xenobiotics than rat skin.",

The doses used in this study were 5, 50, or 500 mg/kg for rats and 10, 100, or 1000 mg/kg for mice in single dose corn oil gavage administrations and 500 mg/kg for rats and 1000 mg/kg for mice daily five times per week for two weeks, also administered by gavage in corn oil. Most (90%) of the benzyl acetate-derived radioactivity was recovered in the urine and none was detected in the liver, blood, muscle, adipose tissue skin, lung, kidney, or stomach of treated rats or mice. The major metabolite isolated in the urine was hippuric acid (94%-99% of the dose). Other metabolites found were mercapturic acid and benzyl alcohol. Benzyl acetate was not detected in the urine of treated animals. Neither the size of the dose nor the frequency of dosing had any effect on the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of this compound. There was no evidence to indicate any saturation of this metabolizing capacity in either species over the range of doses studied.",

Benzyl acetate was rapidly hydrolyzed to benzyl alcohol and then oxidized to benzoic acid. After gavage administration of benzyl acetate in corn oil at 500 mg/kg (rats) and 1000 mg/kg(mice), high benzoic acid plasma concentrations were observed. In contrast, much lower benzoic acid plasma concentrations were found after dosed feed administration at about 615 mg/kg/day for rats and about 850 mg/kg/day for mice. Results show that although the daily doses of benzyl acetate are comparable, bolus gavage administration effectively saturated the benzoic acid elimination pathway whereas dosed feed administration did not. In contrast, hippuric acid plasma concentrations were similar after both gavage and dosed feed administration due to the depletion of the glycine supply pool. ...",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.

HUMAN EXPOSURE:  Benzyl acetate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, through the lungs and through intact skin. It is hydrolyzed in man to benzyl alcohol and acetate; the benzyl radical is oxidized to benzoic  acid and excreted as hippuric acid. ANIMAL/BACTERIAL STUDIES:  This compound is hydrolyzed in vitro with a pancreatin preparation. Benzylmercapturic acid and hippuric acid were  isolated from the urine of rats that had been injected sc with benzyl acetate. Mice and rats were dosed either iv or po with (14)C labeled benzyl acetate. Elimination of benzyl acetate as carbon dioxide or volatiles was minimal. The elimination of the (14)C label occurred mainly in  urine with less than 1% excreted in the feces. More than 90% of the (14)C in urine was present as hippuric acid with minor amounts present as benzyl alcohol. Neither route of administration or dose had any significant effect on the pattern of elimination. Groups of 5 B6C3F1 mice of each sex were dosed with benzyl acetate in corn oil by gavage daily for 14 days.  All male mice at the highest dose level had died by day 3 of the study. Weight changes were not dose related. At autopsy the only effect reported was a thickening of the mucosa of the stomach and in the cardiac region in two males and all females in the highest dose group and one female in the medium dose group. Groups of 50 male and female B6C3F1 mice were administered benzyl acetate in corn oil by gavage for 5 days/wk for  103 weeks. Vehicle control groups of 50 animals per sex were administered corn oil by gavage. The high mortality rate in female mice was associated with infection, resulting in inflammation or abcesses of the ovaries, uterus, mesentery, peritoneum or multiple organs.  There was no association of treatment with the reported incidences of hepatocellular and forestomach tumors after the administration of benz yl acetate. Groups of 50 male and female F344/N rats of each sex were administered benzyl acetate in corn oil 5 days/wk for 103 weeks. Vehicle control groups consisted of 50 animals per sex were administered corn oil by gavage. The incidence of all malignant epithelial tumors in the preputial gland of male rats was elevated in the high dose group. There was increased incidence of retinopathy and cataracts in the high dose males and low dose females. In mutagenicity tests using Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA98 with or without rat or hamster-9 activation results were  negative. In vitro mammalian cytogenicity  chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells produced a negative response, in presence or absence of induced rat liver S-9  fraction. In the mouse lymphoma cell assay, it was positive for mutagenicity when induced by metabolic activation and negative in the absence of activation. Bacterial gene mutation with Bacillus subtilus and unscheduled DNA synthesis in vitro and in vivo were both negative.[",

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

Benzyl acetate's production and use in artificial jasmine and other perfumes, as a flavoring, as a solvent may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.18 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzyl acetate is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzyl acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the estimated half-life for this reaction in air is 2.5 days. If released to soil, an estimated Koc of 280 suggests that benzyl acetate is expected to have moderate mobility. Volatilization from wet soil surfaces may be important based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation is expected to be an important process in both soil and water. Benzyl acetate reached 92 to 96% of its theoretical BOD over a period of 4 weeks. If released into water, the estimated Koc suggests that some adsorption of benzyl acetate to suspended solids and sediment in the water column is expected. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process given this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. The potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low based on this compound's estimated BCF of 18. An estimated hydrolysis half-life of 38 days at pH 7 suggests that hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process. Occupational exposure to benzyl acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzyl acetate is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to benzyl acetate via ingestion of food, and inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing benzyl acetate. (SRC)",

Benzyl acetate is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) from its experimental values for vapor pressure, 0.18 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 3.1X10+3 mg/l(5). Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.1 and 34 days, respectively(3,SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 18(3,SRC), from a log Kow(2), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Benzyl acetate is expected to biodegrade in aquatic systems(SRC); benzyl acetate reached 92 to 96% of its theoretical BOD over a period of 4 weeks(5). An estimated hydrolysis half-life of 38 days at pH 7(7), indicates hydrolysis may be an important process(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2.5 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1,SRC). A hydrolysis half-life of 38 days at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7 was calculated for benzyl acetate from an estimated pseudo-first-order hydrolysis rate constant of 2.1X10-7/s(2). The UV spectrum of benzyl acetate in methanol indicates no absorption above 290 nm, suggesting this compound is not expected to directly photolyze(3). Photolysis of benzyl acetate in t-butanol with 1.3 mol/l acetone added as a sensitizer at 300 nm produced (quantum yields) t-butyl benzyl ether (<0.01) and bibenzyl (<0.01)(4). The rate constant for the reaction of benzyl acetate with peroxy radicals in water at 30 \u00b0C was determined to be 2.3 L/mol s(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

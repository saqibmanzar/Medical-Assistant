During work, there were occasional spills of the monomer which could come in contact with the hands and arms of the worker. After 2 weeks of employment, the patient developed blisters and edema of the back of her hands, forearms, knees and thighs that required hospitalization and treatment. Although the irritant nature of the monomer was known, the workers had difficulties working with gloves and protective clothing. Patch tests carried out in ten volunteers with a 1 percent solution of diallylgycol carbonate confirmed the irritant nature of the product, in the form of a minimal or mild edema, with no vesicular reactions. Patch testing carried out in the patient to rule out the possibility of an allergic contact dermatitis revealed that she was highly sensitive to diallylgycol carbonate, a positive reaction being recorded at a concentration as low as 0.001 percent. The authors conclude that the patient developed an allergic contact dermatitis to diallylgycol carbonate, although the product is also a skin irritant.",

Seven high-dose does died or were killed in extremis GD 7, 8, 20, 21, and 22, having exhibited poor appetite, labored respiration, weakness, thinness, coldness, prostration, and/or yellow nasal discharge. All treated groups showed red/black areas of dose-related extent, sometimes with red secretions, at dosage sites during treatment which scabbed later. Other clinical effects were reddening of the dorsal cervical region and pinna (high dose) and reddening or swelling in the uro-genital area (mid and high dose). Food consumption and fecal output increased (dose-related) in mid and high dose groups. Mid and high dose groups lost weight GD 6-18, high dose losses continuing GD 18-24. Necropsy showed pale foci in liver (and/or firmness and/or irregular surface), heart, kidneys, and mesentery in mid and high dose groups. Stomach lesions were in all groups, especially high dose; 4 does had dark ingesta. Abortions or early deliveries in 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 ml/kg groups were 2, 3, 2, and 8, respectively. In low or mid dose groups, number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live and dead fetuses, resorptions, fetal and litter weights, uterine weights, and pre- and post-implantation losses were similar to controls for does alive on GD 29. Does that died, littered early, or aborted had resorptions in aborta or in utero. Fetuses in mid (p<0.01) and high (p<0.001) dose groups had significantly higher incidence of small lenses, with ocular opacities in high dose groups. Major or minor visceral malformations were similar to controls. Skeletal variants included significant (p<0.05) decrease in single thirteenth ribs, and an increase in incidence of 27 presacral vertebrae (mid dose).",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Alkylation of DNA by alkylbromides may also lead to mutations. 2-bromopropane triggers the mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic pathway via ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation. 2-bromopropane has also been shown to induce DNA damage, impair functional antioxidant cellular defenses, and enhance the lipid peroxidation in cultured Leydig cells.",

We followed their clinical course for 2 years and found that two patients recovered normal ovarian function spontaneously: one became pregnant and delivered a normal full-term baby, and the other resumed regular menstrual periods with normal hormonal values. Our observations support the idea that the increasing prevalence of ovarian failure in recent years might be due to an increase in presently unidentified environmental toxic agents.",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 216 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isopropyl bromide will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase isopropyl bromide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 days. If released to soil, isopropyl bromide is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 350. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.011 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilization of isopropyl bromide from dry soil surfaces exists based upon its extrapolated vapor pressure. An aqueous screening study using an activated sludge indicated that isopropyl bromide is readily biodegradable. If released into water, isopropyl bromide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 4 days, respectively. The hydrolysis half-life of isopropyl bromide was reported as 2.1 days at 25 \u00b0C (pH 7). An estimated BCF of 9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to isopropyl bromide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isopropyl bromide is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

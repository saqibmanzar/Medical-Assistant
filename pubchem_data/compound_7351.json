When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is released directly to the atmosphere by evaporation through its use as a solvent in lacquers, thinners and other coating compositions. If released to the atmosphere, it will degrade by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of 3.4 days). If released to soil or water, 2-methylpropyl isobutyrate is expected to degrade via biodegradation. Aqueous hydrolysis will be important only in very alkaline environmental media (pH > 8.5). 2-Methylpropyl isobutyrate may leach readily in soils based upon an estimated Koc of 98; however, the importance of leaching will be lessened if rapid biodegradation occurs. Evaporation from solid surfaces will be an important physical transport mechanism to air. The general population is exposed to 2-methylpropyl isobutyrate through oral consumption since it occurs naturally in some fruits. Inhalation exposure will occur from its use as a solvent. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep flowing 1 m/sec with a wind velocity of 3 m/sec) can be estimated to be about 4.8 hours(3,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model environmental pond (2 meters deep) can be estimated to be about 3 days(4,SRC). 2-Methylpropyl isobutyrate has a relatively high vapor pressure(2) which suggests that evaporation from dry surfaces will occur(SRC).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Commercial products are generally mixtures of several congeners and range from thin liquids to hard waxes to high melting point solids. Their main uses have been in cable insulation, wood preservation, engine oil additives, electroplating masking compounds, capacitors and refractive index testing oils and as a feedstock for dye production. HUMAN EXPOSURE: The major sources of release of chlorinated naphthalenes into the environment are likely from waste incineration and disposal of items containing chlorinated naphthalenes to landfill. In the past, chlorinated naphthalene concn of up to 14.5 mg/cu m have been measured in the workplace, while levels of 25-2900 ng/cu m have been recorded in out door air in vicinity of manufacturing sites. More recently, monitoring studies have revealed chlorinated naphthalene concn up to 150 pg/cu m at semirural sites and 1-40 pg/cu m at remote sites. A single study on chlorinated tap water revealed 0.44 ng monochloronaphthalene/l. Chlorinated naphthalenes can be absorbed via oral, inhalative and dermal routes, with absorption and distribution over the whole body after oral admin. Chlorinated naphthalenes, especially the dioxin-like congeners, have been detected in adipose tissue, liver, blood and breast milk samples from the general population at concn in the ng/kg lipid range. Severe skin reactions (chloracne) and liver disease have been reported after occupational exposure to chlorinated naphthalenes. Chloracne was common among workers who handling chlorinated naphthalenes in the 1930's to 1940's. A cohort study on workers exposed to chlorinated naphthalenes at a cable manufacturing plant found an excess of deaths from cirrhosis of the liver. However, individuals with chloracne did not show a higher mortality due to liver cirrhosis compared with other workers. The mortality from all cancers was slightly but significantly elevated among all exposed men (standardized mortality ratio =1.18), but was not more elevated in the subcohort with chloracne. This subcohort showed statistically significant excess mortality from cancer of the esophagus and from benign and unspecified neoplasms. Symptoms described in workers exposed to chlorinated naphthalenes included irritation of the eyes, fatigue, headache, anemia, hematuria, impotency, anorexia, vomiting and severe abdominal pain. ANIMAL STUDIES: Chlorinated naphthalenes have been shown to be highly bioaccumulative in fish, but less so in shrimp and algae. The amount of bioaccumulation observed incr with the degree of chlorination of the chlorinated naphthalenes. The most highly chlorinated naphthalenes do not appear to bioaccumulate. Monochloronaphthalenes appear to be readily degradable by soil and water microorganisms under aerobic conditions. Chlorinated naphthalene concn in fish range up to a maximum of around 300 ug/kg lipid weight. Monitoring studies with seabird eggs have revealed a decr in chlorinated naphthalene levels between 1974 and 1987. Hydroxy metabolites have been identified mostly for the lower chlorinated naphthalenes (mono- to tetra-) in experimental animals. There are also preliminary indications for the occurrence of methylthio- or methyl sulfoxide chloronaphthalene metabolites in the feces of rats. Elimination of the parent compounds and/or metabolites occurs via feces and urine. The higher chlorinated congeners appeared to be more toxic than the lower chlorinated ones. Long term and carcinogenicity studies with chlorinated naphthalenes have not been performed. 1-Monochloronaphthalene was not mutagenic in the Salmonella Ames test. Like related cmpd, chlorinated naphthalenes have been demonstrated to be inducers of the cytochrome p450 (CYP) dependent microsomal enzymes. Chlorinated naphthalenes were also found to change lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities in rats in a manner indicative of oxidative stress. At least some of the biological and toxic responses of chlorinated naphthalenes are believed to be mediated via the cytosolic Ah receptor, resembling those of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related cmpd. All chlorinated naphthalenes tested cause skin irritations in laboratory animals. Chlorinated napthalenes appear to be of moderate to high acute toxicity to aquatic organisms. /Chlorinated naphthalenes, Monochloronaphthalenes/",

Both the Halowax mixture and the hexachloronaphthalene preparation showed hyperkeratotic activity at the applied concentration of 30 mg/g acetone (corresponding to 23.7 mg/day per ear), but the mono- and dichloronaphthalenes did not at concentrations of up to 590 and 290 mg/g acetone, respectively. The monochloronaphthalene (at 90 mg/g acetone) and dichloronaphthalene (at 45 mg/g acetone) congeners produced only very slight erythema without follicular accentuation and, histologically, a minimal inflammation. At the higher concentrations (590 and 290 mg/g acetone, respectively), severe primary irritant dermatitis resulted within 24 hr following a single application; histologically, severe inflammation was seen without sebaceous gland decrease, lysis, and necrosis.",

Both the Halowax mixture and the hexachloronaphthalene preparation showed hyperkeratotic activity at the applied concentration of 30 mg/g acetone (corresponding to 23.7 mg/day per ear), but the mono- and dichloronaphthalenes did not at concentrations of up to 590 and 290 mg/g acetone, respectively. The monochloronaphthalene (at 90 mg/g acetone) and dichloronaphthalene (at 45 mg/g acetone) congeners produced only very slight erythema without follicular accentuation and, histologically, a minimal inflammation. At the higher concentrations (590 and 290 mg/g acetone, respectively), severe primary irritant dermatitis resulted within 24 hr following a single application; histologically, severe inflammation was seen without sebaceous gland decrease, lysis, and necrosis.",

Parameters examined included mortality, body and organ weight changes, food consumption, clinical signs, opthalmologic changes, hematology, clinical chemistry, and gross histopathology. Mortality was reported in one male and one female low- dose mice and in three male and two female high-dose mice, although no statistical significance was found when compared with controls. Daily observations revealed dyspnea, rough hair coat, and languid, thin, hunched appearance of high-dose animals; these signs were more prevalent among females than males. Similar symptoms were also observed in other treatment groups, but the incidence was not statistically significant. Although total food consumption was significantly increased in high-dose males throughout the study, this did not result in a significant increase in body weight gain, compared with controls. Absolute and relative liver and gall bladder weights were significantly increased in both sexes at the high-dose level and were accompanied by centrilobular hepatocellular enlargement. Both absolute and relative adrenal weights were significantly increased in low-dose females, but no dose-response relationship could be established, nor was there any corresponding histopathologic changes. No other effects were observed. The LOAEL was identified as 600 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 250 mg/kg/day.",

The sole U.S. producer ceased manufacturing chloronaphthalene products in 1977. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.0122 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-chloronaphthalene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-chloronaphthalene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.1 days. 2-Chloronaphthalene absorbs light with wavelengths >290 nm, and may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-chloronaphthalene is expected to have slight mobility based upon estimated Koc value of 3000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.00032 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. 2-Chloronaphthalene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation half-lives were 59 and 79 days for 2-chloronaphthalene contained in a mixture of oil sludge that was added to soil columns along with nitrogen and phosphorus. If released into water, 2-chloronaphthalene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.2 hours and 6.1 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. A BCF of 4300 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. The hydrolysis of 2-chloronaphthalene is not environmentally important. The neutral rate constant for the hydrolysis of 2-chloronaphthalene in water at 25 \u00b0C is 9.5X10-6 hr-1, which corresponds to a half-life of 8.3 years. Occupational exposure to 2-chloronaphthalene may have occurred through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-chloronaphthalene was produced or used. Municipal waste incinerators can emit 2-chloronaphthalene to ambient air. 2-Chloronaphthalene may be formed as a product of chlorination during water treatment and therefore, it may be released in cooling water discharges and to drinking water supplies. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-chloronaphthalene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.00032 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.2 hours and 6.1 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 38 days if adsorption is considered(7). According to a classification scheme(5), a BCF of 4300(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). A number of aerobic biological screening studies, which utilized settled waste water, sewage, or activated sludge for inocula, have demonstrated that 2-chloronaphthalene should biodegrade slowly in aquatic systems(8-11). The hydrolysis of 2-chloronaphthalene is not environmentally important(12). The neutral rate constant for the hydrolysis of 2-chloronaphthalene in water at 25 \u00b0C is 9.5X10-6, which corresponds to a half-life of 8.3 years(12).",

The Bunch and Chambers static culture flask biodegradability screening test was performed on 114 organic priority pollutants included on the U.S. EPA Priority Pollutants list under a set of controlled experimental conditions that included the following parameters: 5 and 10 mg/l concentrations of the test compound, 5 mg/l of yeast extract in the synthetic medium, 7-day static incubation at 25 \u00b0C in the dark followed by three weekly subcultures (totaling 28 days of incubation), and incorporating settled domestic wastewater as the microbial inoculum. With respect to 2-chloronaphthalene, 100 percent loss of compound was observed after the first 7 day inoculation period and after each subsequent subculture. The results indicated significant biodegradation with rapid adaptation(1).",

A Warburg test, using a microbial population of 1900 mg/l, activated sewage sludge acclimated to naphthalene, resulted in an 18% BODT of 1 ppm 2-chloronaphthalene in less than 10 hr; while 400 ug of O2 was utilized(1). According to the Japanese MITI procedure, which also utilized activated sludge as inocula, a microbial population concn of 30 mg/l degraded between 0 to 29% of 100 ppm 2-chloronaphthalene after 14 days incubation at 25 \u00b0C with a pH of 7(2). A soil column study also indicates that 2-chloronaphthalene will biodegrade slowly(3). In 56 days, 757 mg/kg of 2-chloronaphthalene in a mixture of oil sludge degraded to 470 mg/kg in a Derby soil column with nitrogen and phosphorous additions(3). After 76 days the final concn was 94 mg/kg(3). In 102 days, 960 mg/kg of 2-chloronaphthalene in a wood preserving sludge degraded to 393 mg/kg in a Derby soil column with nitrogen and phosphorous additions(3). After 287 days the final concn was 15 mg/kg(3). The succeeding first order rate constants are 0.0805 and 0.0170 day-1; which correspond to half-lives of 59 and 79 days for 2-chloronaphthalene(3).",

The neutral rate constant for the hydrolysis of 2-chloronaphthalene in water at 25 \u00b0C is 9.5X10-6 hr-1, which corresponds to a half-life of 8.3 years(1). Data regarding direct photolysis of 2-chloronaphthalene in air or water were not located in the available literature. 2-Chloronaphthalene does absorb UV light in the environmentally relevant range (greater than 290 nm) with lambda max in methanol of 307 and 321 nm(2). Therefore, 2-chloronaphthalene has the potential to undergo photolysis in the environment. The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 2-chloronaphthalene with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals has been estimated to be 1.65X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C; which corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 23 hours at an atmospheric concn of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

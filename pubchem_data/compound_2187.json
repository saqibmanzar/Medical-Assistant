Aromatase inhibitors, including anastrozole, have become endocrine drugs of choice in the treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer due to a more favourable efficacy and adverse effect profile as compared to earlier estrogen receptor modulators such as [tamoxifen].  Anastrozole was first approved for use in the United States in 1995.",

In estrogen-dependent breast cancers, ananstrozole may inhibit tumor growth. (NCI04)",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

As the growth of many breast cancers is stimulated and/or maintained by the presence of estrogen, anastrozole helps to treat these cancers by decreasing the levels of circulating estrogens. Anastrozole has a relatively long duration of action allowing for once daily dosing - serum estradiol is reduced by approximately 70% within 24 hours of beginning therapy with 1mg once daily, and levels remain suppressed for up to 6 days following cessation of therapy.   The incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events was increased during anastrozole therapy and patients with pre-existing ischemic heart disease should consider the risks and benefits of anastrozole before beginning therapy. Anastrozole has also been reported to decrease spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD), so consideration should be given to monitoring of BMD in patients receiving long-term therapy.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

In volunteers with severe renal impairment, renal clearance was reduced by 50% while total clearance was only reduced by approximately 10%.",

Anastrozole may also undergo N-dealkylation to form triazole and 3,5-Bis-(2-methylpropiononitrile)-benzoic acid. Labels for anastrozole state the main metabolite found in plasma following administration is triazole, but a recent pharmacokinetic study was unable to detect any products of N-dealkylation _in vitro_.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Many breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive, meaning their growth is stimulated and/or maintained by the presence of hormones such as estrogen or progesterone. In postmenopausal women, estrogen is primarily derived from the conversion of adrenally-produced androgens into estrogens by the aromatase enzyme - by competitively inhibiting the biosynthesis of estrogen at these enzymes, anastrozole effectively suppresses circulating estrogen levels and, subsequently, the growth of hormone receptor-positive tumours.",

Anastrozole selectively inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens. In postmenopausal women, ovarian secretion of estrogen declines and conversion of adrenal androgens (mainly androstenedione and testosterone) to estrone and estradiol in peripheral tissues (adipose, muscle, and liver), catalyzed by the aromatase enzyme, is the principal source of estrogens. Anastrozole inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the heme of the cytochrome P-450 unit of the enzyme; suppression of estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues reduces serum concentrations of circulating estrogens, including estrone, estradiol, and estrone sulfate. Anastrozole selectively inhibits synthesis of estrogens and does not affect synthesis of adrenal corticosteroid, aldosterone, or thyroid hormone. In animals, anastrozole has not been shown to possess direct progestogenic, androgenic, or estrogenic activity, but alterations in the circulating concentrations of progesterone, androgens, and estrogens have been observed.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

The principal source of circulating estrogen (primarily estradiol) is conversion of adrenally-generated androstenedione to estrone by aromatase in peripheral tissues. Therefore, aromatase inhibition leads to a decrease in serum and tumor concentration of estrogen, leading to a decreased tumor mass or delayed progression of tumor growth in some women. Anastrozole has no detectable effect on synthesis of adrenal corticosteroids, aldosterone, and thyroid hormone. Organic nitriles decompose into cyanide ions both in vivo and in vitro. Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

There have been rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury associated with anastrozole therapy, typically arising within 1 to 4 months of starting treatment and having variable presentations but generally with a hepatocellular or mixed serum enzyme pattern (Case 1). Too few instances have been described in the literature to provide specific characteristics or clinical phenotype. Immunoallergic features (fever, rash, eosinophilia) were not mentioned in published cases, but low levels of autoantibodies were sometimes found. Recovery is usually rapid once anastrozole is stopped. There have been no cases of acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis or vanishing bile duct syndrome attributed to anastrozole use. Unlike tamoxifen, anastrozole has not been associated with development of fatty liver disease, although some degree of steatosis and steatohepatitis have been mentioned in descriptions of liver biopsies from acute cases. According to the product label, anastrozole has been linked to cases of hypersensitivity reactions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome as well as cases of hepatitis with jaundice.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

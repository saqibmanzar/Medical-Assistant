When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Based on its evaluation of ADBAC, the Agency has determined that ADBAC products, unless labeled and used as specified in this document, would present risks inconsistent with FIFRA. Accordingly, should a registrant fail to implement the risk mitigation measure identified in this document, the Agency may take regulatory action to address the risk concerns from the use of ADBAC. If all changes outlined in this document are incorporated into the product labels, then all current risks for ADBAC will be substantially mitigated for the purposes of this determination. Once an Endangered Species assessment is completed, further changes to these registrations may be necessary as explained in Section III of this document."

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.6X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 9X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation is the ultimate fate of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) released to wastewater treatment and the environment. If released into water, tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test and a mixture of decyl-, dodecyl- and tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation can be slow. Another MITI study reported a degradation of 83% in 10 days. Acclimation may be a major factor that influences biodegradation of QACs. Greater than 70% removal of 20 mg/L tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride was observed using a continuous-flow activated sludge system in a wastewater treatment plant. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF range of <0.2-8.6 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where  tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to tetradecylbenzyldimethlammonium chloride through the use of consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 3.6X10-10 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2). Biodegradation is the ultimate fate of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) released to wastewater treatment and the environment(3). Reported biodegradation measurements of QACs have varied from 0-100%, but some reported values may not distinguish between actual biodegradation, sorption and complexation mechanisms(3). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test and a mixture of decyl-, dodecyl- and tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks(4) indicating that biodegradation can be slow. Another MITI study reported a degradation of 83% in 10 days(5). Acclimation may be a major factor that influences biodegradation of QACs(3). Greater than 70% removal of 20 mg/L tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride was observed using a continuous-flow activated sludge system in a wastewater treatment plant(3).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). According to a classification scheme(4), a BCF range of <0.2-8.6 measured in carp (Cyprinus carpio)(5), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Biodegradation is the ultimate fate of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) released to wastewater treatment and the environment(6). Reported biodegradation measurements of QACs have varied from 0-100%, but some reported values may not distinguish between actual biodegradation, sorption and complexation mechanisms(6). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test and a mixture of decyl-, dodecyl- and tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks(5) indicating that biodegradation can be slow. Another MITI study reported a degradation of 83% in 10 days(7). Acclimation may be a major factor that influences biodegradation of QACs(6). Greater than 70% removal of 20 mg/L tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride was observed using a continuous-flow activated sludge system in a wastewater treatment plant(6). Tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

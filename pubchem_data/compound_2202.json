Adverse effects of anthralin include irritation and discoloration of the skin.  This specific property of the molecule inspired workers to study details of its pharmacology. It is important to consider that the drug is relatively innocuous, yet effective, and systemic side effects have not been observed with this anthralin, in contrast to a wide variety of systemic and topical therapies for psoriasis.   Anthralin is also known as dithranol.  It is a main active ingredient in topical skin formulations for the treatment of psoriasis. Various formulations of the drug are available, including solutions, foams, and shampoos. The chemical structure of anthralin allows for dual solubility, permitting the compound to be absorbed well through the epidermis.   Anthralin has also been studied in the treatment of warts, showing promising results. Salicylic acid is frequently added to anthralin to augment the stability of anthralin and to increase its penetration and efficacy.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

It is calculated as the sum of the mass of each constituent atom multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula.  The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In addition, the production of free radicals may contribute to its anti-psoriatic effect. In vitro studies demonstrate that anthralin prolongs the prophase component of mitosis for keratinocytes and leukocytes.  Prophase is the first step of mitosis, the process separating the duplicated genetic material carried in the nucleus of a parent cell into two identical daughter cells. In vivo studies demonstrate that anthralin blocks DNA synthesis and can increase the release of reactive oxygen species.  Anthralin is believed to normalize the rate of epidermal cell proliferation and keratinization by reducing the mitotic activity of the epidermal hyperplasia in psoriasis.   Anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of anthralin have been demonstrated on both psoriatic and healthy skin. The anti-proliferative effects of anthralin are thought to be due to a combination of inhibition of DNA synthesis and its strong reducing properties. The effectiveness of anthralin as an anti-psoriatic agent is partly owed to its ability to promote lipid peroxidation and reduce the concentration of endothelial adhesion molecules, which are found to be elevated in psoriatic patients,.  Recent studies suggest that its ability to prevent T-lymphocyte activation and normalize keratinocyte differentiation may occur by a direct effect on mitochondria.",

Be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital if advised by a physician. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

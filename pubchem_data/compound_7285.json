When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Unchanged TCP and total radiolabel were determined in tissues and excreta at varying intervals after administration. The compound was distributed and eliminated rapidly ... Adipose tissue accumulated 37% of the dose within 15 min and retained more of the dose than any other tissue until 4 hr; most (69%) of the radiolabel in adipose tissue through 4 hr was unchanged TCP. After 4 hr, the liver contained the largest fraction of the dose, primarily as metabolites. Thus TCP disappeared from adipose tissue while metabolites appeared in liver and other tissues. Excretion was nearly complete (90% of the dose) in 24 hr and was predominantly via the urine (47% of the dose). Expiration was the only route by which unchanged TCP (5% of the dose) was excreted. In addition, 25% of the dose was expired as carbon dioxide. There were numerous other metabolites, none accounting for more than 10% of the dose. Nonvolatile metabolites were longer lived than the parent compound. On the basis of high water solubility, reaction with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene, and diminished radiolabel in bile of glycidol-treated rats, glutathione conjugation is suggested as an important metabolic route for TCP ...",

Following acute oral exposure of male and female F344 rats (30 mg/kg) and male B6C3F1 mice (30 and 60 mg/kg), 1,2,3-trichloropropane was rapidly absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. The major route of excretion of 1,2,3-trichloropropane was in the urine. By 60 hr postdosing, rats had excreted 50% and mice 65% of the administered dose by this route. Exhalation as (14)C02 and excretion in the feces each accounted for 20% of the total dose in 60 hr rats and 20 and 15%, respectively, in mice. No apparent sex-related differences were observed in the ability of the rats to excrete 1,2,3-trichloropropane derived radioactivity. At 60 hr, 1,2,3-trichloropropane derived radioactivity was most concentrated in the liver, kidney, and forestomach in both rats and male mice. Male mice eliminated 1,2,3-trichloropropane derived radioactivity more rapidly than rats and lower concentrations of radioactivity were found in tissues 60 hr after dosing in mice. ...",

The extent of covalent binding to hepatic protein, DNA, and RNA was 418, 244, and 432 pmol [(14)C]TCP equivalents/mg, respectively. An in vivo covalent binding time course showed no significant change in [(14)C]TCP equivalents bound to hepatic DNA (1-48 hr), while binding to protein was maximal by 4 hr and decreased significantly by 48 hr. The binding of TCP-associated radioactivity to hepatic protein and DNA was shown to be cumulative for two and three doses when given 24 hr apart. Pretreatment of animals with phenobarbital caused a decrease while pretreatment with SKF 525-A caused an increase in covalent binding of [(14)C]TCP equivalents to protein and DNA. Pretreatment of rats with beta-naphthoflavone did not alter the covalent binding of [(14)C]TCP equivalents to protein or DNA. However, glutathione depletion with L-buthionine-(R,S)-sulfoximine increased binding to protein by 342% while it decreased binding to DNA by 56%. Intraperitoneal administration of TCP also depleted hepatic GSH by 41 and 61% 2 hr after doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg. The in vivo binding data suggest a dual role for GSH in the bioactivation of TCP. It may, in part, be that GSH is involved in the bioactivation and covalent binding of TCP to hepatic DNA. However, it also appears to detoxify a reactive intermediate(s) that binds to protein.",

The presence of DCA in microsomal incubations was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. DCA formation was totally dependent on the presence of NADPH. The rate of DCA formation using rat and human microsomes was 0.268 +/- 0.029 and 0.026 +/- 0.006 nmol/min/mg protein +/- SE, respectively. When hepatic microsomes were isolated from rats pretreated with the cytochrome P-450 inducers, phenobarbital, and dexamethasone, 24- and 2.5-fold increases, respectively, in the rate of DCA production, were observed. Pretreatment with beta-naphthoflavone resulted in a 50% inhibition in DCA formation. The inhibitors of cytochromes P-450, SKF 525-A and 1-aminobenzotriazol, produced 85 and 70% inhibitions of DCA formation, respectively. When alcohol dehydrogenase and NADH were added to microsomal incubations, two TCP-related alcohols, 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol and 2,3-dichloropropanol, were formed. These alcohols are products of the initial microsomal metabolites, DCA and 2,3-dichloropropanal. [14C]TCP equivalents bound covalently to rat hepatic microsomal protein. This binding was increased 8-fold when hepatic microsomes from phenobarbital pretreated rats were used. The addition of either glutathione or N-acetylcysteine to the incubations completely inhibited this binding. In the presence of N-acetylcysteine, 1,3-(2-propanone)-bis-S-(N-acetylcysteine) (PDM) was the only N-acetylcysteine conjugate detected. It represented 87% of TCP microsomal metabolism. The formation of PDM implicates DCA as the major microsomal protein-binding metabolite of TCP. The formation of DCA, a direct-acting mutagen, may be responsible for the mutagenicity of TCP in systems using rat hepatic microsomes ...",

The postulated formation of alkylating species is consistent with the presence of covalently bound radioactivity in liver and kidney and in target tissues of carcinogenic action after gavage administration of [(14)C]1,2,3-trichloropropane. Significant DNA adduct levels (as (14)C equivalents of 1,2,3-trichloropropane) were found in forestomach and liver in mice and in kidney, liver, pancreas, tongue, and forestomach in rats. A predominant role was assigned to episulfonium ions formed in situ during the metabolism of 1,2,3-trichloropropane in the liver and from processing of GSH conjugates of 1,2,3-trichloropropane in the kidney, leading to hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic lesions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

According to these investigations, analysis of ras mutations in forestomach tumors of mice from the NTP (1993) study showed that the observed mutations are not consistent with the miscoding properties of the major DNA adduct S-[l-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(N(7)-guanyl)ethyl]glutathione that had formerly been identified in various tissues by the same working group. Preliminary studies suggested that 1,2,3-trichloropropane administration produced increases in the etheno DNA adducts 1,N(6)-ethenodeoxyadenosine and 3,N(4)-ethenodeoxycytidine, which are thought to arise endogenously from lipid oxidation. The resulting alternative hypothesis for the formation of forestomach tumors is an indirect mutagenic effect of 1,2,3-trichloropropane by GSH depletion as a consequence of the bolus application by gavage, which may induce lipid oxidation. Consequently, GSH plays a crucial role in adduct formation, being involved both in the formation of the major DNA adduct S-[l-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(N(7)-guanyl)ethyl]glutathione and in the initiation of lipid oxidation.",

Toxic by inhalation and dermal contact, exposure to this colorless to straw colored acrid smelling liquid may occur from its use as a crosslinking agent in the synthesis of polysulfides, in the synthesis of hexafluoropropylene, as a paint and varnish remover, solvent and degreasing agent. Effects from exposure may include eye and throat irritation. The ACGIH TLV has been set at a TWA of 10 ppm. OSHA has set a PEL of 10 ppm (TWA) to become effective December 31, 1992. Local exhaust ventilation should be used to control exposure. However, in activities where over exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and personal protective clothing, including gloves, boots and bands around the legs and arms, so that no skin surface is exposed. If contact should occur, wash immediately with soap and remove nonimpervious clothing if contaminated. 1,2,3-Trichloropropane must be moderately heated before ignition will occur (flashpoint: 180 \u00b0F open cup). For fires involving 1,2,3-trichloropropane, extinguish with dry chemical, or water (as a blanket, spray, or mist). 1,2,3-Trichloropropane should be stored in a cool, well ventilated place, out of direct rays of the sun, and away from flames, sparks, active metals, strong caustics, and strong oxidizers. For spills of 1,2,3-trichloropropane, first ventilate the area, then absorb the spill with vermiculite, dry sand, or earth, and collect for reclamation disposal, or incineration. Before implementing land disposal of waste 1,2,3-trichloropropane, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

Do not reenter the contaminated area until the Safety Officer (or other responsible person) has verified that the area has been properly cleaned.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

It is used as an intermediate in the synthesis of other chemicals (e.g., pesticides) and as a crosslinking agent in the production of polymers, such as polysulfides and hexafluoropropylene. Former uses include a solvent for hydrophobic compounds and resins, as a paint and varnish remover, and as a degreasing agent. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Vapors of 1,2,3-trichloropropane were found to be objectionable to subjects at a concentration of 100 ppm because of eye and throat irritation and unpleasant odor. It was noted that vapors of 1,2,3-TCP were acrid at 50 ppm. Acute/subchronic neurotoxic effects of 1,2,3-TCP include CNS damage in humans. Sporadic cases of toxic hepatic injury from 1,2,3-TCP in humans have been reported. In an in vitro micronucleus assay, 1,2,3-TCP did not exhibit mutagenic activity compared to the concurrent control. The DNA breakage capacity and the cytotoxicity was assessed in the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis test (comet assay) with and without S9-mix in isolated human lymphocytes. 1,2,3-TCP induced DNA breakage. 1,2,3-TCP is a suspected human carcinogen. ANIMAL STUDIES: A dose of 0.5 mL of 1,2,3-TCP applied to the intact skin of rabbits for 4 hr under semi-occlusive and for 24 hr under occlusive dressings produced mild reversible irritation. In contrast to these test results, another study classified 1,2,3-TCP as severely irritating, based on irritation scores from a Draize test on intact and abraded skin of rabbits. After instillation of 0.1 mL of undiluted 1,2,3-TCP, mild to moderate irritation of rabbit eyes was observed, with all effects being reversible within 2-7 days. Symptoms of intoxication in rats and mice included prostration, hypoactivity, ataxia, sedation, dyspnea, convulsions, lacrimation, salivation, irritation of the mucosa of eyes and nose, and liver and kidney damage. Immediate respiratory depression was a frequent cause of death. Delayed deaths (after 7-10 days) were ascribed to liver damage. Three dogs that received intragastic administration of 1,2,3-TCP had CNS depression, within 1-2 hours, and died within 1-2 days. Continuous inhalation of 0.4 and 0.8 mg/cu m of 1,2,3-TCP for 7 days caused hemorrhages in rat lungs with desquamation and destruction of bronchial, bronchiolar & alveolar epithelium. Rats given 113 or 149 mg/kg 1,2,3-TCP in drinking water for 13 weeks developed renal pyknosis, glomerular adhesions, and accumulated protein in the tubular lumen. Intermittent 4-hour exposures for 11 days at 3 ppm of 1,2,3-TCP caused a decreased thickness of olfactory epithelium in rats. A degeneration of the olfactory epithelium was found in rats at 10 ppm or higher concentrations, and inflammation and decreased thickness of the olfactory epithelium were found in mice at 10 to 13 ppm with degeneration at higher concentrations.  Among 140 carcinogenic chemicals tested in long-term animal studies, 1,2,3-TCP was among the seven producing uterine neoplasms in mice (spontaneous tumor rate 0.3%). 1,2,3-TCP was evaluated in 2-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies by the NTP. 1,2,3-TCP induced benign and/or malignant neoplasms at multiple sites in both rats and mice. 15 daily doses of 37 mg/kg 1,2,3-TCP were given by intraperitoneal injection to pregnant rats throughout implantation and organogenesis; there were no fetotoxic or teratogenic effects in the offspring, but maternal toxicity was evident. Male rats given five oral doses of 80 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of testicular toxicity. In a one-generation reproduction study, progeny indices were unaffected by treatment with 1,2,3-TCP. Male rats administered 1,2,3-TCP by gavage at a dosage of 125 mg/kg body weight per day for 120 days showed significant increases in relative testes weights and a significant decrease in relative epididymis weight. However, no effects on sperm count or sperm morphology and no histomorphological changes of testes or epididymis were observed. Impairment of survival rates was observed among pups of treated females that had been mated with untreated males.  1,2,3-TCP is mutagenic in bacterial test systems with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 97, TA 100, and TA 1535 and E. coli WP2 uvr A in the presence of metabolic activation.  1,2,3-TCP did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes. It induced gene mutation at the thymidine kinase locus in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, sister chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster V79 and ovary cells and chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, only in the presence of metabolic activation. Additionally, 1,2,3-TCP enhanced the transformation of Syrian hamster embryo cells by simian adenovirus SA7.",

There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of 1,2,3-trichloropropane. Overall evaluation: 1,2,3-Trichloropropane is probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A). In making the overall evaluation, the working group took into account the following evidence: (1) 1,2,3-Trichloropropane causes tumors at multiple sites and at high incidence in mice and rats. (2) The metabolism of 1,2,3-trichloropropane is qualitatively similar in human and rodent microsomes. (3) 1,2,3-Trichloropropane is mutagenic to bacteria and to cultured mammalian cells and binds to the DNA of animals treated in vivo.",

Here, a 45-year-old farmer who suffered fulminant hepatic failure due to ingestion of 1,2,3-trichloropropane has been reported and literature about 1,2,3-trichloropane poisoning has been reviewed. For this case, reduced glutathione, vitamin K, pantoprazole were infused intravenously, and transfusion of blood plasma, platelets and red blood cells were carried out. Unfortunately, the patient's family gave up treatment and they left the hospital with the patient because of the low chance of recovery 20 hr after admission. Based on blood toxicology screening, patient history and rapid deterioration of the patient, the cause of fulminant hepatic failure was determined to be acute intoxication of 1,2,3-trichloropropane by unintentional toxicity. 1,2,3-trichloropropane has histopathological toxic effects on many organs and this toxic effect occurs within a short period after ingestion, with liver as the major affected organ.",

Groups of approximately 340 medaka (two replicates of 170) were maintained in aquaria water containing ... 0, 4.5, 9.0, or 18.0 mg/L 1,2,3-trichloropropane. The overall study durations were 16 months for all guppy studies ...  and 13 months for ...  1,2,3-trichloropropane-exposed medaka.  Ten guppies and 10 medaka from each group replicate were sacrificed at 9 months for histopathologic analysis. Approximately one third of the remaining fish from each group were placed in chemical-free water at 9 months and constituted a stop-exposure study component. The remainder of the fish were exposed for the duration of the study and constituted the core study component. A stop-exposure component was added to determine if stopping the exposure at 9 months and transferring to chemical-free aquaria might allow for better survival and tumor development. The sex of guppies and medaka was determined at histopathologic analysis... 16-MONTH STUDY IN GUPPIES The survival of exposed guppies was less than that of the control group at 9 months. Reduced survival was evident at 6 months in the 18.0 mg/L groups and at 7 months in the 4.5 and 9.0 mg/L groups. Survival was significantly reduced in the 18.0 mg/L core study group within 1 month of the 9-month interim evaluation, and mortality in this group was 42.6% between 9 months and study termination. Nominal exposure concentrations of 4.5, 9.0, and 18.0 mg/L resulted in actual exposure concentrations of 4.4, 8.8, and 18.2 mg/L 1,2,3-trichloropropane, respectively. Guppies in the 18.0 mg/L core study group were significantly longer and weighed more than the controls. Fish in the 18.0 mg/L stop-exposure group also weighed more than the controls. Mortality of fish during the study resulted in unequal numbers of individuals distributed to core study and stop-exposure aquaria at 9 months. This appears to have influenced the length and weight of fish measured at study termination (i.e., the smaller tank population allowed the fish to grow more). Observed differences in weight and length between controls and 18.0 mg/L fish was most likely an artifact of the reduced numbers of fish in the 18.0 mg/L aquaria.  At 9 months, multiple hepatocellular adenomas occurred in one 4.5 mg/L male, and one hepatocellular adenoma occurred in a control male. In the core study, increased incidences of cholangiocellular (bile duct) and hepatocellular neoplasms occurred in exposed groups of males and females. Cholangioma and cholangiocarcinoma were seen in several exposed males and females. In the stop-exposure study, increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms occurred in 18.0 mg/L males and increased incidences of cholangiocellular (bile duct) neoplasms occurred in 18.0 mg/L females. 13-MONTH STUDY IN MEDAKA Survival in the 9.0 and 18.0 mg/L groups indicated that 1,2,3-trichloropropane was chronically toxic to the medaka; reduced survival was evident beginning at 9 months of exposure. Mortality in the 18.0 mg/L core study group was 26.3% and mortality in the 9.0 mg/L group was 17.3% between 9 months and study termination at 13 months. Survival was also reduced in stopexposure fish from the 9.0 and 18.0 mg/L groups at the end of the study. Nominal exposure concentrations of 4.5, 9.0, and 18.0 mg/L resulted in actual exposure concentrations of 4.6, 9.2, and 18.0 mg/L 1,2,3-trichloropropane, respectively. At 9 months, the weights of medaka in the 9.0 and 18.0 mg/L groups were significantly increased. Core study medaka in the 18.0 mg/L group were both longer and weighed more than the controls at the end of the study. Observed differences in length and/or weight between controls and 9.0 or 18.0 mg/L fish were most likely an artifact of the reduced numbers of fish in these exposure aquaria.  The incidences of cholangiocarcinomas in the 9.0 and 18.0 mg/L groups of males were significantly increased at 9 months. In the core study, the incidences of cholangiocarcinoma were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and females; the incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms and hepatocholangiocarcinomas were significantly increased in 18.0 mg/L medaka.  In the stop-exposure study, increased incidences of cholangiocarcinoma occurred in all exposed groups of males and females. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly increased in 18.0 mg/L females.  At 9 months, papillary adenomas of the gallbladder occurred in two 18.0 mg/L males. No gallbladder neoplasms were seen in the controls or any of the other exposed groups. In the core study, papillary adenoma of the gallbladder occurred in a number of exposed males and females, and incidences were significantly increased in the 9.0 and 18.0 mg/L groups. In the stop-exposure study, the incidence of papillary adenoma in males exposed to 18.0 mg/L was significantly increased; papillary adenoma and carcinoma were observed in most exposed groups of males and females. Conclusions. Under the conditions of these waterborne studies, 1,2,3-trichloropropane at concentrations of up to 18 mg/L for 16 months was considered carcinogenic for male and female guppies based on increased incidences of a variety of liver neoplasms. Under the conditions of these waterborne studies, 1,2,3-trichloropropane at concentrations of up to 18 mg/L for 13 months was considered carcinogenic for male and female medaka based on increased incidences of a variety of liver neoplasms and papillary adenoma of the gallbladder.",

Based on results of a dose-finding study (Task 1), 30, 60, & 120 mg/kg bw were chosen to investigate effects on fertility & reproduction. Male & female mice were continuously exposed for a 7-day precohabitation & a 98-day cohabitation period (Task 2). Subsequently, the control & 120 mg/kg groups were used in a cross-over mating trial (Task 3) to determine the sex affected by chemical treatment. The F1 generation from control, 30 & 60 as well as 120 mg/kg groups were also evaluated (Task 4). TCP treatment caused a dose-related impairment of fertility. In the high dose group, fewer pairs delivered third, fourth, & fifth litters & the litters had fewer live pups. Parental body weights were not decreased during Task 2 & 3. During Task 3, treated females mated to control males produced fewer live pups. In both male & female F0 mice, liver weights were increased; female kidney & ovary weights were reduced, & epididymal weight was slightly reduced in the high dose group. Sperm parameters were unchanged. The fertility index in the second generation pups fed TCP was also significantly reduced. The number of pups trended lower at the high dose, while other fertility endpoints remained unchanged. Some of the interesting findings of the present study included (1) clear demonstration of a progressive effect on fertility & reproduction by TCP treatment (2) a significant reduction in the proportion of male pups born alive in the 120 mg/kg group in the 5th litter. In summary, there is clear evidence that TCP at 120 mg/kg is a reproductive toxicant in Swiss mice in the presence of mild systemic toxicity.",

Animals were evaluated at 8 or 17 weeks. All rats in the 250 mg/kg groups died by week 5. One male and four female rats in the 125 mg/kg groups died during the study. The mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of males receiving 63 mg/kg and of males and females receiving 125 mg/kg were lower than those of the controls. Hematocrit values, hemoglobin concentrations, and erythrocyte counts decreased with dose in males and females. Serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities were significantly increased in some female rats receiving 125 mg/kg. Serum pseudocholinesterase activity decreased with dose in females. Increases in kidney and liver weights were related to chemical administration. The principal toxic lesions associated with the administration of 1,2,3-trichloropropane to rats were hepatocellular necrosis, karyomegaly, and biliary hyperplasia of the liver; renal tubule necrosis, regeneration, and karyomegaly of the kidney; and necrosis and inflammation of the nasal olfactory and respiratory epithelium.",

Its occurrence as an impurity in nematicides and soil fumigants will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.69 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,2,3-trichloropropane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,2,3-trichloropropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 46 days. 1,2,3-Trichloropropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,2,3-trichloropropane is expected to have high mobility based upon Koc values of 95 and 77. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.43X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. 1,2,3-Trichloropropane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 1,2,3-trichloropropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the theoretical BOD in four weeks was reached, indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. However, aerobic biodegradation may occur in the presence of other halogens and using an adapted culture. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 hours and 6 days, respectively. A BCF range of 5.3-13 suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A hydrolysis half-life of about 44 years in water at pH 7 indicates that hydrolysis is not an important environmental fate process. Occupational exposure to 1,2,3-trichloropropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2,3-trichloropropane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,2,3-trichloropropane via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Muscle, liver, internal organs, fatty tissue, and blood were analyzed after 5, 10, 15, and 19 weeks for PAC, lipid, and moisture content. At all collection times, concentrations expressed on a per gram basis were higher in fatty tissue and internal organs, followed by liver and muscle, and lowest levels were observed in blood. When examining the tissue burden, the highest bioaccumulations of carbazole, dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene, and fluorene were in muscle and internal organs, intermediate in fatty tissue, and lowest in blood and liver. Carbazole with the lowest log K(OW) showed the lowest concentration within any tissue. Levels in tissues were significantly correlated to log K(OW) (> 5% level of significance), especially with longer exposure, and were more highly correlated when examining muscle, fatty tissue, and internal organs (> 0.05%). Different tissues displayed different time trends, and ratios between organs help determine the length of exposure. The most striking change in levels observed with time was in internal organs relative to other tissues, particularly when compared to daily exposure. The elimination of contaminants in feces and gallbladder bile was also compared, because they represent additional tools to assess recent exposure.",

Based on the desulfurization activity, strain G3 was selected as the best strain. From taxonomical studies, the strain was shown to belong to the genus Mycobacterium. Dibenzothiophene was degraded by both growing and resting cells of this strain, and 2-hydroxybiphenyl was detected as a dead-end product. Strain G3 could also desulfurize 4,6-dimethylDBT. Sulfate ion repressed the expression of the DBT desulfurizing enzyme(s). Accumulation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl produced severe inhibitory effects on both cell growth and DBT desulfurization. Resting cells of this strain could desulfurize about 250 ppm of DBT or 4,6-dimethylDBT within 12 hr.",

These heterocycles commonly co-occur in PAH mixtures, which contain agonists for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). /The/ goal for these studies was to explore the effects of two PAH heterocycles, carbazole (CB) and dibenzothiophene (DBT), alone and in combination with a PAH-type agonist for the AHR (beta-naphthoflavone [BNF]) on AHR-mediated cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) activity and on fish embryotoxicity. Embryos of Fundulus heteroclitus were exposed to CB or DBT, with and without coexposure to BNE Carbazole alone slightly induced, whereas DBT alone slightly reduced, in ovo CYP1A-mediated ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity compared to control values. However, exposure to CB or DBT reduced in ovo EROD activity in embryos coexposed to BNE Carbazole and DBT were characterized in vitro as noncompetitive CYP1A inhibitors. Carbazole and DBT enhanced the embryotoxicity of BNF, although neither compound was embryotoxic by itself. The co-occurrence of CB and DBT with PAH-type AHR inducers in contaminated ecosystems may increase the toxicity of PAH-type AHR agonists in these settings and may need to be considered when estimating the embryotoxicity of PAH mixtures.",

Abnormal behavior that ranged from a general sluggishness to full anesthesia developed within 2 hr of treatment and resolved with in 24 hr in mice that survived. Gross lesions in mice that died included pulmonary congestion and edema, mild hydrothorax, intestinal hemorrhage, and mottled livers.

Unsubstituted PAHs showed trends of increased blue sac disease (BSD) relative to dimethylated PAHs, although the severity of BSD induction varied. Results demonstrated that the dibenzothiophene congeners were the strongest inducers of BSD of the commercial PAHs tested. These compounds reduced the hatching success of embryonic medaka, an effect that was enhanced in the mixture. The base neutral extract significantly increased the frequency and severity of BSD abnormalities, while significantly reducing larval hatch length. Based on these results, a sublethal maximum allowable toxicant concentration (MATC) of 13.91 ug PAHs/L was calculated. /Dibenzothiophene congeners/",

The mutagenic activity of some of these compounds, including dibenzothiophene, benzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene, benzo[b]naphtho[2,1-d]thiophene and benzo[b]naphtho[2,3-d]thiophene have been determined using the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. These compounds demonstrated either very weak or no mutagenic activity. The methyl derivatives of each of these four compounds were assayed for mutagenic activity. Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 was used as the tester strain. All assays required a rat-liver homogenate metabolic activator. Five of the methylated derivatives, 1-methylbenzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene, 3-methylbenzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene, 1-methylbenzo[b]-naphtho[2,1-d]thiophene, 6-methylbenzo[b]naphtho[2,1-d]thiophene and 4-methylbenzo[b]naphtho[2,3-d]thiophene demonstrated mutagenic activity. However, activity was observed only at high concentrations of the metabolic activator.",

To elucidate the toxic mechanisms underlying these different defects, ... zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos /were exposed/ to seven non-alkylated PAHs, including five two- to four-ring compounds that are abundant in crude oil and two compounds less abundant in oil but informative for structure-activity relationships. /The authors/ also analyzed two PAH mixtures that approximate the composition of crude oil at different stages of weathering. Exposure to the three-ring PAHs dibenzothiophene and phenanthrene alone was sufficient to induce the characteristic suite of defects, as was genetic ablation of cardiac function using a cardiac troponin T antisense morpholino oligonucleotide. The primary etiology of defects induced by dibenzothiophene or phenanthrene appears to be direct effects on cardiac conduction, which have secondary consequences for late stages of cardiac morphogenesis, kidney development, neural tube structure, and formation of the craniofacial skeleton. The relative toxicity of the different mixtures was directly proportional to the amount of phenanthrene, or the dibenzothiophene-phenanthrene total in the mixture. Pyrene, a four-ring PAH, induced a different syndrome of anemia, peripheral vascular defects, and neuronal cell death, similar to the effects previously described for potent aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands. Therefore, different PAH compounds have distinct and specific effects on fish at early life history stages.",

With the exception of acridine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and neutral N-, S-, and O-monosubstituted analogues showed similar toxicities to soil collembolans when the results were expressed in relation to total soil concentrations (mg/kg). The estimated concentrations resulting in a 10% reduction of reproductive output (EC10 values) were based on measured initial concentrations and were for acridine 290 mg/kg, carbazole 10 mg/kg, dibenzofuran 19 mg/kg, dibenzothiophene 7.8 mg/kg, fluoranthene 37 mg/kg, fluorene 7.7 mg/kg, phenantrene 23 mg/kg, and pyrene 10 mg/kg. When the EC10 values were converted to soil pore-water concentrations, they showed a highly significant correlation (r2 = 0.71, p < 0.01) to no-observed-effect concentrations for the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, as estimated by a quantitative structure activity relation (QSAR) for baseline toxicity (nonpolar narcosis). Only carbazole and acridine were more than two times more toxic (4.9 and 3.1, respectively) than expected from the Daphnia QSAR data. ...",

After three weeks of exposure, seed emergence and seedling weight (fresh weight and dry weight) were determined. Exposure concentrations were verified with chemical analysis. The substances tested were four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (fluoranthene, pyrene, phenanthrene and fluorene), the N-, S-, and O-substituted analogues of fluorene (carbazole, dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran, respectively), and the quinoline representative acridine. Seedling growth was a far more sensitive endpoint than seed emergence for all substances. Concentrations estimated to give a 20% reduction of seedling fresh weight (EC20-values) ranged from 36 to 290 mg/kg for carbazole, 43 to 93 mg/kg for dibenzofuran, 37 to 110 mg/kg for dibenzothiophene, 140 to 650 mg/kg for fluoranthene, 55 to 380 mg/kg for fluorene, 37 to 300 mg/kg for phenanthrene, and 49 to 1300 mg/kg for pyrene. For acridine, no toxicity was observed within the concentration range tested (1-1000 mg/kg). As illustrated by the EC20-values, there was a rather large difference in sensitivity between the species, and T. pratense was the most sensitive of the species tested.",

Dibenzothiophene and phenanthrene exhibited similar uptake curves. No clear trend was observed for elimination differences between PASH and PAH.",

Dibenzothiophene is a component of fossil fuels and is consequently emitted from the exhaust of automobiles and from the combustion of coal. Accidental spills of petroleum products can also release large quantities of dibenzothiophene into the environment. It was estimated that over 77 metric tons of dibenzothiophene and methyl dibenzothiophenes were released to the environment from the accidental spill of the Exxon Valdez on March 24, 1989 in the Prince William Sound, Alaska. If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 2.05X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibenzothiophene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dibenzothiophene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Particulate-phase dibenzothiophene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Dibenzothiophene may also be susceptible to direct photolysis based on photolysis studies in water; however, the rate of this reaction in the atmosphere is not known. If released to soil, dibenzothiophene is expected to have no mobility based upon Koc values of 5,273 to 18,937, which were derived from sediment and soil samples from the Ohio, Missouri, Mississippi, and Illinois Rivers and their watersheds. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole; however, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Dibenzothiophene is relatively persistent in the environment, but may biodegrade after long lag periods, or in soils that are acclimated to petroleum products. The biodegradation half-life of dibenzothiophene in an aerobic groundwater/soil slurry obtained from a creosote contaminated site was approximately 8.2 days. If released into water, dibenzothiophene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the Koc data. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant; however, adsorption to suspended solids and sediment may attenuate this process. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 24 hours and 16 days, respectively if adsorption is neglected. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is approximately 271 days when adsorption is considered. BCF values of 1,220-2,410 measured in fish suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Photolysis in sunlit surface waters may be an important fate process for dibenzothiophene based on estimated photolysis half-lives of 16, 39, and 8 days in a river, eutrophic pond, and oligotrophic pond. Laboratory studies using purified ater, lake water, pond water, and creek water yielded photolysis half-lives of 3.5, 3.1, 3.4, and 2.7 days, respectively, for dibenzothiophene. Occupational exposure to dibenzothiophene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dibenzothiophene is produced or used, or in workplaces where coal and petroleum products are frequently used such as coke plants and creosote manufacturing facilities. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dibenzothiophene via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of food. Dibenzothiophene is also used in cosmetic products to impart a green fluorescent color; therefore the general population may also be exposed to dibenzothiophene through dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure of 2.05X10-4 mm Hg(4) and water solubility of 1.47 mg/L(5). However, adsorption to suspended solids and sediment may attenuate this process(SRC). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 24 hours and 16 days, respectively when adsorption is neglected. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is estimated as 217 days when adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values of 1,220-2,410 measured in fish(8), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Biodegradation is expected to occur in acclimated aqueous environments(SRC). Dibenzothiophene was slowly degraded (lag periods of 19-118 days) in three different microcosms using groundwater from a creosote contaminated site(9) and had a half-life of 10 days following a 7 day acclimation period in groundwater from a gasoline contaminated aquifer(10).

Vapor-phase dibenzothiophene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.1X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Particulate-phase dibenzothiophene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Dibenzothiophene absorbs UV light greater than 290 nm(4) and is susceptible to direct photolysis in the environment(5); however, the rate of this reaction in the atmosphere is not known(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Dibenzothiophene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(2). Dibenzothiophene absorbs UV light greater than 290 nm(3) and is susceptible to direct photolysis in the environment(5). Using a wavelength dependent molar absorptivity and reaction quantum yield calculated from UV absorption spectra, and a simulated midsummer sunlight intensity at latitude 40 N, the near surface aqueous photolysis half-life of dibenzothiophene was estimated as 5.7 days(4). The photolysis half-life for dibenzothiophene in a river, eutrophic pond, and oligotrophic pond were estimated as 16, 39, and 8 days, respectively(5). Photolysis half-lives for dibenzothiophene of 3.5, 3.1, 3.4, and 2.7 days were calculated in laboratory experiments using pure water, lake water, pond water, and creek water, respectively(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that dibenzothiophene is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be severely attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 24 hours when adsorption is neglected(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 16 days when neglecting adsorption(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 217 days when adsorption is considered(4). Dibenzothiophene's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur, but adsorption may attenuate this process(SRC).

Vapor-phase emissions of dibenzothiophene were 16.9 and 17.5 ug/hour without a catalytic converter and 7.4 and 8.2 ug/hour, when a catalytic converter was used(1). Dibenzothiophene was identified as a volatile emission product of hot asphalt roofing tar(2). Dibenzothiophene was emitted from light and heavy duty vehicles at a mean rate of 0.15 ug/km(3). Dibenzothiophene was emitted from vehicles near a tunnel in Los Angeles, CA at rates of 55.3 ug/L (vapor-phase) and 8.8 ug/L (particulate-phase)(4). Dibenzothiophene was identified, not quantified, as a combustion product of pulverized coal and tires(5). Dibenzothiophene was detected in storm water runoff from Philadelphia, PA at 44-62 ng/L(6).

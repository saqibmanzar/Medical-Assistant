Drug uptake into hepatocytes from carcinogen-fed animals was consistently lower than that into hepatocytes from normal animals. Isolated nuclei, prepared from the livers of normal and AAF-fed rats showed similar proflavine uptake. Drug uptake into hepatocytes from AAF-fed animals, however, was increased by prior exposure to a metabolic inhibitor. Thus, differences in drug uptake may reflect changes in the cell membrane, together with an alteration in the metabolic integrity of the cells. The uptake of drug in hepatocytes from AAF-fed rats was uniformly low within each cell preparation. However, drug uptake varied not only between tumours arising in the livers of these animals but also within each tumour cell preparation. This study indicates that flow cytometry can provide an effective means for analysing drug uptake into cell populations arising during hepatocarcinogenesis.",

After i.v. dosing, plasma concentration-time profiles of parent PRO and ACR were best described by two- and three-compartment pharmacokinetic models respectively. Terminal elimination half-lives of PRO and ACR in plasma were 8.7 and 11.4 h respectively. 3. In animals dosed with 14C-PRO or 14C-ACR, total drug equivalent concentrations were highest in the excretory organs and lowest in muscle, fat and plasma. In PRO-dosed animals, residues in the liver and trunk kidney were composed primarily of glucuronosyl and acetyl conjugates of PRO; residues in muscle were composed mostly (> 95%) of the parent drug. In ACR-dosed animals, the parent compound comprised > 90% of the total residues in all tissues examined. 4. PRO and ACR were poorly absorbed in catfish during waterborne exposure. At the end of a 4-h exposure, parent PRO and ACR concentrations in muscle were 0.064 and 0.020 microgram/g respectively. Levels in muscle declined below the limit of determination (0.005 microgram/g) within 1-2 weeks.",

Fourteen hours after intraarterial bolus administration of 10 mg/kg of proflavine, three metabolites were found in liver and bile, and one metabolite was found in plasma using reversed-phase HPLC with UV detection at 262 nm. Treatment with hydrochloric acid converted the three metabolites to proflavine, which suggested that the metabolites were proflavine conjugates. Treatment with beta-glucuronidase and saccharic acid 1,4-lactone, a specific beta-glucuronidase inhibitor, revealed that two metabolites were proflavine glucuronides. For determination of UV-VIS absorption and mass spectra, HPLC-purified metabolites were isolated from liver. Data from these experiments suggested that the proflavine metabolites were 3-N-glucuronosyl proflavine (PG), 3-N-glucuronosyl,6-N-acetyl proflavine (APG), and 3-N-acetylproflavine (AP). The identities of the metabolites were verified by chemical synthesis. When synthetic PG and AP were compared with the two metabolites isolated from trout, they had the same molecular weight as determined by matrix-assisted, laser desorption ionization, time-of-flight MS. In addition, they coeluted on HPLC under different mobile phase conditions. Finally, the in vitro incubation with liver subcellular preparations confirmed this characterization and provided the evidence that APG can be formed by glucuronidation of AP or acetylation of PG.",

Catfish muscle was individually fortified with ACR (purified from commercial product) and PRO at concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 ppb (5 replicates per level). Mean recoveries from fortified muscle at each level ranged from 86 to 95%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2.5 to 5.7%. The method was applied to incurred residues of ACR and PRO in muscle after waterborne exposure of channel catfish to commercial acriflavine (10 ppm total dye for 4 h). RSDs for incurred residues of ACR and PRO were in the same range as those for fortified muscle. Low residue concentrations (< 1% of exposure water concentration) suggested poor absorption of ACR and PRO in catfish.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The nature of the binding has been investigated by nuclear  magnetic resonance techniques, and the results support and clarify earlier suggestions that  the first 3 members of the series intercalate into DNA while the diisopropyl and  di-tert.-butyl compounds do not. Toxicity of the drugs was primarily associated with their  mode of DNA binding, but lipophilicity had an important secondary effect. It seems likely that  the toxic properties of the more lipophilic DNA-intercalating members of the series mask their  potential for 'petite' mutagenesis.",

Enumeration of S. dublin and the heterotrophic  bacteria showed that in both illuminated and nonilluminated systems (without proflavine) the  bacteria remained viable and culturable for at least 6 days. The optimal proflavine  concentration (no effect in the dark and a maximal photoinactivation of salmonellae after  irradiation) was 2 mg l(-1). In contrast to S. dublin, the heterotrophic bacteria overcame the  initial inhibitory effect of proflavine. The possible use of photosterilization against  contamination with pathogenic bacteria in water model ecosystems, is discussed.",

The results (1) confirmed MOP photocarcinogenicity, (2) demonstrated that both NR and PF are photocarcinogens, and, further, (3) showed that the above UV light with 2.6% of fluence at 313 nm is a long-term carcinogenic agent even though the total dose of 313 nm was 100 times less than the minimal UV tumorigenic dose in mice. The tumors were mammary adenocarcinomas, carcinomas of skin appendages, carcino-mixo-sarcomas, lymphomas, and one case of thyroid adenocarcinoma. The implications of the above data regarding the controversy about oncogenic risks in photochemotherapy are discussed.",

The overall incidence of malignant lymphomas was  high: 16/50 females and 11/50 males in the low-dose group, and 20/50 and 11/50, respectively,  in the controls. Because a positive control carcinogen, N-2-fluorenylacetamide, was tested in  the same room with these animals, the authors questioned the validity of these bioassay  results; the statistical inference was made, however, that in female mice there was a strong  association of development of hepatocellular carcinomas with the dose of proflavine  monohydrochloride hemihydrate administered. /Proflavine monohydrochloride hemihydrate/",

The compound was administered in the diet at concentrations of 300 and 600 ppm to groups of 50 rats for 109 weeks and at concentrations of 200 and 400 ppm to groups of 50 mice for 104 weeks. The animals were subjected to necropsy and histopathologic evaluation as they died or at the end of their periods of treatment. Average weights attained by high-dose groups were consistently lower than those of control groups; weights of low-dose groups showed essentially no differences from those of the controls. Survival rates of the treated rats and mice did not differ from those of the controls except for a lower rate among the female mice. Five malignant neoplasms of the intestinal tract consisting of three leiomyosarcomas of the small intestine, a sarcoma near the colon area, and an adenocarcinoma of the small intestine were observed in five of the high-dose male rats. None were observed in other treatment or control groups. If these five intestinal neoplasms are considered together, they aresignificant at the P=0.026 level using the Fisher exact test. A positive dose-related trend (P=0.034) was also present for the three leiomyosarcomas. The observed incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in female mice was 4/50 (8%) in the control group, 20/49 (41%) in the low-dose group, and 22/50 (44%) in the high-dose group. The test for dose-related trend showed a level of significance of P<0.001. In male mice, the observed incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was 20/49 (41%) in the control group 28/49 (57%) in the low-dose group, and 30/50 (60%) in the high-dose group. The dose-related trend was significant at P=0.057, and the high dose was significant at P=0.044. The unusually high incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and hemangiosarcomas in control male mice and the unusually high incidence of malignant lymphomas in all groups of female mice in conjunction with the fact that a positive-control carcinogen was tested in the same room with these animals, raises a question of the validity of these bioassay results. /Proflavine monohydrochloride hemihydrate (CAS No. 952-23-8)/",

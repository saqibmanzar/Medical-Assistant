Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Female Wistar rats were administered aniline, N-methylaniline, N,N-dimethylaniline, o-toluidine, m-toluidine, p-toluidine, 2,4-dimethylaniline, 2,4,5-trimethylaniline, p-chloroaniline 3,4-dichloroaniline, 4-chloro-o-toluidine, 5-chloro-o-toluidine, or 6-chloro-o-toluidine by gavage. Blood samples were collected 24 hr later and the hemoglobin was isolated. The hemoglobin samples were extracted with hexane, hydrolyzed with sodium hydroxide, and the amount of each amine recovered was determined by gas chromatography. The extent of amine/hemoglobin binding was determined by computing hemoglobin binding indices (HBIs) from the administered doses and the amount of amine recovered. Female B6C3F1 mice were administered aniline, o-toluidine, p-chloroaniline, 4-chloro-o-toluidine, or 5-chloro-o-toluidine. The extent of amine/hemoglobin binding was determined as before. Rats were given 2,4-dimethylaniline, aniline, 5-chloro-o-toluidine, 4-aminobiphenyl, or p-chloroaniline, and the extent of methemoglobin formation was determined. In rats hydrolysis of the hemoglobin yielded only one cleavage product, the parent amine, in each case. An additional signal was seen in the chromatogram in the case of 6-chloro-o-toluidine. The hemoglobin binding indices ranged from 0.7 for 2,4,5-trimethylaniline to 569 for p-chloroaniline. The binding of aniline, o-toluidine, p-chloroaniline, 4-chloro-o-toluidine, and 5-chloro-o-toluidine in mice was significantly lower than in rats. The extent of amine/hemoglobin binding in rats correlated well with the maximum concentrations of methemoglobin. /Results indicate/ that determining hemoglobin adducts may be useful for monitoring occupational exposure to amines.",

High-volume manufacture of toluidines utilizes the same type of continuous vapor-phase hydrogenation process used for aniline manufacture. The catalyst include various supported metals, Raney nickel, copper, molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, and noble metals. The catalyst is suspended in a column or bed, and a gaseous mixture of the nitrotoluene and excess hydrogen is passed over it at about 250 \u00b0C. The gaseous products are condensed, the aqueous and organic layers are separated, excess hydrogen is recycled, and the final crude product is dried and distilled.",

The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

Although the metabolites, 2-amino-4-methylphenol and 4-amino-2-methylphenol were identified in the rat urine with a small amount of the parent compound, there is not sufficient information on metabolism and toxicokinetics. Acute toxicity of m-toluidine is low because the oral LD50 values in rat, mouse and rabbit are from 450 to 1,430 mg/kg. This chemical is slightly irritating to skin and moderately irritating to eyes. There is no information available on skin sensitization. In accordance with an OECD combined repeat dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity screening test [TG 422], m-toluidine was given to Crj: CD (SD) male and female rats by gavage at doses of 0, 30, 100, 300 mg/kg/day for at least 41 days. The critical effect at 100 and 300 mg/kg is a hemolytic anemia, revealed by reduction of erythrocyte counts and hemoglobin concentration, and histological changes such as pigment deposit and extramedullary hematopoiesis in liver and spleen. Other toxicity is renal tubular epithelium lesions accompanied with pigment deposit in kidney. As there is suggestive evidence of hemolytic anemia such as marginal pigment deposit and extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen at the lowest dose of 30 mg/kg, probably caused by methemoglobin formation, LOAEL for repeat dose toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day. In the above screening test [OECD TG 422], m-toluidine was given from 14 days before mating to 14 days after mating in males and from 14 days before mating to day 3 of lactation in females. As implantation losses were found in all animals at 300 mg/kg and two of ten at 100 mg/kg but not at 30 mg/kg, NOAEL for reproductive toxicity is 30 mg/kg/day. The death of all pups or more than half the number of pups observed at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day is considered as the result of maternal toxicity because there is clear evidence of the lack of the nursing activity, probably due to anemia, and all live offsprings of 30 and 100 mg/kg had normally developed up to 4 days. Therefore the NOAEL for developmental toxicity is considered to be 100 mg/kg/day. Bacterial genotoxicity studies show negative results in S. typhimurium and E. coli with and without metabolic activation. In chromosomal aberration test conducted in cultured Chinese hamster lung (CHL/IU) cells by OECD TG 473, clastogenicity was not observed but significant increase of polyploidy (0.9 to 1.25 %) was found at the highest concentration. However, this result was considered not to be positive because it was within historical control and generally accepted criteria of significance (5 %). Two kinds of in vivo studies, sister chromatid exchange and inhibition of DNA-synthesis, also show negative results. Therefore m-toluidine is considered not to be genotoxic. Tumors were not observed in dietary study of male rats at 9,400 ppm and male and female mice at 14,700 and 20,400 ppm, respectively. However, the carcinogenicity in rodents is inconclusive because the experimental conditions were insufficient compared to a current carcinogenicity testing protocol. Environment. This chemical is mainly persistent in water and it will be transported to water compartment when released to other environmental compartments. The chemical is not readily biodegradable, and its bioaccumulation potential is low. This chemical has been tested in a limited number of aquatic species. For algae, 72 hr EC50 (biomass change in Selenastrum capricornutum) is 17.7 mg/L. For Daphnia, the lowest acute toxicity value is 0.73 mg/L (48 hr EC50 for immobilization), and the lowest chronic value is 0.01 mg/L (21d NOEC for reproduction). For fish, only acute data were available, the lowest of which is 34 mg/L (96 hr LC50, Oryzias latipes). PNEC of 0.0001 mg/L for the aquatic organisms was calculated from the lowest chronic value (NOEC for Daphnia; 0.01 mg/L) using an assessment factor of 100. Toxicity of this chemical to aquatic organisms, specially against Daphnia, is high. Exposure. The production volume of m-toluidine in Japan was less than 100 tonnes in 1990 - 1992, and imported volume was 97-285 tonnes/year in 1988-1992, however both the production volume and imported volume in Japan in 1998 was 0 ton. This chemical is used as intermediates for pigments, photography agents and others. This chemical is stable in neutral or alkaline solutions, and is classified as \"not readily biodegradable\". Direct photodegradation is expected. The half-life is estimated to be about 4 months. A generic fugacity model (Mackey level III) shows this chemical would be distributed mainly to water. In the monitoring study of the general environment in Japan in 1977, m-toluidine was detected from surface water and sediment, but in the monitoring study in 1999, it was not detected in water, sediment or air. According to a Japanese manufacturer, 400 kg/year (estimated) of m-toluidine are released with 1 x 10+7 tonnes/year of effluent into bay. Local predicted environmental concentration (PEClocal) is 4.0 x 10-5 mg/L, employing the calculation model. The highest exposure to the general population via the environment would be expected through drinking water processed from surface water. The concentration in drinking water is assumed to be less than 4.0 x 10-5 mg/L. Consumer exposure is negligible because m-toluidine is not contained in consumer products. As m-toluidine is mainly produced in a closed system, occupational exposures at production sites may occur by the inhalation and dermal route. Estimated human exposure for a worker who operates sampling (0.1 hr/day), drum filling (1.5 hr/day), and reaction vessel cleaning (2 day/year) without protective equipment is less than 0.21 mg/kg/day. By wearing chemical cartridge respirator during these operations, and ventilation systems during the filling process, exposure level is lower than the estimation.",

Severe headache, nausea, sometimes vomiting, dryness of throat. Central nervous symptoms: confusion, ataxia, vertigo, tinnitus, weakness, disorientation, lethargy, drowsiness, and finally coma. Convulsions may occur but appear to be uncommon. Cardiac effects: heart blocks, arrhythmias, and shock. Death, although uncommon, is usually due to cardiovascular collapse and not resp paralysis. Urinary signs and symptoms may incl painful micturition, hematuria, hemoglobinuria, and renal insufficiency (usually mild). A late acute hemolytic episode should be anticipated at 6 to 8 days after ingestion. /Aniline/",

Industrial exposure to aromatic amines has been linked with occupational bladder cancer since the end of the last century. Aromatic amines of industrial importance such as 1-naphthylamine, 1-naphthylthiourea, benzidine, 4-biphenylamine, 4,4'-methylenedianiline, 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, diphenylamine, toluidine, o-toluidine, and p-toluidine are discussed. The epidemiology of bladder cancer is reviewed. Data for the United States in 1981 showes age adjusted incidence rates of bladder cancer per 100,000 of the male population ranging from 7.5 in Puerto Rico to 17.1 in Connecticut. It is noted that the incidence of bladder cancer has been increasing. The epidemiology of industrial bladder cancer is discussed. The historical development of bladder cancer epidemiology is summarized. Studies in the United Kingdom have indicated that 2-naphthylamine is the major carcinogenic amine in the British dyestuffs industry. ... Screening as a means of protecting workers at risk is discussed.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.303 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-aminotoluene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-aminotoluene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.9 hours. 3-Aminotoluene has a UV absorption band at 286 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3-aminotoluene is expected to have very high mobility based upon a Koc of 44. The pKa of 3-aminotoluene is 4.69, indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process for the neutral species based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.66X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 3-Aminotoluene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Complete degradation of 3-aminotoluene was obtained within 8 days with a soil inoculum, indicating that biodegradation in soil is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 3-aminotoluene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. 3-Aminotoluene reached 50% and 97.7% of its theoretical BOD in 5 days using water and activated sludge inoculum, respectively, indicating that biodegradation in water is an important environmental fate process. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process for the neutral species based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 23 and 170 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3.9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 3-aminotoluene may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-aminotoluene is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 3-aminotoluene via dermal contact with this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization of 3-aminotoluene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process for the neutral species(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.66X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(5). 3-Aminotoluene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.303 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(6). Complete degradation of 3-aminotoluene was obtained within 8 days with a soil inoculum(7), suggesting that 3-aminotoluene will be readily biodegradable in the terrestrial environment.

Vapor-phase 3-aminotoluene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.9 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.0X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 3-Aminotoluene has a UV absorption band at 286 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.9 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 3-Aminotoluene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). 3-Aminotoluene has a UV absorption band at 286 nm(3) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Colored degradation products are formed in the presence of light and oxygen with the reaction rate being first order with respect to oxygen and proportional to the intensity of irradiation(3). Photochemical half-lives of approximately 5.1 and 68 hours were measured for irradiation with a germicidal UV lamp and a fluorochemical lamp operating at 300-400 nm, respectively(4). Aromatic amines are sensitive to oxidation by air and undergo soil- and clay-catalyzed free radical oxidation(5,6). They are also readily oxidized by metal ions that may occur in soil or natural waters(5). In four hours, 13-27% of aminotoluene (isomer unspecified) was oxidized after being mixed with 20 ppm of ferric ion(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.0X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphite will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphite will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours. Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphite does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 100% hydrolysis in 20 minutes indicates that adsorption to soil and volatilization from moist soil are not expected to be an important environmental fate processes. Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphite is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon the estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not avialable. If released to water, adsorption to suspended solids and sediment, volatilization, and bioconcentration of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphite are not expected to be important environment fate processes due to 100% hydrolysis in 20 minutes at pH 7 and 23 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphite may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphite is produced or used.

Vapor-phase tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphite is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.2X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphite does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

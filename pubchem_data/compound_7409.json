When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The reaction with the wild type enzyme produces one regioisomer 1-phenylethanol with 5% reduced nicotinamide adenine deoxyribonucleic acid product conversion of and a ration of 73:27 for the R and S enantiomers respectively. Ethylbenzene was modeled into the active site of wild type p450cam in a rigid mode and oriented to optimize either pro-R or pro-S hydrogen abstraction. Residues T101, T185 and V247 make extensive contacts with the substrate in the static complexes and were therefore chosen for site directed mutagenesis. Single mutants T101M, V247A and V247M are more stereospecific producing 89, 87 and 82% (R)-1-phenylethanol respectively. The coupling of the reaction is doubled for the single mutants T185L, T185F and V247M. In an effort to engineer incr stereospecificity and coupling into a single catalyst the T101M, T185F and V247M mutants were combined in a multiple mutant of p450cam. This protein hydroxylates ethylbenzene resulting in an R:S ratio of 87:13 for the 1-phenylethanols and 13% coupling of reducing equivalents to product. The catalytic stereospecificity and stoichiometry with T101-T185F-V247M does not represent a summation of changes observed for the single mutants. A portion of the individual effects on substrate recognition produced by the single substitutions is either eliminated or degenerate within the triple mutant.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Acetyl bromide reacts violently with alcohols or water [Merck 11th ed. 1989]. Mixtures of alcohols with concentrated sulfuric acid and strong hydrogen peroxide can cause explosions. Example: An explosion will occur if dimethylbenzylcarbinol is added to 90% hydrogen peroxide then acidified with concentrated sulfuric acid. Mixtures of ethyl alcohol with concentrated hydrogen peroxide form powerful explosives. Mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and 1-phenyl-2-methyl propyl alcohol tend to explode if acidified with 70% sulfuric acid [Chem. Eng. News 45(43):73. 1967; J, Org. Chem. 28:1893. 1963]. Alkyl hypochlorites are violently explosive. They are readily obtained by reacting hypochlorous acid and alcohols either in aqueous solution or mixed aqueous-carbon tetrachloride solutions. Chlorine plus alcohols would similarly yield alkyl hypochlorites. They decompose in the cold and explode on exposure to sunlight or heat. Tertiary hypochlorites are less unstable than secondary or primary hypochlorites [NFPA 491 M. 1991]. Base-catalysed reactions of isocyanates with alcohols should be carried out in inert solvents. Such reactions in the absence of solvents often occur with explosive violence [Wischmeyer 1969].",

Once formed, organic peroxides are sensitive to thermal or mechanical shock and can be violently explosive in concentrated solutions or as solids.",

Renal toxicity characterized by severe nephropathy and related secondary lesions was observed in the dosed rats, and excessive mortality occurred during the last quarter of the studies. Poor survival reduced the sensitivity of the studies for detecting the presence of a carcinogenic response both in chemically exposed groups of male rats and in the high dose group of female rats.

If released to the atmosphere, alpha-methylbenzyl alcohol will mainly exist in the vapor phase based on an estimated vapor pressure of 0.058 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase alpha-methylbenzyl alcohol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 8 hours. Measured Koc values from <5-52, with the higher values corresponding to greater organic content in soil, suggest that alpha-methylbenzyl alcohol will have very high mobility in soil. Biodegradation is expected to be a major fate process for this compound in both soil and water. In screening tests, alpha-methylbenzyl alcohol was completely biodegraded under aerobic conditions within 2-3 weeks; a half life of 7 days was measured under anaerobic conditions. Acetophenone was produced as a metabolite under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In water, alpha-methylbenzyl alcohol is not expected to adsorb to sediment or suspended matter in the water column. An estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.9X10-7 atm-cu m/mole suggests that this compound will not volatilize from water surfaces. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms should not occur based on an estimated BCF value of 9. Exposure to alpha-methylbenzyl alcohol may occur occupationally during its production or use in the manufacture of other products. The general population may be exposed to alpha-methylbenzyl alcohol through the ingestion of contaminated drinking water and food or the inhalation of air from new buildings. (SRC)",

A Nocardia strain first oxygenates the benzene nucleus to give 3-(1'-hydroxyethyl)-3,5-cyclo-hexadiene-1,2-diol which is then reduced and subjected to extra-diol cleavage(3). This same strain is also able to degrade alpha-methylbenzyl alcohol using the same pathway as described above for Arthrobacter(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

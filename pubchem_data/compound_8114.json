When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Two VOA vials are filled per sample location, then placed in separate plastic bags for shipment and storage. Samples can be analyzed by direct injection or purge-and trap gas chromatography. A temperature program is used in the gas chromatograph to separate the organic compounds. Column 1 is an 8-ft by 0.1-in I.D. stainless steel or glass column packed with 1% SP-1000 on Carbopack-B 60/80 mesh or equivalent. Column 2 is a 6-ft by 0.1-in I.D. stainless steel or glass column packed with n-octane on Porasil-C 100/120 mesh (Durapak) or equivalent. Detection is achieved by a flame ionization detector (FID). Under the prescribed conditions, diethyl ether can be detected using this method. No statistical analysis was determined; specific method performance information will be provided as it becomes available. /Diethyl ether/",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Male CF-1-mice were anesthetized and allowed to recover before exposure. In the first experiment, the irritating effect of airborn chemicals on the trigeminal nerve ends was investigated by observing for reflex induced decrease in the respiratory rate and for the characteristic respiratory patterns. In the second study, the effect on the vagus nerve was investigated by observing for reflex induced decrease in the respiratory rate and for the respiratory patterns. PE was delivered at a rate from 2,400 to 60,000 ppm in an exposure chamber. Each animal was placed in a body plethysmograph attached to the exposure chamber whereby the head protruded from the chamber. The respiratory pattern of each animal was displayed on an oscillograph. Concentration response relationships were obtained by plotting the percentage decrease in the average respiratory rate of each group; from these relationships the concentration expected to cause a 50% decrease in respiratory rate (RD50) due to sensory irritation was estimated. At a concentration of 15,000 ppm or less, the sensory irritation response disappeared after approximately 1 min. The average respiratory rate also decreased within the first minute. For the sensory irritation response the threshold and the RD50 were about 620 and 89,000 ppm, respectively; the sensory irritating concentration needed to depress the respiratory rate to 50% could not be reached with saturated vapor at 20 \u00b0C. At concentrations >15,000 ppm, the sensory irritation response disappeared within 30 sec and was replaced with patterns characteristic for pulmonary irritation or anesthesia. ...",

Each animal was placed in a body plethysmograph attached to the exposure chamber so that the head of the animal protruded into the chamber. The change in tidal volume was obtained from a 10 sec sample once every 1, 2, 5, or 10 min. The respiratory pattern of each animal was displayed on an oscillograph, and the average respiratory rate of each group of four mice was continuously displayed. Exposure to PE was for 30 or 240 min followed by 20 min of recovery. Changes in tidal volume were calculated from the first 10 sec in every experiment. Four mice were given pentobarbitol anesthesia ip and observed on the plethysmograph for the next 240 min; changes in tidal volume were obtained from a 10 sec sample every 10 min. The anesthetic effect of PE was revealed by observing escape activity (body movement) of the mice in the plethysmograph and observing absence of righting reflex at the end of the recovery period. Distinction between changes in respiratory rate and tidal volume due to anesthesia or pulmonary irritation was obtained by comparison of the responses at equal anesthesia concentrations caused by propyl-ether and pentobarbital. After cessation of the sensory irritation response, a mixed response due to pulmonary irritation and anesthesia appeared, resulting in a decrease in respiratory rate and tidal volume. In cannulated mice the decrease in respiratory rate was introduced more slowly. Shortly after injection of pentobarbitol, the respiratory rate decreased in a dose dependent manner; the maximum decrease was found within 10 to 60 minutes. All mice given pentobarbital lost righting reflex at 35 and 50 mg/kg. ...",

                                                    "String": "Dipropyl ether's use as a solvent may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 62.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dipropyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dipropyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and nitrate radicals; half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 21 hours and 4.9 days, respectively. Direct photolysis is not expected to be an important removal process since aliphatic ethers do not absorb light in the environmental UV spectrum. If released to soil, dipropyl ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 15. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Dipropyl ether is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Aqueous screening studies indicate dipropyl ether may be biodegraded under aerobic conditions if acclimated microbial populations are present; following a lag period of 13 days, dipropyl ether reached 63% of its theoretical BOD after 25 days incubation in an activated sludge aqueous screening study. It was not degraded in aquifer materials maintained under anaerobic conditions If released into water, dipropyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives from a model river and a model lake are 3.6 hours and 4.1 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to propyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dipropyl ether is used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase dipropyl ether is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and nitrate radicals(SRC); half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 21 hours and 4.9 days, respectively(3,4). Direct photolysis is not expected to be an important removal process since aliphatic ethers do not absorb light in the environmental UV spectrum(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

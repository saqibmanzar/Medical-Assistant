ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Methemoglobin was calculated from absorbance at 630 nm before and after adding potassium cyanide to lysed blood. Urinary metabolites were isolated as cetylpyridinium salts from rats similarily dosed with 4-fluoroaniline and 2,4,-difluoroaniline. Analysis of urinary metabolites confirmed that these were the o-sulfates of 2-amino-5-aminophenol and 2-amino-3,5-difluorophenol. The excretion of the urinary conjugated aminophenols after oral dosing with these cmpd was rapid and only low concentrations were detected the second day after dosing. About 39% of 4-fluoroanilne and 13% of 2,4-difluoroaniline were accounted by these metabolites.",

Male Wistar-rats were administered 0 or 50 mg/kg 2-fluoroaniline, 3-fluoroaniline, or 4-fluoroaniline orally. Urine samples were collected 24 hours later and analyzed for metabolites by fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Liver microsomes prepared from male Wistar-rats that had been pretreated with the cytochrome-P-450 (P450) inducers were fortified with P450 and incubated with 0 or 10 millimolar 2-fluoroaniline, 3-fluoroaniline, or 4-fluoroaniline for 10 minutes. The incubates were analyzed for metabolites. Frontier electron densities of occupied and unoccupied orbitals of 2-fluoroaniline, 3-fluoroaniline, and 4-fluoroaniline were calculated by a computerized semiempirical molecular orbital technique. 3-Fluoro-4-acetamidophenylsulfate, 3-fluoro-4-aminophenylsulfate, and 3-fluoro-4-acetamidophenylglucuronide were the major 2-fluoroaniline urinary metabolites. 2-Fluoro-4-acetamidophenylsulfate, 4-fluoro-2-aminophenylsulfate, 2-fluoro-4-aminophenylsulfate, and the fluoride-ion (F-) were the major metabolites of 3-fluoroaniline. 5-Fluoro-2-aminophenylsulfate and fluoride-ion were the major metabolites of 4-fluoroaniline. In-vitro, 3-fluoro-4-aminophenol was the major 2-fluoroaniline metabolite. 3-Fluoroaniline was converted primarily to 4-aminophenol and 4-fluoro-2-aminophenol. 4-Fluoroaniline was converted primarily to 5-fluoro-2-aminophenol and F-. In microsomes from rats pretreated with the P450 inducers, 3-fluoroaniline underwent hydroxylation primarily in the para position, the extent of hydroxylation being similar for all pretreatment conditions. Ortho hydroxylation at the C6 position occurred under all pretreatment conditions but to a much smaller extent. Ortho hydroxylation at the C2 position occurred only in microsomes from rats pretreated with 3MC and isosafrole. Frontier electron densities in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the orbital just below it (HOMO-1) were highest in the C4 position followed by the C6 and C2 positions. /The investigators/ conclude that the regioselectivity in the hydroxylation of 3-fluoroaniline can be explained by higher electron densities in the HOMO and HOMO-1 orbitals of the C4 and C6 carbons and the low density at the C2 position. P450 catalyzed hydroxylation of monofluoroanilines apparently involves electrophilic attack of a charged iron/oxygen species derived from P450 on a specific carbon atom of the aromatic ring.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Hindlimb paralysis was found in the 4-bromoaniline, 4-chloroaniline and 4-fluoroaniline groups on clinical observation, with the maximum incidence of 100% in the 4-bromoaniline and 4-fluoroaniline groups and 66.7% in the 4-chloroaniline group. Detailed clinical observations with functional tests identified the following effects: reduced response of hindlimb extensor thrust, gait abnormality in the open field and decreased grip strength in the fore- or hindlimbs in the 4-bromoaniline, 4-chloroaniline and 4-fluoroaniline groups; decreased number of supported rearing episodes in the open field in the 4-bromoaniline and 4-chloroaniline groups; abnormal landing in the aerial righting reflex in the 4-bromoaniline and 4-fluoroaniline groups; and prolonged surface righting reflex in the 4-bromoaniline group. Spongy change in the white matter of the spinal cord and brainstem and nerve fibre degeneration in the peripheral nerves were found in all haloaniline-treated groups. The central and peripheral nervous systems were most severely affected in the 4-bromoaniline group and the lesions in the 4-iodoaniline group were limited in grade. This study demonstrates that a bolus dose of 4-haloanilines to rats induces a neurotoxicity similar in character to that evoked by the parent aniline. The decreasing order of neurotoxic potential appears to be 4-bromoaniline >> 4-fluoroaniline > or = 4-chloroaniline >> 4-iodoaniline when comparing at or near the lethal dosage level.",

Wistar-rats were given 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.13 millimoles per 0.1 kilogram 2,4-difluoroaniline or 4-fluoroaniline or 1.0 millimole per kilogram 4-chloroaniline as a positive control. Blood samples were taken at 1 hour before and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after dosing. Methemoglobin was calculated from absorbance at 630 nanometers before and after adding potassium-cyanide to lysed blood. Urinary metabolites were isolated as cetylpyridinium salts from rats similarly dosed with 4-fluoroaniline and 2,4-difluoroaniline. Metabolites were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and elemental analysis. Neither test compound was as potent an inducer of methemoglobin as the positive control. At all doses of either compound methemoglobin increased rapidly and dropped quickly, returning to background values by 24 hours except at the highest doses. The dose response for each compound was approximately linear. The limit of detection was about 5 milligrams per 0.1 kilogram. Analysis of urinary metabolites confirmed that these were the O-sulfates of 2-amino-5-aminophenol and 2-amino-3,5-difluorophenol. The excretion of the urinary conjugated aminophenols after oral dosing with these compounds was rapid and only low concentrations were detected the second day after dosing. About 39 percent of 4-fluoroaniline and 13 percent of 2,4-difluoroaniline were accounted for by these metabolites. The authors conclude that either method could be used for human exposure monitoring. Methemoglobin determination is rapid and simple but not a very sensitive indicator. Urinary metabolite measurement is more sensitive but more complicated to perform.",

The para position to the amine group in aniline seems to play an important part in the mechansim of action of this compound. Derivatives, p-fluoroaniline (PFA), in which the para site is occupied and o-fluoroaniline (OFA), in which it is free, were studied comparatively. During short-term poisoning via the cutaneous route in rats, PFA causes a significant increase in methemoglobin level; OFA is clearly less active. In the case of PFA, blocking of the para site by fluorine may result in a longer lifetime of the corresponding hydroxylamine that would be responsible for the conversion of the ferrous iron in Hb to ferric iron. In contrast to OFA, PFA is defluorinated notably in vivo, clearly evidenced by the increase in urinary fluoride. Determinations of methemoglobin blood level and urinary fluoridee level are good evidence of impregnation with this substance. Besides the original compounds, it is possible to recover in the urine of poisoned animals a compound that may be o-fluoro-aminophenol in the case of OFA and a compound that appears to be the corresponding hydroxylamine derivative in the case of PFA.",

In the present study, earthworms (Eisenia veneta) were exposed to three different model xenobiotics by a standard filter paper contact test, and toxicant-induced biochemical changes were then investigated by characterizing the changes in endogenous metabolites visible in 600-MHz 1H NMR spectra of tissue extracts. The NMR spectral intensities were converted to discrete numerical values and tabulated in order to provide data matrices suitable for multivariate analysis. Principal component analysis showed that changes had occurred in the biochemical profiles relative to the undosed controls. ... The 4-fluoroaniline-treated worms showed a decrease in maltose concentrations, and 3,5-difluoroaniline exerted the same effect as 2-fluoro-4-methylaniline but to a lesser extent. These changes could potentially be used as novel biomarkers of xenobiotic toxicity and could be used to determine the mechanism of action of other toxic chemicals.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.75 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates 4-fluoroaniline will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-fluoroaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hours. 4-Fluoroaniline absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 4-fluoroaniline is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc value of 113. However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. 4-Fluoroaniline has been observed to bind rapidly to soil in herbicide degradation studies. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 4-Fluoroaniline is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Limited biodegradation data indicate that 4-fluoroaniline is biodegradable, but its rate and relative environmental importance is not certain. If released into water, 4-fluoroaniline is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. However, some binding to suspended organic matter and sediment may occur due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6.4 and 50 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Both direct and indirect photolysis may have some importance in natural waters exposed to sunlight. Occupational exposure to 4-fluoroaniline may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-fluoroaniline is produced or used. (SRC)",

The pKa of 4-fluoroaniline is 4.65(3), indicating that this compound is a weak base and will exist predominantly in the non-ionized form in the environment. However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). 4-Fluoroaniline has been observed to bind rapidly with soil in herbicide degradation studies(6). Volatilization of 4-fluoroaniline from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(2). 4-Fluoroaniline is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.75 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C(7). Limited biodegradation data indicate that 4-fluoroaniline is biodegradable(8,9), but its rate and relative environmental importance is not certain(SRC).",

The pKa of 4-fluoroaniline is 4.65(3), indicating that this compound is a weak base and will exist predominantly in the non-ionized form in the environment. Anilines may bind strongly to humus or organic matter due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5), suggesting some adsorption to suspended solids and sediment may occur(SRC). Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(6) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(6), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6.4 and 50 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.15(7) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 4-Fluoroaniline absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(8) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis(SRC). Aromatic amines are susceptible to photosensitized degradation in natural waters exposed to sunlight due to reaction with OH and RO2 radicals(9); therefore, indirect photolysis may have some environmental importance in natural water(SRC). 4-Fluoroaniline is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(6).",

Vapor-phase 4-fluoroaniline is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.6X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 4-Fluoroaniline absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that 4-fluoroaniline is expected to have high mobility in soil. The pKa of 4-fluoroaniline is 4.65(4), indicating that this compound is a weak base and will exist predominantly in the non-ionized form in the environment. However, anilines (aromatic amines) are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). In aerobic soil degradation studies, 4-fluoroaniline that was formed as a principal metabolite of herbicide degradation, was observed to bind rapidly to soil(6).",

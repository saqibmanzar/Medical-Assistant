When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Mortality of 163 exposed employees was compared with that in 790 who were not exposed by first using the rates of mortality for England and Wales and then by using regression models in life tables. Cumulative exposure, age at start of employment in the factory, and age at death were considered. Compared with mortality rates in England and Wales, exposed workers had significantly elevated standard mortality ratios for all causes and all cancers, while the regression models indicated that an increased risk of cancer mortality was found for exposed workers who had first been employed before 1951. Cancers among the exposed employees concerned the mouth and throat, digestive system, respiratory system, genitourinary system, and lymphatic hemopoietic tissue. Although exposures were to several chlorinated toluenes, results from this study and previous studies indicates that benzotrichloride was the most likely carcinogen. /It was concluded/ that there is an increased risk of mortality from cancer among the workers, increased risk of mortality from cancer among the workers, especially those employed before 1951, who were exposed to chlorinated toluenes.",

Groups of females were exposed to average concentrations of 0, 42.5, 40.4, 45.0, 43.0 or 46.0 mg/kg and sacrificed 8, 24, 24, 48, or 72 hrs after dosing, respectively. Groups of males were exposed to average concentrations of 0 or 39.9 mg/kg and sacrificed 72 hrs after dosing. BTC was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and efficiently eliminated in the urine (90%) and feces (10%) in 48 hrs. Radioactivity (as BTC equivalents) in the blood peaked at 6.5 ppm by 4 hrs after dosing and then steadily decreased to 2.6 ppm by 24 hrs. The elimination half-life of 14C in the blood was 22 hr. Total radiocarbon residue in tissues was approximately 1.5% of the dose after 72 hrs with fat, liver, and kidneys containing the highest residue levels. The pharmacokinetics of BTC appeared to follow a one-compartment open model system. BTC was rapidly distributed in the body and then eliminated in the urine following apparent first order kinetics. BTC was rapidly metabolized, apparently being hydrolyzed to benzoic acid which was then conjugated with glycine to form hippuric acid (> 90% of radiocarbon in urine). Small amounts of benzoic acid (0.7%) and phenylacetic acid (0.8%), as well as 4 unidentified metabolites (5.5%) were also found in the urine.",

Still bottoms from the distillation of benzyl chloride contain benzotrichloride, but are disposed of in hazardous waste land disposal sites. Benzotrichloride's production and use in organic synthesis as the source of the benzenyl group, to make benzotrifluoride, hydroxybenzophone, pharmaceuticals, antimicrobial agents, chlorinated toluenes, dyes, and pesticides may also result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to soil, direct photolysis is not expected to occur. Benzotrichloride hydrolyzes quickly in the presence of moisture forming benzoic acid and hydrochloric acid with half-lives of 11 sec at pH of 7 and 3 minutes at 5.1 \u00b0C. Therefore, leaching, volatilization from moist soil, and biodegradation are not expected to be important fate processes. If released to water, volatilization, bioconcentration, adsorption to sediment, and photolysis are not expected to be important fate processes due to the rapid hydrolysis rate. Limited biodegradation data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of benzotrichloride in water; however, using a modified OECD-Screening-Test, DOC removal with benzotrichloride was 95-97% after 3 days. However, because of the rapid hydrolysis rate, this biodegradation study is probably for benzoic acid, the hydrolysis product of benzotrichloride. If released to the atmosphere, benzotrichloride will exist in the vapor phase. Vapor-phase benzotrichloride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 45 days. Particulate-phase benzotrichloride may be physically removed from the air by wet deposition. Direct photolysis is not expected to occur in the troposphere. Due to the rapid hydrolysis of benzotrichloride in water, it may hydrolyze in the atmosphere when contacted with moisture. Occupational exposure probably occurs during manufacture and use. (SRC)",

The hydrolysis rate constant at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7 is reported to be 0.063 1/sec(2), which corresponds to a half-life of 11 sec(SRC). The hydrolysis rate constant at 5.10 \u00b0C was found to be 0.00387 per sec(3), which corresponds to a half-life of 3.0 minutes(SRC). Therefore, volatilization, bioconcentration, adsorption to sediment, and photolysis are not expected to be important fate processes(SRC). Limited biodegradation data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of benzotrichloride in water(SRC); however, using a modified OECD-Screening-Test, DOC removal with benzotrichloride was 95-97% after 3 days(4). However, because of the rapid hydrolysis rate, this biodegradation study is probably for benzoic acid, the hydrolysis product of benzotrichloride(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 8.8 hours(2,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 7 days(2,SRC). However, due to the rapid hydrolysis of benzotrichloride in water(3-5), volatilization from water is not expected to be important(SRC). Benzotrichloride's vapor pressure(6) indicates that volatilization from dry soil surfaces may occur(SRC).",

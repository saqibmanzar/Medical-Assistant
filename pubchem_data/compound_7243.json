ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Skin absorption of the dyes was observed when they were applied in an aqueous solution. With one exception, the octanol/water partition coefficients were in the same rank order as the permeability constants. The determination of the partitioning of the hair dyes between water and either stratum corneum or epidermis was more complex. Preliminary stratum corneum/water partition studies resulted in values that were in the reverse order of skin permeation. When binding of the compounds to components of the membrane was saturated, the partition values more closely duplicated the rank order of permeability of the dyes. Prediction of percutaneous absorption of substances based on their partition coefficients may be confounded if these compounds are capable of binding to skin.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Bodyweight, feed consumption, clinical signs, functional observational battery performance, fore- and hindlimb grip strength, foot splay and motor activity were assessed prior to treatment (baseline values), and at 1 hour, 24 hours, and 4 days post-treatment. Toxicity was demonstrated at all dose levels. High-dose rats, 2 males and 4 females were found dead prior to scheduled sacrifice and significant weight loss within one day of dosing was common to all treatment groups, persisting throughout Day 4. Significant reductions in feed consumption were pronounced initially, but transient in all but the high-dose group. Clinical signs were most severe 2-4 days after treatment and included initial discolored urine, abnormal respiration with gasping, congestion, and sneezing (450, 900 mg/kg), dose-related malaise, postural changes, palpebral closure, and decreased arousal. The functional observational battery, fore-, and hindlimb grip strength and foot splay assessments were not indicative of a neurotoxicity at any treatment level. Motor activity was significantly depressed following treatment in all treatment groups relative to control. Study investigators attributed these findings to a general condition of dose-related malaise and reported no evidence of specific toxic effects on the central nervous system.",

In daphnid tests, the nominal 48 hr EC50s were 0.28, 0.87 and 5.9 mg/L for p-pda, o-pda and m-pda, respectively. The nominal 96 hr EC50s in algae were 0.28, 0.16, and 2.4 mg/L for p-pda, o-pda and m-pda, respectively. With oxygenation, the times to reach 1/2 initial concentrations were 4 to 9 hr for p-pda, 650 to 1,100 hr for o-pda and 3,200 to 8,100 hr for m-pda. Results suggest that acute toxicities of pdas are related to their chemical reactivities (degradative rates) and that pdas may degrade rapidly under environmental conditions."

The rank order of the mutagenicity of the isomers was: o-phenylenediamine > m-phenylenediamine > p-phenylenediamine with corresponding mutagenic potencies of 5.60, 1.43, and 0.46 mutant stamen hair cells/mumole, respectively. Diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC) and ammonium meta-vanadate (vanadate) repressed the mutagenic activity of o-phenylenediamine (o-PDA) in intact plants. Based on inhibition kinetics and reaction rates, the mechanism of DEDTC antimutagenicity was attributed to the inhibition of peroxidases that are required in the plant activation of o-PDA to mutagenic product(s). Spectrophotometric measurements of equimolar concentrations of o-PDA and vanadate demonstrated that the antimutagenic property of vanadate was mainly due to its reactivity with o-PDA.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.06X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates o-phenylenediamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase o-phenylenediamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.7 hrs. o-Phenylenediamine absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, o-phenylenediamine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 34. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.2X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. o-Phenylenediamine may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A 100% of total decomposition required greater than 64 days using a soil inoculum, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, o-phenylenediamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. o-Phenylenediamine exhibited 33% removal after 5 days incubation using acclimated activated sludge inoculum, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process for the neutral species based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. The pKa values of <2 and 4.47 indicate o-phenylenediamine will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to o-phenylenediamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where o-phenylenediamine is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to o-phenylenediamine via dermal contact with consumer products containing o-phenylenediamine. (SRC)",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

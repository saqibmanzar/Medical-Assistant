When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

[2] Short-term exposure limit (PEL-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The subjects did not know if they were exposed or not. Three times (morning, noon, evening) during these 8 hr, mood [Profile of Mood States (POMS)], neurobehavioral performance (reaction, Stroop, nonverbal learning, determination, tracking; Wiener Test System), vision (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color sensitivity) and postural sway were tested. During an undemanding test (POMS) and a demanding performance task (determination test), pulse, electromyography (EMG) of the forehead and of the neck were recorded. In the morning and evening spirometry [forced vital capacity (FVC), forced one-second expiration volume (FEV1), medium expiration flow (MEF) and peak expiration flow (PEF)] and the odor perception threshold were measured. In the evening, in the exposed group, fatigue was significantly increased and the EMG of the forehead during a demanding task showed a different development during exposure. The other tests showed no significant solvent effect, but 16 of 43 test parameters showed a significant effect of time.  ...",

Methyl formate's use as a fumigant and larvicide will result in its direct release to the environment. Methyl formate was identified as a flavor component in tomato fruit, as an aroma substance in apples, in the volatiles of chicken, beef, and pork flavor, and in brewed, roasted, and dried coffee. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.9X10+2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl formate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl formate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 71 days. Methyl formate did not undergo direct photolysis when irradiated with UV light >300 nm. If released to soil, methyl formate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 25. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl formate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, methyl formate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.3 hours and 4.0 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important fate process under environmental conditions with estimated half-life values of 5.1 and 12 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to methyl formate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl formate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methyl formate via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

Volatilization of methyl formate from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.3 hours and 4.0 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3.2(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Hydrolysis is expected to be an important fate process for methyl formate. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 16 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(7); this corresponds to half-lives of 5.1 and 12 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

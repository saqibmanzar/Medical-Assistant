The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The uptake of propylene into the body of rats has been found to be low. Clearance due to uptake, reflecting the rate of transfer of propylene from the atmosphere into the organism, was 19 mL/min for one rat weighing 250 g. This value represents only 16% of the alveolar ventilation (117 mL/min). Most propylene inhaled into the lungs is exhaled again and does not reach the blood to become systemically available. Maximal accumulation of propylene in the same rat, determined as the thermodynamic partition coefficient for whole body:air (Keq=Conc.animal/Conc.air), was only 1.6. At concentrations below 50 ppm [86 mg/cu m], the concentration ratio at steady-state whole body:air was even smaller (0.7), owing to metabolic elimination. At these concentrations, first-order kinetics were found, and clearance due to metabolism in relation to the concentration in the atmosphere was calculated to be 11 mL/min for a 250-g rat. Thus, at steady state, about 58% of systemically available propylene is eliminated metabolically and 42% is eliminated by exhalation as the unchanged substance. No corresponding data have been published for mice. In rats and mice, the rate of propylene metabolism showed saturation kinetics, with maximal metabolic rates (Vmax) of 0.17 umol/(min x 250 g bw) [1.7 mg/(hr x kg bw)] and 8 mg/(hr xkg bw) and atmospheric concentrations at Vmax/2 of 260 ppm (447 mg/cu m) and 800 ppm (1376 mg/cu m), respectively.",

Metabolism was simulated to occur in the liver (90%) and in the richly perfused tissue group (10%). The partition coefficients tissue:air were determined in vitro using tissues of mice, rats, and humans. Most of the tissues have partition coefficients of around 0.5. Only adipose tissue displays a 10 times higher value. The partition coefficient blood:air in human is 0.44, about half of that in rodents. PE can accumulate in the organism only barely. For male B6C3F1 mice and male Fischer 344/N rats, parameters of PE metabolism were obtained from gas uptake experiments. Maximum rates of metabolism (V(maxmo)) were 110 umol/hr/kg in mice and 50.4 umol/hr/kg in rats. V(maxmo)/2 was reached in mice at 270 ppm and in rats at 400 ppm of atmospheric PE. Pretreatment of the animals with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate resulted in an almost complete inhibition of PE metabolism in both species. Preliminary toxicokinetic data on PE metabolism in humans were obtained in one volunteer who was exposed up to 4.5 hr to constant concentrations of 5 and 25 ppm PE. The PT model was used to calculate PE blood concentrations at steady state. At 25 ppm, the blood values were comparable across species, with 0.19, 0.32, and 0.34 umol/L for mouse, rat, and human, respectively. However, the corresponding rates of PE metabolism differed dramatically, being 8.3, 2.1, and 0.29 umol/hr/kg in mouse, rat, and human. For a repeated human exposure to 25 ppm PE in air (8 hr/day, 5 days/wk), PE concentrations in venous blood were simulated. The prediction demonstrates that PE is eliminated so rapidly that it cannot accumulate in the organism. For low exposure concentrations, it became obvious that the rate of uptake into blood by inhalation is limited by the blood flow through the lung and the rate of metabolism is limited by the blood flow through the metabolizing organs.",

Epoxidation by a reconstituted cytochrome P450LM2 system including cytochrome P450 reductase proceeded with a concomitant, stereospecific (trans to the alkyl group) hydrogen/deuterium exchange from the aqueous phase when trans-1-deuterio-propylene in H2O or propylene in D2O (pH 7.4, 4 \u00b0C) was used. Both enantiomers of propylene oxide were found after incubation (37 \u00b0C, pH 7.4) of propylene with an NADPH-regenerating system and microsomes prepared from livers of male Wistar rats (control and phenobarbital-pretreated animals) and male NMRI/HAN mice (control, phenobarbital- and benzo[a]pyrene-pretreated animals). Epoxide hydrolase activity was inhibited in those incubates which contained trichloropropylene oxide. In incubations with liver microsomes of rats, about 30% of R- and about 70% of S-enantiomer were formed, whereas with mouse microsomes the amounts of the two enantiomers were nearly equal: R, 42-55%; S, 45-58%, depending on the pretreatment.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Refinery cracking processes operate either purely thermally or thermally-catalytically. By far the most important refinery process for propene production is the fluid-catalytic cracking (FCC) process, in which the powdery catalyst flows as a fluidized bed through the reaction and regeneration phases. This process converts heavy gas oil preferentially into gasoline and light gas oil. Catalysts utilized in FCC units can be modified to produce more propene. Typical propene yields in conventional FCC units are 3%, which can be increased up to 20% by modification of the catalyst by addition of ZSM-5 zeolite to the FCC catalyst. ... As all FCC streams contain contaminants for further processing of the propene, purification to the specified quality (chemical grade or polymer grade) is required.",

The metathesis process for the production of propene is based on WO3/SiO2 catalysts. ... The reaction principle was originally applied for the production of ethylene from propene and was developed in the 1960s by Phillips (Triolefin process). In this process, propene was converted into ethylene and 2-butene. With growing demand for propene, the production was stopped in 1972. When the prices for propene increased, reversing the equilibrium reaction became attractive. ... Currently, approximately 3% of the propene production are based on metathesis.",

All equipment used when handling the product must be grounded. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Stop leak if you can do it without risk. If possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid. Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled material. Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. CAUTION: For LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972), DO NOT apply water, regular or alcohol-resistant foam directly on spill. Use a high-expansion foam if available to reduce vapors. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2024)",

                                "Description": "The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical is an airborne concentration at which a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effect.  There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957), Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) and Methane (UN1971) are lighter than air and will rise.  Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket.",

The events contributing to uncontrolled release of propylene from a polypropylene plant in Norway were reported. The exit valves in a polypropylene reactor at the Saga Petrokjemi factory became plugged with the polymer. The factory was shut down, propylene was boiled off, and the reactor was purged with nitrogen six times. The top manholes were open. The temperature at the bottom of the reactor was 0 \u00b0C at the time the reactor started to be filled with water, then it dropped to minus 50 \u00b0C. Injection of steam into reactor jacket increased the temperature to minus 30 \u00b0C. The gas emission increased and propylene leaked into the control room around cable ducts. The filling of the reactor with water continued for about 3 hours at which point a concentrated release of propylene and nitrogen occurred with a bang. One hour later the reactor was closed, the contents were heated to 10 \u00b0C, and again purged with nitrogen. The major factors contributing to the release of the gaseous mixture from the reactor were believed to be the presence of gaseous and liquid propylene pockets dispersed in a high volume of the polymer powder, lower temperatures in the reactor, and malfunctioning of the ventilator system.",

It is used in manufacture of isopropyl alcohol, polypropylene, synthetic glycerol, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, heptene, cumene, polymer gasoline, acrylic acid, vinyl resins, oxo chemicals. It is also used as aerosol propellant and component. Formerly used in dental surgery as temporary anesthetic. HUMAN STUDIES: In the gaseous state propylene is not irritating to the skin or eyes based on limited human studies. However, should skin or eye contact occur to this chemical in its liquid state, tissue freezing, severe cold burn, and/or frostbite may result. ANIMAL STUDIES: No adverse effects were observed in repeated dose inhalation toxicity studies in rodents at concentrations up to 10,000 ppm propylene, for 14 weeks. Furthermore, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats or mice exposed to propylene concentrations as high as 10,000 ppm for up to 103 weeks. Inflammation of the nasal cavity was the only indication of toxicity observed following exposure of male rats to 5,000 and 10,000 ppm propylene and female rats exposed to 10,000 propylene for 103 weeks. These effects were not observed when rats were exposed to similar concentrations for 14 weeks. Mutagenic activity was observed in a single bacterial strain in the Ames assay in the presence of metabolic activation. Inhalation exposure of pregnant Wistar rats to propylene from implantation to one day prior to the expected day of parturition (days 6-19 p.c.) elicited no maternal toxicity, prenatal or developmental toxicity, or teratogenicity at all tested concentrations up to 10,000 ppm.",

Other groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex in chambers received air only on the same schedule and served as chamber controls. The highest concentration of propylene that was considered safe for these studies was 10,000 ppm because of risk of explosion, that can occur at higher concentrations. ... Hemangiosarcomas were found in one low-dose male mouse (liver), two high-dose male mice (spleen), and three high-dose female mice (subcutis, spleen, and uterus). Hemangiomas were found in one low-dose and in one high-dose female mouse (liver). ...

In addition, propylene is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass and the burning of cigarettes. Natural sources of propylene are the volatile components of garlic oil, Scotch firs, European firs, and germinating seeds such as beans, corn, cotton, and pea seeds. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 8590 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propylene will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase propylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 hrs. Propylene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, propylene is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 22. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.196 atm-cu m/mole. Propylene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil of water were not available. However, propylene was biodegraded to propylene oxide using acclimated cell free extracts. If released into water, propylene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hrs and 3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to propylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propylene is produced or used.  Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to propylene via inhalation of ambient air, since propylene is widely found in air samples along roadways, city streets, and restaurants.

Gas-phase propylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.9X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Gas-phase propylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 23 hrs(4), calculated from its rate constant of 1.2X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(5). Propylene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The rate of epoxidation to 1,2-epoxypropane ranged from 0.3 to 6.10 umol/hr per mg of protein. Using Brevibacterium, propylene oxide was formed at a rate of 0.52 umol/10 min-mg protein(1). Propylene was utilized by Mycobacterium convolution acclimated to propane with 56 uL O2 taken up/mg cells-hour in the Warburg test, resulting in production of acrylic acid. However, the latter did cause inhibition of growth(2). Cell-free cultures of Methylosinaus trichosporium and Methylococcus capsulatus, isolated from lake water from Warinanaco Park, Linden NJ and from lake and soil samples from Bayway Refinery, Linden, NJ and acclimated to methane, were found to convert propylene to propylene oxide at a rate ranging from 2.5 to 5.5 umol/hr per mg of protein(3,4).",

Propylene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Propylene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In 1982, propylene was found in the Gulf of Mexico near the mouth of the Mississippi River and the discharge waters from an offshore oil production facility; concentrations were 67.1 and 91.9 nL/L in two separate samples taken by different sampling stations in the Gulf of Mexico(4). In April 1985, propylene was detected in several water samples taken from the Indian Ocean near Madagascar and the coast of Africa, concentrations ranged from 2.5-15 ppb(3). A 1992 study of water samples from the mid-Atlantic found propylene concentrations ranging from 73-125 pmol/L from 35 deg N to 8 deg N and 31-78 pmol/L from 8 deg N to 30 deg S(2).",

In another study, emissions of propylene from various gasoline fueled engines averaged 95.29 mg/km driven in an urban area, 61.32 mg/km driven in a suburban area, 46.79 mg/km driven in a rural area, and 44.44-50.46 mg/km driven on a motorway(3). Furthermore, emissions of propylene increased from about 2.8 to about 6.5% of total hydrocarbon content (THC) when the speed increased from 20 km/hr to about 115 km/hr(3). Propylene concentrations ranged from 0.038-0.19 ppm in air containing automotive emissions(4). Propylene was qualitatively identified in emissions from burning polyethylene(5) and samples of volcanic gases from Kunashir Island, U.S.S.R(6). The average concentration of propylene in the Lincoln Tunnel (connecting Weehawhen, NJ with Manhattan Island, NY) was 630.1 ppbC in 1970 and 122.4 ppbC in 1982(7).",

Emissions of propylene from GM's first variable-fuel vehicle using methanol/gasoline mixtures were 0.8 mg/mi (100% methanol), 2.5 mg/mi (85% methanol), 7.8 mg/mi (50% methanol), 10.0 mg/mi (15% methanol), and 10.7 mg/mi (0% methanol)(5). The contribution of vehicle emissions from an attached garage to residential indoor propylene levels was studied using a 1993 Buick Regal. Propylene emission rates (mg/test) at cold start were 300 at -10 \u00b0C, 150 at 0 \u00b0C, and 150 at 24 \u00b0C(6). Propylene was reported at 2.20, 2.19 and 1.19% of total VOC species in exhaust from light-, medium- and heavy-duty diesel trucks, respectively, in Beijing, China. In 2012, the number of vehicles in Beijing numbered 5 million of which 4% where diesel(7).",

Average monthly concentrations of propylene ranged from 1.1 to 15.3 ppbV for 1985 in atmospheric samples taken at Deonar, India(2). Propylene was detected in Tulsa, OK air on July 27, 1978 at average concentration ranges of 4.2-5.6, 2.8-3.2, and 27.5-109.9 ppbC downwind from the health department, post office, and the Texaco refinery, respectively(3). Average propylene concentrations in urban air were 22.2 ppbC in Sydney, Australia during Sept 1979-June 1980(4), 17.0 ppbC in Houston, TX, USA during July 1976(5), 14.0 ppbC in Upland, CA, USA during June-Sept 1975(6), 8.0 ppbC in Washington D.C., USA during July-August 1980(7), and 5.1 ppbC in Lancaster, England during June-July 1983(7). In May of 1976, propylene was detected at a concentration range of 0.3-1.0 ppbC at 6 of 7 sites in St. Petersburg/Tampa, the Everglades, and Miami, FL(8). A study conducted in Edmonton, Alberta 1991-1993 found a median of 2.67 ug/ cu m of propylene in 212 air samples taken in the downtown area (9). In 1993-94 twelve air samples collected in Athens, Greece found an average propylene concentration of 3.9 ppb, at a sampling station 4 m above ground(10). A study of Washington D.C. baseline volatile organic compounds from 1990 to 1991 collected samples every 6 days and propylene was found in 93% of the samples with an average concentration of 1.94 ppb(11). A study conducted in London examined air contaminants from the summer of 1991 to the summer of 1992 with propylene concentrations ranging from 2.6-19.6 ppbv; samples were collected each day for 30 minutes per hour(12).",

In the United Kingdom, propylene concentration in the air of a rural area over a two year period varied from 0.17-8.2 ug/cu m, with a mean concentration of 1.19 ug/cu m(6). A 1991 study of low molecular weight volatile organics in four rural locations in Canada found propylene concentrations ranging from 0.02-0.31 ppb (Saturna Island, British Columbia), 0.01-0.10 ppb (Egbert, Ontario), 0.01-0.10 ppb (Lac la Flamme, Quebec), and 0.01-0.17 ppb (Kejimkujik National Park, Nova Scotia); samples were taken over a 1 year time period 2-3 times per week(7). In April of 1985, propylene was detected in several samples of air above the Indian Ocean along the coast of Madagascar and Africa at a concentration range of 0.22-11.19 ppbv(8).",

The average ambient concentration of propylene in the Houston, TX ship channel industrial complex was 10.7 ppbv during Sept 1987-Sept 1988(3). During 1999 an air quality study in Cairo, Egypt found propene in a median concentration of 0.17% and 0.28% in an unspecified number of samples taken at a lead smelter and a cast iron factory, respectively (4). Five air samples collected in 1992 at a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Sweden found that 100 m downwind propylene was present at a concentration of 5.7-10.5% of total non-methane hydrocarbons by weight(5). The same study found a propylene concentration of 0.8-2.5% by weight in 2 samples taken near other unspecified refinery units(5). A study of restaurants in Mexico found propylene concentrations from 2.55-3.81 ppb depending on the type of restaurant (rotisserie (2.55 ppb), tortilleria (3.81 ppb), fried food (2.92 ppb), average restaurant(2.77 ppb)); sampling was conducted in one or two restaurants of each type and lasted from 1-4 hours(6).

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

One hundred and thirty-four adult subjects completed the 2-week experimental gingivitis model study. Following baseline examinations, which included plaque index, modified gingival index and gingival bleeding index, subjects received a full dental prophylaxis. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three mouthwashes (hexetidine 0.1%, chlorhexidine 0.12% (positive control) or a 5% hydroalcohol negative control) and commenced three times daily supervised rinsing as their sole method of oral hygiene. All indices were rescored after 2 weeks. Compared to the negative control group, the hexetidine group demonstrated a statistically significant inhibition and reduction of supragingival plaque and gingival inflammation with reductions of 6.3%, 33.5% and 56% for gingivitis, plaque and gingival bleeding, respectively. The results of the chlorhexidine group were used to validate the study. The study confirms the efficacy of a hexetidine rinse in reducing supragingival plaque and gingival inflammation.",

The bitter taste is least affected, whereas the effects on salty and acidic tastes range between that for sweet and bitter.

The study was a 5 treatment, single blind cross over design involving 15 healthy subjects using orange juice, as a drink, and water, as a rinse, as positive and negative controls respectively. 2 enamel specimens from unerupted human third molar teeth were placed in the palatal area of upper removable acrylic appliances which were worn from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday for 3 weeks. Rinses were used 2x daily and 250 ml volumes of orange juice were imbibed 4x daily. Enamel loss was determined by profilometry on days 5, 10 and 15. The study in vitro involved immersing specimens in the 4 test solutions together with a reduced acid acidified sodium chlorite formulation for a period of 4 hr under constant stirring; Enamel loss was measured by profilometry every hour. Enamel loss was in situ progressive over time with the 3 rinses and orange juice but negligible with water. Acidified sodium chlorite produced similar erosion to orange juice and significantly more than the two proprietary rinses and water. The essential oil and hexetidine rinses produced similar erosion and significantly more than water. Enamel loss in vitro was progressive over time, and the order from low to high erosion was reduced acid acidified sodium chlorite, acidified sodium chlorite, Essential oil, and hexetidine mouthrinses and orange juice. Based on the study in situ, it is recommended that low pH mouthrinses should not be considered for long term or continuous use and never as pre-brushing rinses. In view of the plaque inhibitory efficacy of acidified sodium chlorite, short- to medium-term applications similar to those of chlorhexidine would be envisaged.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

The major nitrosamine product, \"HEXNO\", forms rapidly in yields as high as 60% over the pH range 1-4.8 at incubation times of 1 hr at 37 degrees C with 40 mM NO2- and 10 mM hexetidine. On the basis of extensive spectroscopic characterization and independent synthesis HEXNO has been assigned the structure of 1-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-nitroso-4-methyl-4-[[N-(2-ethylhexyl)-N- nitrosoamino]methyl]imidazolidine ...  The rapid formation of HEXNO from hexetidine and hexedine supports the hypothesis that tertiary geminal diamines will produce nitrosamines rapidly by a mechanism which involves the cleavage of a nitrosammonium ion with the assistance of the neighboring nitrogen atom. This process is deemed to be of possible importance in the endogenous production of potentially carcinogenic nitrosamines because of its low nitrite requirement and high nitrosation rate. The available data suggest the probable formation of HEXNO and other nitrosamines from hexetidine under conditions of its use.",

After exposure to increasing dilutions of three proprietary oral rinses for 22 hr or 2 hr, the effects upon cell proliferation were studied by measurement of [3H]-thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA. Cell membrane damage was assessed by measurement of lactate dehydrogenase content. Cultures exposed to hexetidine-containing ...  rinses for 22 hr at dilutions of 250-fold or lower showed almost complete inhibition of [3H]-thymidine incorporation. ... Exposure to the same dilutions of hexetidine-....containing rinses for 2 hr resulted in 65% and 20% inhibition of incorporation, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase content decreased to negligible levels after exposure to the rinse containing hexetidine at a 250-fold dilution ... .  Thus dividing buccal epithelial cells in vitro may be adversely affected by exposure to certain commercial oral rinses.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.54X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates hexetidine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase hexetidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.3 hours. Particulate-phase hexetidine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Hexetidine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, hexetidine is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 1.2X10+5. The pKa of hexetidine is 8.3, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the base exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, hexetidine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A pKa of 8.3 indicates hexetidine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 58 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound does not contain functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to hexetidine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hexetidine is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to hexetidine via ingestion of and dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

A pKa of 8.3(3) indicates hexetidine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 58(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 5.26(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Deposition of methacrylic acid was measured throughout exposure determining the difference in vapor concentration of methacrylic acid in the inspired and the URT expiring air. Deposition rates (from 30 to 60 min of exposure) of about 95% were observed under 200 mL/min unidirectional flow conditions.

AEGLs are used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures.  AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The mixture was 50% glacial methacrylic acid and 50% polymethacrylic acid by weight. The polymethacrylic acid was a polymer as 23% polymethacrylic acid in water. The test mixture was reportedly 37.4% active ingredients but the author did not identify the active ingredients. A control group was also included. Calculations based on the activity of the mixture determined the concentrations delivered as 1.237, 2.886 and 6.185 mg active ingredients/ml water. At 30 and 90 days hematological studies and complete urine analyses were performed on five animals/sex/group. No treatment-related effects were noted with regard to physical appearance, behavior, growth and food consumption in the test animals compared to controls. Water consumption was significantly decreased for the intermediate and high dose males, probably as a result of a decreased palatability because drinking water was the vehicle for the compound. No deaths occurred among the test or control animals. Hematological values were generally within normal limits; however, the total red cell count at termination was decreased in control and test groups and was significantly decreased for the high dose females. Biochemical and urine analyses for the test groups were comparable to control values. Gross and microscopic examination of tissues reported no consistent compound related changes in the organs of test animals.",

The dose of the active ingredients was 0, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day daily for 90 days. The six control dogs were normal throughout the study. The 250 mg/kg group had normal behavior and appearance while on study. No signs of treatment effect were observed in any of the animals and normal body weights were maintained. The 500 mg/kg group had normal behavior and appearance; however, slight weight loss was recorded in 5/6 dogs. The high dose group had an increased frequency of emesis and diarrhea. Hematology, biochemistry and urine analyses were normal for all test animals. At gross necropsy there were no compound related organ changes. Microscopic examination did not indicate any alterations attributable to oral administration of a mixture of glacial methacrylic acid and polymethacrylic acid to Beagle dogs.

Sensitization concentrations for methacrylic acid were 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0%. Dichloronitrobenzene and distilled water were used as the positive and negative control, respectively. Induction was performed in two stages. In the first stage, 50 uL of methacrylic acid was injected into a shaved area on the back, near the neck. An aqueous mixture of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA), methacrylic acid or Methacrylic Acid plus FCA was injected at two sites. The guinea pigs were pretreated with 10% sodium lauryl sulfate in petrolatum for 24 hr during the second stage of induction which occurred two weeks later. Next, a filter paper patch soaked in 200 uL of the test substance was placed on the shaved back of the guinea pig. The patch remained in place for 48 hr. Methacrylic acid, 100 uL undiluted, was applied topically on day 22 as the challenge test. The hair on the flank was shaved and methacrylic acid was applied to the skin by the closed-patch testing technique. The challenge site was evaluated 24 hr after removal of the patch. The results from the sensitization experiments determined that a 0.2% concentration of Methacrylic Acid was to be used in the elicitation test. The challenge concentrations were 10, 25, 50 and 100% (5 animals/group) and were applied to four points on each animal. Skin reactions were evaluated after 24 and 48 h. All concentrations of Methacrylic Acid caused strong rubefaction and scab formation. The investigators had difficulty determining if these were type IV hypersensitivity reactions or simple irritation. All guinea pigs had significant responses, 7/7 on the scale used. Elicitation tests indicated that as the concentration of methacrylic acid increased, the response increased. methacrylic acid produced rubefaction at all concentrations tested.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.99 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methacrylic acid will exist solely as a vapor. Vapor-phase methacrylic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hours. Vapor-phase methacrylic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone; the half-life for this reaction is estimated to be about 2.3 days. Methacrylic acid does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methacrylic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an average Koc of 15. A pKa 4.65, indicates that methacrylic acid will exist primarily in its anionic form under environmental conditions (pH 5-9) and will be nonvolatile from moist soil surfaces. Methacrylic acid is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Screening tests indicate that methacrylic acid is readily biodegradable; it reached 53% of its theoretical BOD in 5 days using a sewage inoculum. If released into water, methacrylic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its average Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process since methacrylic acid will exist primarily in its anion form under environmental conditions. An estimated BCF of 3.1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Methacrylic acid was determined to be stable to hydrolysis at pH 3, 7, and 11. Occupational exposure to methacrylic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methacrylic acid is produced or used. Use data suggest that the general population may be exposed to methacrylic acid via inhalation dermal contact with consumer products contianing this compound. (SRC)",

A pKa 4.65(3), indicates that methacrylic acid will exist essentially in its anionic form under environmental conditions (pH 5-9) and will be nonvolatile from water surfaces(SRC). Methacrylic acid was determined to be stable to hydrolysis at pH 3, 7, and 11(2). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 3.1(SRC), from a log Kow of 0.93(5) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Screening tests indicate that methacrylic acid is readily biodegradable(7-9); it reached 53% of its theoretical BOD in 5 days using a sewage inoculum(7).",

Vapor-phase methacrylic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.9X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of methacrylic acid with ozone is 4.1X10-18 cu cm/molecule-sec at 23 \u00b0C(4). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2.3 days(SRC) at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(5). Methacrylic acid does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

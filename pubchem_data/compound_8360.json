ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

[2] Short-term exposure limit (PEL-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday.

                                "Description": "The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical is an airborne concentration at which a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effect.  There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is found on List C. Case No: 3055; Pesticide type: fungicide, herbicide, antimicrobial; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document.; Active ingredient (AI): dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 05/03/93; AI Status: The producers of the pesticide has made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.4X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days. Particulate-phase 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 1,3-Dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 140. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 1,3-Dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based on its estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 50 and 370 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 19 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Upon exposure to water 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin will slowly release hypochlorous acid. At pH 9 nitrogen chloride is formed from 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin solutions. Occupational exposure to 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is produced or used. The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is by dermal contact with bleaches containing this substance or in swimming pools that use this substance as a chlorine source.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 50 and 370 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 19(SRC), from its water solubility(2)and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Upon exposure to water 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin will slowly release hypochlorous acid. At pH 9 nitrogen chloride is formed from 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin solutions(6). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2006).",

Vapor-phase 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.1X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). 1,3-Dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

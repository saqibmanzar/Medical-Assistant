Blood was drawn from females treated with 4 mg/kg at 1, 4, 8, 17, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr after dosing. Urine and feces were collected daily in the Group 1, 3 and 4 rats. Animals were sacrificed 17, 96, 192 and 192 hr, respectively, after treatment, and selected tissues were excised. Regardless of sex, the primary route of excretion was the feces, 70% of the administered dose being eliminated within the first 72 hr. Only 10% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine. After 192 hr, the maximum residues present in any tissue were <0.1 mg/kg, with the exception of the fat (0.121 mg/kg) and liver (0.296 mg/kg). The blood concentration of chlorendic anhydride peaked 1 hr after dosing and was significantly decreased by 96 hr. The absorption of chlorendic anhydride followed the two-compartment open model. The first compartment was suggested to consist of the blood and selected tissues which equilibrated rapidly, while the second compartment consisted of the fat which was slow in equilibrating and considered a deep reservoir.",

Three high-dosed females died between the fifth and thirteenth week of the study. Mid- and high-dose males and high-dose females had a decreased food consumption, and the mean body weight of mid- and high-dose males and all three treated female groups was decreased, compared to controls. Treated males and females had elevated serum alkaline phosphatase activities at 1, 2 and 3 months of the study. The mean absolute heart weight of male rats and the mean absolute and relative liver weight of male and female rats were statistically significantly decreased at all treatment levels.

Animals were sacrificed 17, 96, 192 and 192 hours post treatment and selected tissue were excised. Regardless of sex, the primary route of excretion was the feces, with 70% of the administered dose being eliminated with in the first 72 hours. Only 10% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine. After 192 hours, the maximum residues present in any tissue were less than 0.10ppm with the exception of the fat (0.121ppm) and liver (0.296ppm). Blood concentrations of chlorendic anhydride peaked one hour after dosing and was significantly decreased by 96 hours. The absorption of chlorendic anhydride followed the two compartment open model. The first compartment was suggested to consist of the blood and selected tissue which equilibrated rapidly. While the second compartment consisted of the fat which was slow in equilibrating and considered a deep reservoir. The half life of the radiocarbon was less than 2 days except for fat (22.5 days).",

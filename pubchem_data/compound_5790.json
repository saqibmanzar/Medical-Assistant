When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Due to the structural similarities, antimetabolites act as pyrimidine-like molecules and prevent normal pyrimidines from being incorporated into DNA. After successful biotransformation, floxuridine is converted into an active component, flurouracil, which blocks the enzyme which converts cytosine nucleosides into the deoxy derivative. Flurouracil also physically prevents the incorporation of thymidine nucleotides into the DNA strand by taking their place, further preventing DNA synthesis.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Inherited deficiency of this enzyme leads to greatly increased sensitivity to the drug. The product of this reaction, 5-fluoro-5,6-dihydrouracil is ultimately degraded to alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine ... .",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Floxuridine can also form 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP), which is the monophosphate of floxuridine that inhibits thymidylate synthetase that plays a role in the methylation of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid during DNA synthesis.

The monophosphate of the drug, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP), inhibits thymidylate synthetase, thus inhibiting methylation of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid and thereby interfering with the synthesis of DNA. Following administration of a single dose of floxuridine, the drug is catabolized to fluorouracil and produces the same antimetabolic effects as the latter drug.  In addition to interfering with DNA synthesis, metabolites of fluorouracil become incorporated to a small extent into RNA, producing a fraudulent RNA. Fluorouracil also inhibits utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis by blocking uracil riboside phosphorylase.",

Several routes are available for the formation of the 5'-monophosphate nucleotide in animal cells. Fluorouracil may be converted to fluorouridine by uridine phosphorylase and then to 5'-monophosphate nucleotide by uridine kinase or it may react directly with 5-phosphoribosyl- 1 -pyrophosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme orotate phosphoribosyl transferase, to form 5'-monophosphate nucleotide. Fluorouracil may also be converted directly to floxuridine by the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase. Many metabolic pathways are available to 5'-monophosphate nucleotide, including incorporation into RNA. A reaction sequence crucial for antineoplastic activity involves reduction of the diphosphate nucleotide by the enzyme ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase to the deoxynucleotide level and the eventual formation of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate. This complex metabolic pathway for the generation of the actual growth inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate, may be bypassed through use of the deoxyribonucleoside of fluorouracil--floxuridine--which is converted directly to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate by thymidine kinase. However, floxuridine is a good substrate for both thymidine and uridine phosphorylases. and it can also be degraded to fluorouracil.",

The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

These elevations are generally mild to moderate in severity and resolve with stopping therapy. \"Chemical hepatitis,\" however, not infrequently is a cause of dose modification or delay in cycles of treatment. In addition, prolonged or repeated hepatic arterial infusions of FUDR can cause acalculous cholecystitis and multiple biliary strictures that can cause jaundice and a chronic sclerosing cholangitis-like syndrome. Between 5% and 25% of patients treated with hepatic arterial infusions of FUDR will develop symptomatic biliary strictures with pain and jaundice. These typically arise after 2 to 6 months of therapy, but can appear later, even more than a year after initiating FUDR therapy. The biliary strictures typically affect central bile ducts in the area of the porta hepatis, generally in and around the bifurcation of the common hepatic duct. Similar inflammation and fibrosis account for the acalculous cholecystitis that can occur with FUDR therapy, but which can be avoided by cholecystectomy at the time of hepatic resection of metastases or placement of the intraarterial infusion pump. The biliary strictures generally improve with stopping therapy, but can progress or require endoscopic or surgical intervention. Deaths from progressive biliary strictures and cholestatic liver injury have been described and can be a major cause of death among survivors of this metastatic tumor. The frequency of biliary strictures after FUDR therapy may be decreased by concurrent administration of dexamethasone and avoided by monitoring with hepatic and biliary imaging. However, the many complications of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy have decreased enthusiasm for this therapy, particularly with newer, more potent systemic antineoplastic agents.",

Floxuridine 0.3 mg/kg/day was infused for 49 to 77 days each, as a continuous infusion. Cholangiograms were performed before and after infusion, and weekly liver function tests were obtained. The results were compared to dogs (N= 6) that received hepatic arterial floxuridine 0.3 mg/kg/day X 30 days, and dogs (N= 5) that received hepatic arterial saline for 100 days. Elevation in the serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase, indistinguishable from the hepatic arterial group, was seen in all four dogs with portal vein infusion. Maximum bilirubin levels ranged from 0.6 to 3.0 (mean 1.7), compared to a range of 6.4 to 28 (mean 13.4) for the hepatic arterial dogs. Cholangiograms demonstrated hepatic volume loss consistent with hepatocellular injury, but no biliary sclerosis. These data suggest that sclerosing cholangitis resulting from intra-arterial infusion of floxuridine is unlikely to be due to metabolites of the drug excreted in the bile, but due to direct toxicity to the biliary tree.",

Uninjected and saline injected eggs served as controls. Dosages used were 0.024, 0.026, 0.028, 0.03, or 0.036 ug/egg at a concentration of 2X10(-4) g fluorodeoxyuridine/L of Howard's saline. On the tenth day of incubation the embryos were inspected for gross defects and then fixed, stained and cleared for skeletal study. All of the doses were teratogenic except the largest dose which was lethal. The most common skeletal defects were observed in vertebrae and limbs. Defects were also noted in the pelvis and mandible. Frequently, the limbs of treated embryos featured prominent hematomas. A second group of embryos were treated on the third day of incubation with 0.026 up of fluorodeoxyuridine and prepared for light and scanning electron microscopy on the fourth to the ninth days. There were early indications of hematomas in the limb buds and the frontal region of the head on the fourth day. On the fifth day definitive hematomas were observed int he limbs, frontal region, and in the lumbo-sacral region. Scanning electron micrographs revealed blood-filled blisters on the surface of the limb buds.",

The rate of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in hepatocytes was determined by measuring the extent of incorporation of labeled thymidine into DNA, using a scintillation counter; results were expressed per unit of DNA. The rate of UDS in treated cell cultures ranged from 0.34-1.67 times that of the negative control, indicating that the test compound was negative for UDS in human fibroblasts under the conditions of this assay. Positive control treatment with 4-nitroquinoline oxide (1X10E-5 M) produced the expected high increase in UDS (42.7 times that of solvent control).",

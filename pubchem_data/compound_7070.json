When heated to decomposition, 3,3-dichlorobenzidine emits toxic fumes of chlorinated compounds and nitrogen oxides.  The primary routes of potential human exposure to 3,3-dichlorobenzidine are inhalation of airborne dust, ingestion of contaminated well water by those living near hazardous waste sites, and dermal contact, primarily during industrial operations. Contact with this compound may cause dermatitis. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)",

Hemoglobin adducts were hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions, and the arylamines analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. With benzidine, three cleavage products were observed, the major component being monoacetylbenzidine. This indicates that 4-nitroso-4'-N- acetylaminobiphenyl is the major reactive metabolite in erythrocytes. In addition benzidine and 4-aminobiphenyl were identified. With 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine dihydrochloride, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine and 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine two cleavage products were observed, the parent diamines being present in excess to or in amounts comparable to the monoacetyl derivative. With 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine a hemoglobin adduct could not be found. When the azo dye direct red 28 was administered to the animals, the three cleavage products typical for benzidine were found, indicating that benzidine became bioavailable after reductive cleavage of the azo compound. In this case the fraction of 4-aminobiphenyl was greater than after benzidine. It is proposed to use the analysis of hemoglobin adducts in human blood to control the exposure of individuals to these carcinogenic chemicals in the course of biochemical effect monitoring.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

The available data suggest that the metabolism of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine begins with the formation of nitroso derivatives which yield a sulfinic acid amide with hemoglobin in erythrocytes. This has been suggested to be a mechanism for adduct formation. However, N-oxidation at one of the two nitrogens could occur in the parent diamine, the monoacetyl, or the diacetyl derivative. N-Hydroxy-dichlorobenzidine and N-hydroxy-N'-acetyl-dichlorobenzidine could arise from either direct N-oxidation of the amino group or by deacetylation of the hydroxamic acid. Peroxidative activation of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine will yield 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine diimine which causes DNA damage in bladder which might be responsible for tumor formation in this target in dogs and possibly humans. In rodents, N-oxidation of the monoacetyl derivative is an important step of metabolic activation ... .",

Several studies have investigated excretion of metabolites in urine, hemoglobin adduction and cancer incidence among workers exposed occupationally to DCB. In these researches, metabolites of DCB had a very important role. The purpose of this study was to develop the urinary monitoring method of its metabolites from rats exposed with DCB, by easily synthesizing them in the laboratory. N,N'-diacetyl-DCB was easily synthesized with DCB in pyridine by adding sufficient acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride. N-acetyl-DCB was isolated from the supernatant, which made by adding 21/microL acetyl chloride (more 3 times than DCB in moles) to 32 mg DCB in 2 mL pyridine and 0.3 mL acetic acid. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used for the identification, gas chromatography nitrogen phosphorous detection (GC-NPD) for the quantification and gas chromatography flame ionization detection (GC-FID) for the determination of purity. The base peak of DCB, N-acetyl-DCB and N,N'-diacetyl-DCB was 252 m/z. The other main peaks were 294 m/z for N-acetyl-DCB, and 294 and 336 m/z for N,N'-diacetyl-DCB. The purities of N-acetyl-DCB and N,N'-diacetyl-DCB were identified as 98.82 and 98.72% by GC-FID, respectively. After treatment orally to rats with 20 mg DCB/kg body weight for 2 weeks, the urinary excretion amount of DCB was nearly constant at range of 0.11-0.18 mg/L for 2 weeks. But excretion of N-acetyl-DCB was continually increased from 1.30 mg/L on 1st day to 4.15 mg/L on 14th day. And level of N,N'-diacetyl-DCB in urine was sharply increased from 2.13 mg/L on 1st day to 11.00 mg/L on 14th day.",

Chronic (long-term) exposure may result in effects on the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and central nervous system (CNS) in humans. A human study detected a possible association between benzidine-based azodyes (including 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine).

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

It is used in the United States primarily in the manufacture of pigments for printing ink, textiles, paper, paint, rubber, and plastics and as a curing agent for isocyanate-containing polymers and solid urethane plastics. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Dermal exposure to 3,3'-DCB base has caused dermatitis in dye workers. A significant increase in cancer of the blood cells (mostly leukemia) was found among dye-manufacturing workers exposed only to 3,3'-DCB. DCB is capable of inducing DNA damage and some cellular stress responses in HepG2 cells. It has caused unscheduled DNA synthesis in human fibroblasts. Effective biological monitoring was achieved by a combination of monitoring hemoglobin adducts with spot samplings of urinary DCB excretion. DCB is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. ANIMAL STUDIES: DCB or its dihydrochloride caused tumors in several species of experimental animals, at several different tissue sites, and by several different routes of exposure. Dietary administration of DCB caused mammary-gland cancer (adenocarcinoma) in rats of both sexes, granulocytic leukemia and Zymbal-gland cancer (carcinoma) in male rats, urinary-bladder cancer (transitional-cell or papillary transitional-cell carcinoma) in hamsters and in female dogs, and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) in female dogs. Subcutaneous injection of DCB caused skin and mammary-gland tumors in rats. Prenatal exposure to DCB in mice caused lymphoid leukemia, and dietary exposure caused liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) in males. Purified and technical grade DCB had some direct mutagenic activity toward Salmonella typhimurium TA1538, but this was increased over 50-fold by activation. DCB injected ip into mice at low concentration increased, and at high concentration, decreased the sister chromatid exchange frequency in bone marrow cells.",

No change was seen in liver when 3'3-dichlorobenzidine was given alone. Incidence of urinary bladder tumors was not significantly incr when 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine was added to diet.",

This was proposed in a study in which no carcinomas were found in any rats admin one of the following: 0.03% 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine in the diet, 0.001% BBN (N-butyl-N-(hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine) in drinking water, 0.0005% 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) in the diet, or 0.04% N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide (FANFT) in the diet for a period of 40 wk ... . However, when BBN plus 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine were fed together at the same dose levels as above, there was a marked incr in the presence of papillary or nodular hyperplasia in the rat bladder, and the appearance of one papilloma. Based on these findings, the authors suggested that 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine had a synergistic effect on the cacinogenicity of BBN. In rats sequentially admin BBN (0.01%), FANFT (0.15%), 2-AAF (0.025%), and 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine (0.03%) for 4 wk each, the incidence of bladder cancer after admin of the 4 chemicals was no different than after admin of the first 3, suggesting no interactive effect of any type for 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine ...",

It is also used in tattoo inks. In this article, we investigate light-induced toxicity of DCB in both bacteria and human Jurkat T-cells. DCB itself is not toxic or mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA102, but is photomutagenic at concentrations as low as 2 microM and phototoxic at concentrations >100 microM when bacteria are exposed to DCB and light at the same time (1.2 J/cm2 of UVA and 2.1 J/cm2 of visible light). Furthermore, DCB is both photocytotoxic and photogenotoxic to human Jurkat T-cells. Under a light irradiation dose of 2.3 J/cm2 of UVA and 4.2 J/cm2 of visible light, it causes the Jurkat T-cells to become nonviable in a DCB dose-dependent manner and the nonviable cells reaches 60% at DCB concentrations higher than 50 microM. At the same time, DNA fragmentation is observed for cells exposed to both DCB and light, determined by single cell gel electrophoresis (alkaline comet assay). As much as 5% (average) DNA fragmentation was observed when exposed to 200 microM DCB and light irradiation. This suggests that DCB can penetrate the cell membrane and enter the cell. Upon light activation, DCB in the cells can cause various cellular damages, leading to nonviable Jurkat T-cells. It appears, the nonviable cells are not caused solely by fragmentation of cellular DNA, but by other damages such as to proteins and cell membranes, or DNA alkylation. Therefore, persons exposed to DCB through environmental contamination or through tattoo piercing using DCB-containing inks must not only concern about its toxicity without exposing to light, but also its phototoxicity.",

The possible role of benzidine-based azodyes as a carcinogenic risk factor for painters in a major industrial area of Germany was investigated ... . The cohort consisted of 403 male patients (case group) treated in the period 1984-1987 for urological tumors: 290 had a diagnosis of bladder carcinoma & 113 had a diagnosis of bladder papilloma. The mean duration of employment was 29 yr (range 2-48 yr). A comparison group (reference group) of 426 patients with benign prostate disease was also included in the study. Cases & controls responded to questionnaires regarding employment history. Questionnaires were analyzed for occupational categories. A painter was defined as a person employed in this occupation for at least 6 months at any time of his working history & who had never been employed in another occupation known to be causally associated with bladder cancer. Of the bladder tumor patients, 21 were painters; among referents, 8 were painters. This difference among the groups was statistically significant; the relative risk of painters to be associated with bladder tumor was 2.76 (p<0.01). Occupation as painter (primarily house painter) was far more frequent among bladder tumor patients than would be expected from census data. The relative risk of bladder tumors for current smokers & ex-smokers was 1.13, which ... /suggested/ that the risk of smoking for bladder tumors was less than the occupational risk for the painters. The authors noted that a large number of benzidine-based azodyes were manufactured in Germany in the past. During that time it was usual for painters to prepare the paints themselves, allowing for possible exposure to dyes & pigments derived from benzidine, 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine (o-tolidine), 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine (o-dianisidine), & 2-naphthylamine. While the results of this study suggest that occupational exposure to benzidine-like chemicals is associated with an increased incidence in bladder tumors, the specific role of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, if any, is unknown. /Benzidine-based azodyes/",

However, strict regulations requiring its use in closed systems should limit its potential for release. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.1X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 hours. Particulate-phase 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and has been shown to photolyze rapidly in aqueous solution; therefore, it is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight in all environmental media. If released to soil, 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine is expected to have low to no mobility based upon a Koc range in the range of 721-33,720 measured in a variety of soils and sediment samples. Aromatic amines like 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine are known to bind to soils containing a large organic carbon content due to the ability of the aromatic amino group to form covalent bonds with humic and fulvic material in soils; these complexes are often irreversibly bound and immobile. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation is expected to occur slowly in soils and it has been reported that 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine may last for months in soil. When incubated in soil under aerobic conditions, only 2% mineralization was observed in 32 weeks and no mineralization was observed under anaerobic conditions in 52 weeks. If released into water, 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc data. Biodegradation is expected to occur slowly in water. A biodegradation half-life of about 150 days was observed in a lake sediment and water slurry. Half-lives of 4-26 weeks and 16-101 weeks have been estimated for the biodegradation of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine in surface water and anaerobic groundwater, respectively. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A BCF range of 43-856 in fish suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms will be moderate to high. 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine has been shown to undergo photolysis rapidly (half-life of approximately 1 minute) in aqueous solution which suggests that photolysis will be an important environmental fate process in surface waters exposed to sunlight. Hydrolysis is not an important environmental fate process. Occupational exposure to 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine is produced or used. The general population may be exposed when living near factories or disposal sites, through plant effluents or groundwater contamination. An additional source of exposure is the use of consumer products containing benzidine congener-based dyes, which can be contaminated with the respective amine, and also via uptake of the dyes from those products and ensuing metabolization.

Aromatic amines like 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine and substituted anilines are known to bind to soils containing a large organic carbon content due to the ability of the aromatic amino group to form covalent bonds with humic and fulvic material in soils(5); these complexes are often irreversibly bound and immobile(5). Volatilization of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(6). 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 4.1X10-6 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(6). A 1% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test indicates that 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine is not readily biodegradable(7). Biodegradation is expected to occur slowly in soils(SRC) and it has been reported that 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine may last for months in soil(8). When incubated in soil under aerobic conditions, only 2% mineralization occurred in 32 weeks(2); under anaerobic conditions no mineralization occurred in a year(2). 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(9) and has been shown to photolyze rapidly in aqueous solution(10); therefore, it may be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).[(1) Swann RL et al; Res Rev 85: 17-28 (1983) (2) Boyd SA et al; Environ Toxicol Chem 3: 201-8 (1984) (3) Donaldson FP, Nyman MC; Environ Toxicol Chem 24: 1022-28 (2005) (4) Nyman MC et al; Environ Sci Technol 31: 1068-73 (1997) (5) Adrian P et al; Chemosphere 18: 1599-609 (1989) (6) US EPA; Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(5). According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF range of 43-856 measured in fish(7-9), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. A 1% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test indicates that 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine is not readily biodegradable(9). 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine is expected to biodegrade slowly in water. The half-life of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine in a lake water and sediment slurry was approximately 150 days(2). Half-lives of 4-26 weeks and 16-101 weeks have been estimated for the biodegradation of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine in surface water and anaerobic groundwater, respectively(11). 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine has been shown to undergo rapid photolysis in aqueous solution yielding monochlorobenzidine, benzidine and other water insoluble products(12,13). The short half-life of this reaction (approximately 1 minute)(13) suggests that photolysis in sunlit surface waters will be an important environmental fate process(SRC). Hydrolysis is not an important environmental fate process for 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine(14).",

Vapor-phase 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) determined using a structure estimation method(2). 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and has been shown to photolyze rapidly in aqueous solution(4); therefore, it is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).

Under anaerobic conditions no mineralization occurred in a year(3). 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine, present at 100 mg/L, achieved 1% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test which classified the compound as not readily biodegradable(4). The half-life of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine in a lake water and sediment slurry obtained from Lake Macatawa, MI was approximately 150 days(5). 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine dihydrochloride was not readily biodegradable by microorganisms obtained from freshwater lakes and incubated for 28 and 30 days or in an activated sludge study(6,7). These data suggest that biodegradation of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine will occur slowly in the environment(SRC). Half-lives of 4-26 weeks and 16-101 weeks have been estimated for the biodegradation of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine in surface water and anaerobic groundwater, respectively(8).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 10 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(2) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine dihydrochloride was shown to undergo rapid photolysis in aqueous solution yielding monochlorobenzidine, benzidine and other water insoluble products(3). The half-life of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine in aqueous solution irradiated at 310 nm was approximately 1 minute(4). The photolysis half-life of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine dihydrochloride in water is reported to be 5-30 minutes under artificial laboratory light and 90 seconds in direct natural sunlight(5). The hydrolysis half-life of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine has been estimated as 100 days based on surrogate substances(5). Zero hydrolysis was observed after 5 days at 50 \u00b0C(5). 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine is an aromatic amine and aromatic amines in surface waters exposed to sunlight react with photo-oxidants (such as hydroxyl radicals, peroxy radicals and singlet oxygen) with a half-life on the order of 30 days(6).[(1) US EPA; Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Batch isotherm studies using five sandy to silty-clay sediment samples collected from Lake Macatawa (Holland, MI), measured Koc values ranging from 721 to 3,965(2); the majority of adsorption was determined to occur through covalent bonding(2). According to a classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggest that 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine is expected to have low to no mobility in soil. 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine is a weak base with pKa values of 3.2 and 1.6(4), indicating that this compound will exist primarily in the neutral form. Aromatic amines like benzidine, 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine and substituted anilines are known to bind to soils containing a large organic carbon content due to the ability of the aromatic amino group to form covalent bonds with humic and fulvic material in soils(5). These complexes are often irreversibly bound and immobile(5).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Methylation is catalysed by thiopurine methyltransferase in the cytoplasm and thiol methyltransferase in microsomes, and both reactions require S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl group donor. Thiopurine methyltransferase is present in human liver, kidney, and erythrocytes; preferential substrates for this enzyme include aromatic and heterocyclic thiols. S-Methylation of aliphatic thiols is catalysed by microsomal thiol methyltransferase, and the resulting methyl thioether (sulfide) metabolite would undergo S-oxidation to give the methyl sulfoxide and methyl sulfone analogues as urinary products. Thiols may react with glutathione and other endogenous thiol substances to form mixed disulfides. Both microsomal and cytoplasmic thioltransferasess have been reported to catalyse the formation of mixed disulfides. The resulting mixed disulfides can undergo reduction back to thiols, oxidative desulfuration, or oxidation to a sulfonic acid via the intermediate thiosulfinate and sulfinic acids. The principal form in the circulation would probably be a mixed disulfide formed with albumin. /Simple thiols/",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, dermal contact), exposure to this water-white liquid, with a strong disagreeable odor, may occur from its use as a solvent for dyestuffs and as a chemical intermediate in the production of pharmaceuticals, rubber chemicals, flotation agents, biochemical reagents, insecticides, plasticizers, reducing agents, PVC stabilizers, and agricultural chemicals. Effects from exposure may include irritation of the eyes, nose, and skin, headache, dizziness, urinary disturbances, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress or failure. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus, and protective clothing. If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. Contaminated clothing and shoes should be removed at the site. While 2-mercaptoethanol does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of poisonous gases. For fires involving this substance, extinguish withdry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or regular foam.  Small spills of this substance may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. Large spills should be diked far ahead of the spill for later disposal.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

During a 48-h experiment 15N-labelled glycine was given orally in a dose of 5 mg 15N.kg bw-1 and urine samples were collected and analysed by an emission spectrometric isotope method. Protein synthesis and nitrogen excretion rate constants were calculated according to the three-pool model, and 3-methylhistidine excretion rates were also determined. 2-Mercaptoethanol appears to influence protein metabolism; however, the slower rates of protein synthesis proved to be apparent in almost all groups of treated rats. Protein synthesis and nitrogen excretion rate constants have exceptionally high values in 2-year-old rats, possibly explained by the occurrence of hypercompensation mechanisms in old age. These were reflected by the excretion rates of 3-methylhistidine which were reduced as a result of sulphhydryl group interactions in age-dependent cellular metabolic changes.",

It could be stated that spontaneous death was more frequent in animals kept in cigarette smoke than in the control animals. Prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma was higher in animals kept in cigarette smoke than in the controls. After 2-ME treatment the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly lower and animals without disorders were more frequent than in smokers. Body weights were lower in animals kept in cigarette smoke and differences in organ indices could be observed, too. Immunological changes were also demonstrated: in mice kept in cigarette smoke the reactivity against a foreign antigen such as sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) was lower, while after 2-ME treatment it was higher than in their controls using direct plaque formation technique. The ratio of normal reactivity (against SRBC) and autoreactivity (against mouse erythrocytes) showed a decrease in smoker animals, and an increase in the 2-ME-treated ones. The experiments showed a deleterious effect of cigarette smoke and a beneficial effect of 2-ME on age-related alterations.",

It is a hydrolysis product of the chemical warfare agent mustard gas. 2-Mercaptoethanol is formed through the decomposition of naturally occurring products such as swine manure and proteins (produced by marine algae and other marine plants). If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 1.76 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-mercaptoethanol will exist solely as a vapor. Vapor-phase 2-mercaptoethanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8.5 hours. 2-Mercaptoethanol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-mercaptoethanol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.3. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Mercaptoethanol may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A 29% biomineralization after 55 days under methanogenic conditions indicates that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in anoxic environments. If released into water, 2-mercaptoethanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.0 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-mercaptoethanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-mercaptoethanol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-mercaptoethanol via dermal contact with this compound and other products containing 2-mercaptoethanol. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

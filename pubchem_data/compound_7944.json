When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.56 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 28 hours (1.2 days). If released to soil, bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon a Koc of 47. It may be resistant to biodegradation in environmental media based upon screening test data from studies using activated sludge or sewage inocula. Many ethers are known to be resistant to biodegradation. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based on the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based on its estimated Henry's Law constant. The volatilization half-life from a model river and a model lake is estimated as approximately 19 hours and 10 days, respectively. A BCF of 5.2 to 12 suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether is not expected to hydrolyze in the environment due to lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. The most probable routes of general population exposure to bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether are via inhalation of contaminated air and ingestion of contaminated drinking water. Inhalation and dermal exposure will be expected to be highest in workplaces where bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether is made and used. (SRC)",

Aqueous screening test data from studies using activated sludge(5,6) suggest that bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether may be resistant to biodegradation in environmental media(SRC). In one study, bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether showed no biodegradation after 5 days when incubated with Ohio River water(7). In general, many ethers are known to be resistant to biodegradation(8). By analogy to bis(2-chloroethyl) ether, which has a hydrolytic half-life of about 20 years(9), hydrolysis of bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC).",

Bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its water solubility(4) and vapor pressure(4). Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 19 hours and 10 days, respectively(3,SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), a BCF of 5.2 to 12(6) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether may be resistant to biodegradation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in environmental media based upon screening test data from studies using activated sludge(6,7SRC). In one study, bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether showed no biodegradation after 5 days when incubated with Ohio River water(8). In general, many ethers are known to be resistant to biodegradation(9). By analogy to bis(2-chloroethyl)ether, which has a hydrolytic half-life of about 20 years(10), hydrolysis of bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Three bank infiltration studies from the Rhine river in The Hague showed a concentration of approximately 0.5 ug/l, which was not reduced at all after infiltration(2). In the Netherlands, 33% removal in <1 yr and 90% removal in <3 months was observed after bank and dune infiltration of Rhine water, respectively(3). A degradation half-life has been estimated to be 59 days and 3.1 days for bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether in a lake in the Rhine basin and in the Rhine river, respectively, based upon field monitoring data (includes dilution and evaporation)(3). AEROBIC SCREENING STUDIES: Bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether, present at 100 mg/l, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum(4). Bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether did not degrade after an experimental period of 40 days under aerobic conditions(5). In a static-culture-flask biodegradation screening procedure, utilizing biochemical oxygen demand and dilution water containing 5 mg of yeast extract per liter as the synthetic medium, bis(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) ether was found to be significantly biodegradable with rapid adaptation. At a test concentration of 5 mg/l, the original culture achieved 85% biodegradation in 7 days and subcultures 100% in 7 days; when the test concentration was 10 mg/l, 63% biodegradation of the original culture was observed in 7 days and 100% in subcultures(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

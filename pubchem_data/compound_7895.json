Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Male mice of ICR strain were exposed to about 5% n-pentane for one hour while the oxygen in the environmental air was maintained at about 20%. Then their blood and liver tissue were collected and analyzed by means of GC and GC-MS. The metabolites thus obtained were 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol and 2-pentanone. ... In the presence of the NADPH-generating system liver microsomes were made to react to the substrate of saturated n-pentane or isopentane aqueous solution at 37 degrees C for one hour. As a result, the same metabolites were produced as obtained in the exposure experiment. It was therefore suggested that n-pentane ... /was/ metabolized chiefly by liver microsomes. Male mice of ICR strain were fed with 80 mg/kg b.w. of phenobarbital for consecutive four days and exposed to n-pentane ...  for one hour.

In this study, a strain of the dimorphic black yeast Exophiala lecanii-corni, which has been shown to degrade high concentrations of toluene in a bioreactor, was evaluated for its ability to degrade a variety of VOCs, both individually and in mixtures. The fungus was found to be able to use toluene, ethyl benzene, methyl propyl ketone, n-butyl acetate, and ethyl ethoxypropionate as sole sources of carbon and energy; however, E. lecanii-corni was unable to degrade either xylene or benzene. When mixtures of chemicals were added to cultures of E. lecanii-corni, the fungus again degraded all of the chemicals except xylene and benzene. ...  . These preliminary studies indicate that E. Lecanii-corni would be a feasible organism to use in biofiltration due to its ability to degrade a wide range of VOCs, even under harsh environmental conditions.",

The biofilter, packed with cubed polyurethane foam media and operated with an empty bed residence time of 15s, was supplied with a four-component mixture of n-butyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, and toluene at target influent concentrations of 124, 50.5, 174, and 44.6 mg/cu m, respectively. This corresponds to a total VOC loading rate of 94.3g/(cu m.hr). Biofilter performance was evaluated over a 94-day period for three loading conditions intended to simulate processes generating contaminated gases only during daytime operation, daytime operation with weekend shutdown periods, and with long term (9-day) shutdown. Results indicate that fungal biofilters can be an effective alternative to conventional abatement technologies for treating solvent contaminated off-gases even under discontinuous loading conditions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Peroxide formation can be initiated by exposure to air, self-polymerization, or solvent impurities. Once formed, organic peroxides are sensitive to thermal or mechanical shock and can be violently explosive in concentrated solutions or as solids.",

Nasal pungency was measured in subjects lacking a functional sense of smell (i.e., anosmics) to avoid interference from olfaction. Various degrees of stimulus agonism (additive effects) were observed for each of the three sensory channels when testing mixtures. As the number of components and the lipophilicity of such components in the mixtures decreased, so did the degree of agonism. Synergistic stimulus agonism characterized the eye-irritation response for the most complex (the nine-component) and the most lipophilic (one of the six-component) mixtures. Physicochemical properties play a large role in the determination of sensitivity to airborne chemicals, particularly to their ability to evoke irritation. While this has revealed itself previously with respect to single chemicals, it seems to have relevance to mixtures as well.",

Eye irritation thresholds were well above odor thresholds for all series. Both sensory thresholds declined with carbon chain length, a trend that has implicated lipophilicity in the potency of these and related stimuli. Eye irritation thresholds were remarkably close to nasal pungency thresholds obtained previously in persons lacking olfaction (i.e. anosmics). The agreement between the two thresholds implies that, despite differences in the mucus layer at the two sites and in the epithelial tissue itself, there is remarkable similarity at the site of stimulation. As a practical matter, the eyes could serve as the sites to assess potency for induction of nasal pungency, an assessment previously limited to testing anosmics. Presumably, for our brief stimulus presentations (1-3 sec), the differences between ocular and nasal mucosae have little relevance to chemical sensitivity. ...",

It is released into the environment as a plant volatile as well as a product of combustion, photooxidation, and microbial degradation. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 35.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-pentanone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-pentanone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.5 days. 2-Pentanone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-pentanone is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 75. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.36X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Pentanone may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 2-Pentanone has been shown to biodegrade under aerobic conditions. If released into water, 2-pentanone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. 2-Pentanone is expected to biodegrade in water based on a screening test designed to simulate a polluted river, where the 5 day theoretical BOD for 2-pentanone was 43%. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 hours and 6.6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-pentanone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-pentanone is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-pentanone via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound or other products containing 2-pentanone.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

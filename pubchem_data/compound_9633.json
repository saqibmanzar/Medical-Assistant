PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Skin absorption is insignificant, except in patients with skin breakdown (e.g., burns, ulcers, severe ichthyosis). Increased metabolic rate can lead to greater inhalational absorption as well. Peak blood levels occur soon after inhalation but occur in 1 to 2 hours after oral administration. The chemicals distribute to tissues with high blood flow (e.g., brain, heart, liver, kidney) and then to adipose tissue, where the highest chemical concentrations are typically found. Halogenated hydrocarbons are metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P-450 oxidation. Partial glutathione conjugation may occur. Halogenated solvents can be excreted unchanged through the lungs. Elimination half-lives can be increased because of either prolonged exposure or hepatic dysfunction. Prolonged exposure allows more chemical to be stored in the adipose tissue, which serves as a source of continued release. /Halogenated Hydrocarbons - Halogenated Solvents/",

Male Fisher rats were exposed to halothane, HCFC- 124, HFC-125, HCFC-123 and HFC-134a. At the end of the exposure, animals were placed in metabolism cages and urinary trifluoroacetic acid excretion was measured. The presence of trifluoroacetylated-hepatic protein was assessed by means of SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-TFA-protein serum. The potential to form trifluoroacetylated-hepatic protein has the following decreasing order: Halothane . HCFC-123 >> HCFC-124 > HFC-125. TFA-proteins were not detected in samples from rats exposed to HFC-134a. 19F-NMR analysis of urinary TFA excretion confirmed the previous order of reactivity. The increased fluorination on the dihalomethyl group (- CX2H) decreases the metabolism of these compounds in vivo. HFC-125 showed a lower potential to form TFA in liver when compared to other halogenated ethanes.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

More than 99% of HFC-125 produced worldwide used as a blend component for commercial refrigeration and air conditioning systems. The use as a fire-extinguishing agent in total flooding systems is another application of HFC-125. Minor applications include the use of HFC-125 in plastic foam blowing and as a solvent in special applications. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: A chromosomal aberration test was carried out in human lymphocytes exposed up to 700,000 ppm (3,436,000 mg/cu m) HFC-125 for 3, 24 and 48 hours, with and without metabolic activation. This study gave clearly negative results. ANIMAL STUDIES: Rats (males and females) were exposed to 800,000 ppm (3,927,000 mg/cu m) HFC-125 in atmosphere for 4 hours. No mortality was observed within 14 days after the exposure. During the exposure, clinical signs typical of an anesthetic effect, such as abnormal respiration and ataxic gait, were observed. These effects disappeared within 1 hour after the end of the exposure period. Cardiac sensitization potential of HFC-125 following adrenaline injection was studied in beagle dogs. Two dogs exposed respectively to 200,000 and 300,000 ppm HFC-125 showed fatal ventricular fibrillation. In 13-week study, groups of male and female rats were exposed to 0, 5,000, 15,000 and 50,000 ppm (0, 24.544, 73,632 and 245,440 mg/cu m) HFC-125 (6 hrs/day, 5 days/week). Additional groups of male and female rats were designated for a 4-week recovery period. No mortality was found at any dose. Pregnant female rabbits were exposed to levels of 0, 5,000, 15,000 or 50,000 ppm (0, 24.544, 73,632 and 245,440 mg/cu m) for 6 hrs/day during the gestation days 6-18 and sacrificed on day 29 of gestation. There was no evidence of any treatment-related morphological change or of increased incidence of visceral and skeletal anomalies or variants. Pregnant female rats were exposed to levels of 0, 5,000, 15,000 or 50,000 ppm (0, 24.544, 73,632 and 245,440 mg/cu m) for 6 hrs/day during the gestation days 6-15 and sacrificed on day 20 of gestation. No statistically-significant differences in the incidence of anomalies and variants were observed during visceral and skeletal examination of fetuses among the control and the treated groups. An erythrocyte micronucleus test was performed in mice. No significant changes were observed in the ratio of polychromated to mature cells among the control group and the groups treated with HFC-125. A cytogenetic assay for the study of chromosomal aberrations was carried out in Chinese hamster ovary cells exposed to concentrations up to 700,000 ppm (3,436,000 mg/cu m) for 4 hours and up to 600,000 ppm (2,945,000 mg/cu m) for 24 and 48 hours, with and without metabolic activation. Positive results were observed only after 48 hours of exposure to 600,000 ppm HFC-125 in the absence of metabolic activation. However, the increased incidence of chromosomal aberration, observed under this experimental condition was concurrent with clear evidence of cytotoxicity. HFC-125 up to 200,000 ppm (982,000 mg/cu m) was tested in 2 strains of Salmonella typhimurium, with and without metabolic activation. Negative results were obtained with both strains.",

Inhaled fluorocarbons sensitize the myocardium to catecholamines, frequently resulting in lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Because they are gases heavier than air, fluorocarbons can displace atmospheric oxygen, thus resulting in asphyxiation. These compounds also have a central nervous system anesthetic effect analogous to a structurally similar general anesthetic, halothane. Pressurized refrigerant or liquid fluorocarbons with a low boiling point have a cryogenic effect on exposed tissues, causing frostbite, laryngeal or pulmonary edema, and gastrointestinal perforation. /Freons/",

The animals were initially tested for cardiac sensitivity to adrenaline alone, in order to establish the response dose (varying from 1 to 12 ug/kg for different animals). HFC-125 effects were compared to Halon 13B1 and to the reference (positive control) CFC-11. CFC-11 at a concentration of 25,000 ppm (122,720 mg/cu m) in air gave fatal ventricular fibrillation and multiple ectopic beats in 2/2 tested dogs. Six dogs were first exposed to 50,000 Halon 13B1, and then the same dogs were exposed to 100,000 HFC 125; these dogs were alternately exposed to increasing concentrations of Halon 13B1 and HFC 125. The same dogs were used for each successive exposure until a clear positive response was observed (5 or more apparently multifocal ventricular ectopic beats or ventricular fibrillation). Any dog with a positive response was removed from the experiment; it was assumed that the dogs exhibiting a positive response would also exhibit positive responses at all higher concentrations of the subject compound. Halon 13B1 and HFC-125 gave positive responses at 200,000 ppm (981,759 mg/cu m) (2/6 animals) and 100,000 ppm (490,879 mg/cu m) (1/6 animals), respectively. In this study the EC50 of HFC-125 for cardiac sensitization potential was between 100,000 and 150,000 ppm (490,879 and 736,319 mg/cu m) in air, and the NOEC was 75,000 ppm (368.160 mg/cu m). Two dogs exposed respectively to 200,000 and 300,000 ppm HFC-125 showed fatal ventricular fibrillation. A similar study was performed with a mixture of 36.5/63.5% v/v HFC-23/HFC-125. Exposure to 100,000 ppm (490,879 mg/cu m) of this mixture in air gave a positive response (fatal ventricular fibrillation) in one of six dogs.",

Additional groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were designated for a 4-week recovery period. No mortality was found at any dose. There were no treatment-related clinical signs of toxicity or significant differences in body weight gains and food consumption among the control and the treated groups. No statistical differences were observed in hematology, blood biochemistry and urinalysis, in organ weights and in peroxisomal beta-oxidation activities. Gross pathology examinations revealed a white patch in the liver of one male and a cyst in the kidney of another male dosed at 50,000 ppm and thick ear of one female of 5,000 ppm group, one of 50,000 ppm group and one in the control group. Enlargement of the lymph node in one female and a cyst in the ovary of another female were observed in the 50,000 ppm group at the end of the recovery period. These findings were considered incidental. No treatment-related histopathological changes were observed and 50,000 ppm, was considered the NOAEC for this study.",

Two additional groups were exposed to 0 and 50,000 ppm HFC-125 and were allowed to recover for two weeks after the exposure period. No mortality was observed in this study. There were no treatment-related clinical signs of toxicity and differences in body weight and food consumption among the treated and the control groups, neither after the exposure nor after the recovery period. Some effects were observed in the hematology and blood chemistry analysis. In particular, a very slight, not dose-related increase in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration was measured in the males of all the treatment groups at the end of the exposure period; only the increase at the highest dose was statistically significant in comparison with the controls. Males exposed to 5,000 and 15,000, but not to 50,000 ppm, showed a slightly lower serum albumin content. A slight increase in serum phospholipids concentration was measured in the males of high-dosed group, at the end of exposure period. No hematological findings were observed in the recovery groups. Neither macroscopic nor microscopic changes were observed during gross pathology and histological examinations, respectively. Study of peroxisomal proliferation gave equivocal results, since a slightly higher activity of peroxisomal beta-oxidation was measured in the males of the high-dosed group in comparison to control; while a lower activity was measured in the females of the same group.",

Pentafluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Pentafluoroethane has an atmospheric life-time of 26-36.5 years. Pentafluoroethane has estimated 20, 100 and 500 year Global Warming Potentials of 4600-5738, 2800-3800 and 920-1100, respectively. If released to soil, pentafluoroethane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 140. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.049 atm-cu m/mole. Pentafluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Pentafluoroethane may biodegrade slowly under aerobic conditions, but is not expected to biodegrade under anaerobic conditions. If released into water, pentafluoroethane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.2 hours and 4.3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Pentafluoroethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 3.2 years and 120 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to pentafluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pentafluoroethane is produced or used. (SRC)",

Gas-phase pentafluoroethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 23 years(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.9X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Pentafluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Pentafluoroethane has an atmospheric life-time of 26-36.5 years(5-10). Pentafluoroethane has estimated 20, 100 and 500 year Global Warming Potentials of 4600-5738, 2800-3800 and 920-1100, respectively(6-10).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

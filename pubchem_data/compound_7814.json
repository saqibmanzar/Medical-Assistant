When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The permeability constants obtained for the dyes were compared with octanol/water and skin membrane/water partition coefficients.

Skin absorption of the dyes was observed when they were applied in an aqueous solution. With one exception, the octanol/water partition coefficients were in the same rank order as the permeability constants. The determination of the partitioning of the hair dyes between water and either stratum corneum or epidermis was more complex. Preliminary stratum corneum/water partition studies resulted in values that were in the reverse order of skin permeation. When binding of the compounds to components of the membrane was saturated, the partition values more closely duplicated the rank order of permeability of the dyes. Prediction of percutaneous absorption of substances based on their partition coefficients may be confounded if these compounds are capable of binding to skin.",

Acute (short-term) exposure to high levels of p-phenylenediamine may cause severe dermatitis, eye irritation and tearing, asthma, gastritis, renal failure, vertigo, tremors, convulsions, and coma in humans. Eczematoid contact dermatitis may result from chronic (long-term) exposure in humans. In rats and mice chronically exposed to p- phenylenediamine in their diet, depressed body weights, but no other clinical signs of toxicity, were observed in several studies. No information is available on the reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of p-phenylenediamine in humans. EPA has not classified p-phenylenediamine with respect to carcinogenicity.",

However, the revised IDLH for p\u00adphenylene diamine is 25 mg/m3 based on the concentration recommended originally in the Standards Completion Program for deciding when the most protective respirators should be used. Because sensitized workers may be affected by concentrations far below occupational exposure limits, exacerbation of asthma cannot be used to set an IDLH."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Neurotoxicity was assessed by functional operational battery and motor activity tests performed prior to treatment (baseline assessment) and at approximately 1.5 hours (time of maximal clinical signs), 24 hours, and 4 days post-gavage. Both females of all dose levels and males of 40 and 80 mg/kg dosage groups exhibited signs of a systemic toxicity with significantly reduced weight gain. These deviations from control were echoed in significantly reduced food consumption in all except 20 mg/kg females after Day 1 and in males of 80 mg/kg doses. No other clinical signs of toxicity were significantly dose-related. Upon the functional observation batteries through post-treatment Day 4, females only demonstrated significant dose-related malaise, postural changes, palpebral closure, and diminished arousal. Males showed similar functional aberrations which were not statistically significant relative to controls. Treatment was not significantly reflected in fore- or hind-limb grip strength or foot splay. Measurements of decreased motor activity in treated rats were significantly dose-related, except after Day 1 in both 20 mg/kg groups.",

Based on an extrapolated vapor pressure of 0.005 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C, 1,4-benzenediamine is expected to exist primarily as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,4-benzenediamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated atmospheric half-life of about 2 hours. If released to soil, 1,4-benzenediamine is expected to have high mobility based on an estimated Koc value of 16; however it may form covalent bonds to humic material which would limit its movement through soil. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected based upon the vapor pressure of this compound. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.7X10-10 atm-cu m/mol. Biodegradation is expected to occur slowly in moist and dry soils. In water, 1,4-benzenediamine is not expected to adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its estimated Koc value. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected based upon the estimated Henry's Law constant for this compound. Abiotic degradation of 1,4-benzenediamine by photochemically produced peroxy radicals is an important environmental fate process in surface waters. The half-life of this reaction has been estimated as about 1 day. The potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low based on an estimated BCF value of 0.3. A measured pKb value of 6.2 indicates that the protonated form of 1,4-benzenediamine will exist at environmentally significant pH and this may affect the environmental fate of this compound in aquatic environments. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,4-benzenediamine is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to this compound by dermal contact, primarily through the use of hair dyes containing 1,4-benzenediamine. (SRC)",

Degradation of 1,4-benzenediamine by photochemically produced peroxy radicals will be an important environmental fate process in surface waters(5,SRC). The half-life of this reaction is estimated as 1 day for a solution concentration of 1X10-9 M of peroxy radicals and an estimated rate constant of 1X10+4 L/mol-s(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF value of 0.3(3,SRC), from a measured log Kow of -0.3(2,SRC), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation in aquatic environments is not expected to be an important environmental fate process(SRC). A 0% theoretical oxygen demand was observed for 1,4-benzenediamine in a Warburg apparatus during a 5 day incubation period(7). A measured pKb value of 6.2 indicates that the protonated form of 1,4-benzenediamine will exist at environmentally significant pH and this may affect the environmental fate of this compound in aquatic environments(8).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1,SRC). A measured pKb value of 6.2 indicates that 1,4-benzenediamine is expected to exist in the protonated form at environmentally significant pH values(2,SRC). Abiotic degradation of 1,4-benzenediamine by photochemically produced peroxy radicals is an important environmental fate process in surface waters(3,SRC). The rate constant for this reaction has been estimated as 1X10+4 L/mol-s at 25 \u00b0C(3). This corresponds to a half-life of about 1 day for a solution concentration of 1X10-9 M of peroxy radicals(3). 1,4-Benzenediamine adsorbs UV light above 290 nm (UV maximum 308 nm(4)) and therefore may undergo direct photolysis in the environment by sunlight. 53.7% Photooxidation of a 1,4-diaminobenzene dihydrochloride sample (initial concentration unspecified) on a silica gel substrate was observed when irradiated with light above 290 nm for 17 hours(5).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

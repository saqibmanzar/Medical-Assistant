Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Doses were administered for 103 weeks for rats ... . Groups of 50 rats ... of each sex received corn oil by gavage on the same dosing schedule and served as vehicle controls. ... Survival of high-dose rats of each sex was significantly (p < 0.05) less than that of the controls. Mean body weights of dosed male and female rats were lower than those of the corresponding controls during the second year of the study. Final mean body weights for rats were 4%-5% lower for male rats and 8%-12% lower for female rats when compared to controls. Chronic, diffuse inflammation of the kidney, distinguishable from nephropathy seen in aging F344/N rats, was found in male rats in a significant (p < 0.001) and dose-related incidence (control, 4/50, 8%; low-dose, 14/49, 29%; high-dose, 33/50, 66%). Mineralization of the renal papilla, considered to be secondary to chronic inflammation, was also observed at increase incidences in dosed male rats. Pentachloroethane administration did not cause any increased incidences of tumors in either male or female rats. Statistically significant negative trends were detected for subcutaneous tissue fibromas amoung males and for pituitary adenomas in both sexes. ... Under the conditions of this bioassay, technical grade pentachloroethane containing 4.2% hexachloroethane was not carcinogenic in F344/N rats. ... Pentachloroethane was nephrotoxic to male rats.",

Doses were administered for ... 41-103 weeks for mice. Groups of ... 50 mice of each sex received corn oil by gavage on the same dosing schedule and served as vehicle controls. ... Forty-two high-dose male mice died by week 41, and the 8 remaining animals in the group were killed at that time. Twenty-five male control mice were killed at week 44 to serve as controls for the high-dose males. Only 22/50 (44%) of the low-dose male mice survived to the end of the study. All high-dose female mice were dead by week 74, and only 9/50 (18%) low-dose females survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of mice were lower than those of controls. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly elevated in all groups of dosed mice (male: 4/48, 8%; 26/44, 59%, p< 0.001; 7/45, 16%; female: 1/46, 2% 28/42, 67%, p< 0.001; 13/45, 29% p< 0.001). Early mortalities in the high-dose male mice precluded an evaluation of their lifetime incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. There was a significant increase in incidence over that observed among 25 controls killed at week 44 (0/25 versus 7/45, p< 0.05). There was also a significant (p< 0.001) dose-related increase in hepatocellular adenoma in female mice (2/46, 4%; 8/42, 19%; 19/45, 42%). ...

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.50 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pentachloroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pentachloroethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 69 days. Pentachloroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pentachloroethane is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,340. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Pentachloroethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The importance of biodegradation is inconclusive as similar results were observed in sterile and non-sterile anoxic biodegradation tests. If released into water, pentachloroethane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 6 days, respectively. A BCF value of 67 suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. The hydrolysis half-life of pentachloroethane was calculated to be 3.7 days at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7. Occupational exposure to pentachloroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pentachloroethane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to pentachloroethane via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Volatilization of pentachloroethane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure of 3.50 mm Hg(4) and water solubility of 4.90X10+2 mg/L(5). Pentachloroethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). Similar degradation rates (90-100% loss in 30 days) were obtained during sterile and non-sterile anoxic biodegradation tests; therefore, the degradation of pentachloroethane in soil is expected to be dominated by abiotic processes(6,7).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 3.50 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 4.90 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 6 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), a measured BCF of 67(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Similar results were observed in sterile and non-sterile degradation tests; therefore, the degradation of pentachloroethane in water is expected to be dominated by abiotic processes(8,9). The hydroloysis half-life of pentachloroethane was calculated to be 3.7 days at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7(10).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that pentachloroethane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 6 days(SRC). Pentachloroethane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of pentachloroethane from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon the vapor pressure(1). The volatilization half-life of a dilute solution of pentachloroethane in a beaker 6.5 cm deep, stirred 200 rpm in still air has been experimentally determined to be 46.5 minutes(4).",
